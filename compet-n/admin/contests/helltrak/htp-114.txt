Description             : Total credit to Vile for this awesome trick -
                          I modified it slightly from his demo because the
                          jump is a lot lot easier to this side of the track
                          and there's no need for the sphere health. BTW,
                          for NM it's perfectly possible to just turn around
                          after going through the pit lane and head back
                          for the blue armour, so that should be possible
                          on this route too.
