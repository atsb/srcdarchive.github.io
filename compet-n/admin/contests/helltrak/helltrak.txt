Cheesy Storyline (TM)   : 
(not to be taken seriously :)

You never thought this would happen to you.

You returned victorious so many times you lost track of the count.
Cyber daddies, spider bitches, icons of sin, they were no longer
match for you. You became a one-member hall of fame.

Years passed after your retirement, and you became less aware
of danger. That was a fatal mistake - you forgot that they never
rest.

They came at night, and in large numbers. You were sleeping, you
had no chance to resist. Full of confidence, they sent their lowliest
troops, imps. You have been scratched to death by imps!

Of course, with your past, you could not go to Heaven. The irony is
that you've done much more for them than they ever done for you.
The hellspawn took you down to Hell - a place you already knew too well.

To cut a long story short, you were cast into a prison cell of some sort
with other humans, down in the heart of Hell. After a while, you realized
what this was for - apparently they used the humans as some type of modern
gladiators in a running arena, which was placed in a lava lake. The contestant
had to make three laps in a closed circuit with limited weaponry and
ammunition - looks like the hellspawn enjoyed their own kind being killed
in this twisted spectacle. They always made sure that no human managed to
finish the run. Either way or the other, the contestant ended up wiping
the floor with his innards. Really gruesome - and you heard another
death scream from your cell every day.

You got to know your fellow inmates fairly well, though. There was one
guy who stood out from the rest. He was a bible salesman, they sent
him down right from Heaven to distribute the Holy Book. (Talk about
aggressive marketing strategy.) Somehow, he wasn't popular around
here - and that's how he got locked up in this cage.

Then one day (not that you could make difference between light and day
anymore), you heard the cage door squeaking open, and one of the hellspawn
coming in. It hissed at you, and that meant only one thing - it was your turn.
As you went past the bible salesman guy, he grabbed your hand which revealed
a small pistol in your palm which you've hidden there. None of the hellspawn
have noticed luckily, they were too excited about the upcoming show.
The bible salesman looked at the gun and said:
'No one has ever done anything like this.'
'That's why it's going to work.' you said.

You were tossed onto the pentagram gate and teleported right onto the track.
As you looked around, you saw volcanic rock structures in a deep lake of molten
lava. For a moment, you thought your skin was going to melt, but you've proven
too tough for Hell to contain numerous times.

You know this is your only chance to free your tortured soul.

Get running.
