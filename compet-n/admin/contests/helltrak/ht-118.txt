Contest #10 Entry

Run type: UV speed + trick

Description: I knew I would find a shortcut eventually, and this is it. :)
             The real disadvantage of this trick is not being able to have
             any armor for the one lap necessary, which makes nightmare a bitch.
             This shouldn't really be accepted as a true contest entry, but it's
             a cool trick. :)
