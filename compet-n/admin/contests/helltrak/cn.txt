This is the 10th contest at COMPET-N, and the first one featuring a level from scratch, designed
especially for speedrunning.<br>
First, get the map <a href="http://ural2.hszk.bme.hu/~ha211/compet-n/mods/helltrak.zip">here</a>.<br>
Categories:<br>
<li>UV Speed (fairly easy)
<li>NM Speed (quite a challenge but possible)
<li>UV Max (this might not be as much fun, the map was primarily designed for running. Still, possible)
<li>NM100S (see NM Speed, this map does not have secrets)
<li>UV -fast (this will be a challenge I think)
<li>UV -respawn (yes, very different from Max, and much more fun)
<li>UV Pacifist (I certainly could see this done)
<li>UV Tyson, etc. (I think not)<p>

Demos should be uploaded to the contest subdirectory on the FTP. If you mail them to me, I'll upload
them there. So if you want to keep your run secret, don't upload it before the deadline.<br>
Deadline is 23:59 CET, 31st January, 2002.<p>
