  Description :-)

  I optimized Vincent's run slightly.
  No need to take the shotgunner's gun! 
  A lower 50s would be nice.

  Note: Because Final Doom's EXE can't handle "joyb_speed 31",
        I used the original DOOM2.EXE (version 1.9). So, to get a
        correct playback of this LMP, you'll have to type:
        DOOM2 -FILE TNT.WAD -PLAYDEMO WHATEVER
