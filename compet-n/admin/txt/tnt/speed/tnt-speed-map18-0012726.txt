Description: 
I've been trying to do some 30ev attempts recently, 
I really hate the waiting section on map 18 and decided 
I'd take a closer look at the rocket jump discovered by stx-vile. 

from his 18ev-133:
"since it's a rare situation where you have to actually 
change your direction in midair with a rocket to make a jump."

While there are hardly any tricks left to discover in the iwads, 
I do my best to find easier ways to achieve them, in this case 
I have found out that it is in fact not needed to change direction midair. 

I do however change SR50 direction mid air, but that is not nearly as complicated 
as trying to change your direction.

My rocket jump setup is slower than stx-vile, so I lose some time on it, 
I gain time by taking another route. I tried to get a better time,
but the rocket jump is far from the only thing that is difficult.
Got stuck by some spectres which cost a couple of seconds unfortunately.
I also got a bit confused since I hit the switch with chaingun straight away,
wasted some time thinking I couldn't possibly have activated it so quickly.
Ran into the cyberdemon and somehow pushed him far enough so I could exit.

Overall this can obviously be improved by some seconds, 
though it's just a frustrating run.

The question is, will I include this in my next 30ev attempts?
I can get a time of about 1:15 since I start with weapons, 
which would be over a minute saved compared to 30ev-4434. 
I will at least keep it as a backup strategy if I lose time earlier on.
