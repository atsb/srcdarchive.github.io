  Description :)

  Ok, that shotgunner at the end must be the reincarnation of Dominus,
  that little bastard killed me in like 98% of my lmps here, he never
  misses!
  I got stuck on the pillar near the start *SIGH* :29 should be easy
  for some people to get here, hope u like the demo.

  Ev23gay was my attempt after about 40 minutes, where I ran OVER
  the exit...

  "I see said the blind man" NO!!! THE BLIND MAN CANNOT SEE!!!!
