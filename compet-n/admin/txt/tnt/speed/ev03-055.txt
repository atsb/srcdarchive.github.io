Bolton > This map could be done in 55s or lower

         yes it is :-) ... i forgot to hit Q
         when the pig didn't want to teleport
         (at the beginning), i lost 2-3 secs here.
 
	 Else the run went quite well... the red key 
         room could be better (the one with an archie 
         in the middle)
