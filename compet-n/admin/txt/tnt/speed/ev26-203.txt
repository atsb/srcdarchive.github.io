  Description :)

  Well first off I did a 2:10 but I didn't want to upload
  that because I got confused on the routes, so I tried to
  improve it.  Then I was getting times of 2:10 to 2:14, and
  now all of a I get 2:03.  I was lucky here that the hell
  knight didn't teleport.  Vince said this was damn hard to
  speed through but I must say I don't think it's hard at all.
  About the only difficulty is to get the red key without taking
  much damage, which I failed at by doing a stupid rocket blast
  into the wall.
