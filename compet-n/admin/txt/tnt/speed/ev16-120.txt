  Description :)

	Heya, started this right after ev32-157. 
        I followed Adam_H's advice and i improved this one
        a bit more so that (i hope) Xit won't take it back.
        As a keyboarder he'll be very limited...

	Xit > Speedruns are the mousers cats. It's no offense 
              but If you want to be a bigger threat, try the 
              mouse. It's never too late (Look at Y. Donner).
