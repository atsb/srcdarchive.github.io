  Description:

  Firstly, big THX to Slag ...he knows why. :P
  This one is my FDooM debut, so I think its
  nice to get first map now in the begining ...:P

  I´m wondering why didn´t Vinc take the chaingun too, when all
  goes well, there isn´t a second to loose, infact I didn´t
  reach the exit without it once. Biggest problem is that horde 
  of stupid brown animals upthere, getting thru them without 
  "any" delay took a lot of time. The rest is OKi, expect of blue
  doors where you have to hit your spacebar twice to open it. 
  Thats because this doors are used also as a switch to the others, 
  so when its closed, the first hit won´t open the blue ones.
  If you´re gonna hit that twice, blue doors stays closed even, coz
  the others were still open and the first hit didn´t open them,
  but the blue ones. Even so the second hit which only close the 
  blue ones back and one second is ... won´t be vulgar ..so you can 
  think that its away :P

  Anyway, this isn´t any optimum, maybe Adam/Sedlo
  could get it faster ... 27s would be unbeatable :P
