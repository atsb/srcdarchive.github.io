I wanted to incl. a 2nd version in which I kill the last spectre with the
last rocket with a time of 0:17, too. However I died on time before and 
unfortunately lost the lmp (somewhere in the deep canyons of my hd).

In this version I do *waste* the last rocket, just as a motivation for for
example Daniel, Kai Uwe or so...

Bye then

aaaah, I found it, was already moved to my CRAP dir ;-) ... so then (again)
