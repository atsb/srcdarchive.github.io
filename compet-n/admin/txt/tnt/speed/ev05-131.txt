Description:
My 4th entry total, picking easier maps since I am still new to
speed-running.

This was my 9th or 10th try on this map after watching the demo,
I try to speed past the enemies more and try not to get hung up
in the hallways, which seems to be my forte in doom. :)

A few slipups at the blue key and I could have taken the short-cut
at the yellow key, but otherwise an ok run.  The monsters were kind
enough to open the door for me after I grabbed the red key.
