Description:  

Only four seconds faster than Chris, I must say I was expecting more 
improvements here, but after got 1,28s twice, then made a perfect run 
ending like blooper.lmp (included in ev31-030.zip) I lost my poor patience
and took the first better 1,28´s ...

btw. we shouldn´t overlook this run is also an underPAR ... 7 mins :P
