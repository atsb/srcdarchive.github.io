Description:


This is my 11th ever demo so there..

This is a nice level. I like this level. I don't understand
why I have to shoot under the brain-hole, though. That
doesn't make much sense.. But, this is a rather relaxed
recording, and I'd have to say around 1:30 is possible if
you really push it. NM is tough, though. I'll try that some
time.. Well, thanks for downloading my demo!! :-b
