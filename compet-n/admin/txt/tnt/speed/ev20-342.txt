Description:	The last speed entry of "my" favourite maps. Maybe I'll
		make another one for 21 one day. Time can be improved, with
		some luck in the terminal area, the rest is fine. If you
		don't take the supercharge, the end might be more difficult,
		but even then possible. For speed reasons there is no chance to
		take plasmagun or rocket launcher
