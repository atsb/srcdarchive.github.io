Description:

This map could be done in 55s or lower, I did few mistakes here,
using armor which eats 3 seconds, but it means a biggest chance 
to get exit ... the pinkie on the stairs must leave you get thru 
.. another 2-3 secs down and finally that beginners fault -
why did I stop the move when need to switch the weapon, hehe I 
did that twice, before blue/yellow doors ...
No bigger improvements when comparing to Selims run ...ohh
I remember that telepport short-cut which saves cca 0,0000 secs :PP
