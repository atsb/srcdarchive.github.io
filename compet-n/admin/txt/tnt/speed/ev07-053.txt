  Description
 WOOO!!! I can't believe I have beaten King HA himself :)) That wasn't easy, I had dozens 55s and 54s before this one.
I still don't understand why this one is faster than the others.

  >No need to take the shotgunner's gun! 
Mmm.. I don't think avoiding him is faster:)

 >A lower 50s would be nice.
51s is possible. The 50 barrier could be beaten with luck for the last room revenant... at least I think so.
Oh, and thanks to Vincent, he knows why :)
