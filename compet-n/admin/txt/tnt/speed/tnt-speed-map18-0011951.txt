Description: 
8 second improvement over my previous run. Still room for improvement, I lost a lot of time by the last shotgunners.
In my nightmare run I go straight past without taking any damage, the same should be done for UV.
At most you will have 16-17 hp after rocket jump, so it's very difficult to get past alive.
