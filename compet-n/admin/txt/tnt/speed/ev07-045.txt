  Description :)

  This was cool to do, I decided to give CN a shot again, and decided to try a demo
  I could never do in the past, and got a 47, kept going and got a 46, then I went
  on to get a 45, tried for 44 but I'm not good enough to get that :(

  Special Thanks to Ocelot for encouragement! and *Star Wars Voice*
  A TECHNICAL READOUT OF THIS BATTLESTATION! and just overall assistance and technical
  crap.
