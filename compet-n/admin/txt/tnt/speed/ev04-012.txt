Description:
My 5th entry total, I never thought I would beat such a short time.

Don't forget the true effort behind this work, which goes to Andrew Bassett
for his time of 0:13, a piece that took +10 hours to create, beating his time
was a test of patience on my part, since I'm not used to spending a lot of
time on one map and coming out empty-handed.

It took somewhere between 2-3 hours, off and on, to get this time.  Chances
are this might be the last time this map will be improved in UV.  Funny
though, before I watched the demo, I didn't know the level was really that
short, I just didn't know exactly what needed to be done to open the exit. :)
