  Description :)

  Well from my TNT nightmare run and EVDQ I thought that Vince's
  time should be easy to beat.  It's actually quite difficult to
  survive this if you go too fast.  Time is of course improvable,
  especially since I'm sure it's possible without supercharge.
  I use a trick here that if you don't shoot on the way to the
  supercharge the pigs won't teleport.  Sometimes the pig blocks
  you or tries to go up the elevator with you.
