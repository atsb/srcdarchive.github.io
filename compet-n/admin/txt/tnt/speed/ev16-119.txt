  Description :)

  Vince's demo was hard to beat here.  I decided to use plain
  old doom2.exe because I think the last teleporter goes a bit
  faster that way.  If you play it back with final doom then it
  will desync at the very end.  In fact it will still exit as a
  1:19 but you don't see as much on the intermission screen.
  One thing you may have noticed in some speedruns on this map is
  that sometimes a monster holds the door at the start open.  This
  didn't happen here though.
