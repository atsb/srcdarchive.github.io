  Description:

	Very long level to speed through.
        The end part is very hard... especially the combination of switches
        to exit (i missed it 3 times here).
 
        Anyway i'll try to redo it if someone bothers to beat that... 
        that's my first succesfull try :)

        Beside that this map is very nicely designed and is very fun to play.
