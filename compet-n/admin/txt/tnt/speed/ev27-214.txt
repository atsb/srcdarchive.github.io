Description:	Just to have a speed entry. There is no improvement in route
		possible, plasmagun would be safer but is too far away :)
		And the next RadSuit too, you will have at most 10% when you
		it. The jump at the end would help perhaps in the Nightmare
		version of that map, but you'll need >80% health+armor then.
		It might be an improvement for the 100/100 too, but I don't
		feel like doing that map again. If everything works fine, and
		if you are a skilled strafe 50 user, maybe you can reach 2:05,
		but that will be damn hard.
