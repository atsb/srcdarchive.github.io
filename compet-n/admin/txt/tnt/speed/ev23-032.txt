     Thanks ! This level really needs luck ! Especially for the end...
     I died 9/10 just after teleporting.... because those teleporting monsters
     are a pain. And I managed to exit dead... :))

     Else that's 3s faster than Andrew... i hope this one will stand for some time
     because i've spent more time one this one than any other of my TNT speed demos.

     Is 0:30 possible ?
