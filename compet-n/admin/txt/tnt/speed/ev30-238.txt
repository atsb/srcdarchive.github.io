  Description :-)

  What an annoying last level, I just run through until I get to the end.
  It's very annoying, why does Doom have to have auto-vertical-aiming?? I
  wish it were like Quake, I could disable it... Since I start firing at the
  boss and the rockets start going down to the monsters below, who gives a
  damn about them??  How can I get a decent time like this? Ah well, I'd
  love to see a 100/100 entry for this, since as I said, I just ran
  through... faster than my fduvdemo.zip entry.
