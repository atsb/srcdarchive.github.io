Description:


This is my 7th ever demo so there..

All I have to say is that this was much like my EV03-645
demo. I didn't really know my way around the level
perfectly, and it shows. Even so, this is a very interesting
recording because it has some very tense situations. I have
come quite close to losing it all in this demo and if you're
into it, it can really be a nail-biter. Yes, when I have all
the time in the world, it adds a certain something to the
recording. It's not all rush rush, it's relax, play away and
try to live. It's a spicy, exciting demo and I'm sure anyone
should enjoy watching it. Well, that's it for now! Thanks
for downloading my demo!! :-b
