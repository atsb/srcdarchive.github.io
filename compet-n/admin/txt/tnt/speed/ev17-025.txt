===================================
Description
Slightly less ugly run. As Looper said in his textfile, Pacifist is possible but would require mountains of luck. May continue working on this later, though. First C-N entry.
Also, a faildemo is included where you can see me enter the glide and leave afterwards. That demo took around 20-30 minutes to make, and this demo came after about an hour of work at least... In between, I also had a 0:30 exit, so my frustration ran high.
