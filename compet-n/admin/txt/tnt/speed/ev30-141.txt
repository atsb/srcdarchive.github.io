Description:


This is my 17th ever demo so there..

Well gee, it's April 10th as I write this. I found this, and
I guess I just forgot to send it in!! Well, yeah.. This
level should be doable in 1:30 or so.. It takes some luck
getting those rockets in there. Pretty good.

Anyway, thanks for downloading my demo!! :-b
