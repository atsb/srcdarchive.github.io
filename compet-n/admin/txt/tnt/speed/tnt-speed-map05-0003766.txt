Description
This should be used in D2ALL UV-Speed, as it is quite easy to do (also 
the NM-Speed individual level run). Full explanation of trick is in my 
nomo demo for PRCP map 7 (which has a similar trick), but essentially, 
all that needs to be done is use of vert mouse to push slightly into the 
wall in the same way I do it in this demo, then straighten out direction 
and vert mouse exactly parallel to the wall. Eventually, you build up 
this boost, and the rest is straightforward. First exit was 0:43, but I 
wanted at least sub-40. This was a nice surprise, as my previous best 
was 0:40, and this demo went pretty smoothly. Some movement was off, and 
the first shotgun guy died in 4 shots, but overall, I'm happy with this 
run.

Also, first CNDoom demo. :D
