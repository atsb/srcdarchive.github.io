  That's cute. Start mousing dude, you kick ass but the keyboard-only -setup
  slows you down, rendering you much less competitive in cats like uv and nm
  speed.

  Hmm, a lot of minor glitches is this run. If I wasn't so darn lazy I'd go
  for further improvement. This wasn't a hardcore project for me to begin
  with tho. I just thought I'd see whether I can reach 2:15 and then decided
  I'll go for sub-2:10. It came more easily than I'd thought, that's why I
  have a bit bad conscience for quitting on this for now and uploading.
  I won't be surprised if in the near future we see a 2:05 from Hegyi.
  Or a 2:07 from Vince.
