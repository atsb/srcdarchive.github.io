  Description :)  

	At last under 2:00...
        Roughly took 1h30 to do. 
       
        The 1st part (until mancos) is easy and quite
        reproductible. The hard spots are the archie room
        (this time ok) and the switch the release teh red key.
        Usually i can run behind the manco, hit the switch 
        and then leave the room. But this time the manco 
        kept the switch so i tried to activate it by far...
        i could get it w/o being hurt !!! :)

        This run is still far from perfect... 
        so i think 1:45 would be close to the optimal here. 
        (dunno TAS time:)
