  Description :-)

  Sorry again Vincent... :)
  But this is so nice to run...
  0:43 is possible, I made it with -nomonsters.

  Note: Because Final Doom's EXE can't handle "joyb_speed 31",
        I used the original DOOM2.EXE (version 1.9). So, to get a
        correct playback of this LMP, you'll have to type:
        DOOM2 -FILE TNT.WAD -PLAYDEMO WHATEVER
