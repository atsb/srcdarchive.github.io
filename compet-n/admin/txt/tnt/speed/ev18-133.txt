We're having trouble running out
of new tricks recently, it seems.
I must say that I was very happy
to have discovered this one for
a couple of reasons.  First was
simply figuring out that the trick
was possible, since it's a rare
situation where you have to actually
change your direction in midair with
a rocket to make a jump.  Second,
I was quite pleased to see that
there was also a new route available
in this level that allowed this trick
to be used.  The rocket launcher
isn't too out of the way, and as
such, I was able to remove nearly
half a minute from the previous
record.  Unfortunately, the run is a
bit sloppy, since lately I've only
had to the patience to finish a run
with the trick, rather than smoothing
out those little hiccups in movement
and so on.  Anyway, enjoy watching
this in slow-motion. :)
