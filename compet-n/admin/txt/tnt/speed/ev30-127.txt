  [Compet-N entry #118]

  Awesome map for speedrunning, my only problem was exitroom :)

  I started playing this one yesterday evening. 
  Today - when I came from training I tried it again and I did 
  it with lot of luck one sec better than Hegyi.
  I don´t understand the "exitroom", many times I shot about 5
  rockets there and boss was still alive. 
  In this demo I shot only one rocket (I even don´t know, if I hit
  brain :)
  I wanted to try it with Archie-jump but Archie appeared just once
  in 50 tries.
  Another way to finnish this level - Adam´s end-trick (ev30-128).
  But I don´t understand how it is done, so I had to use rockets.
  Here you are. Enjoy!
  Btw.: I´m pretty sure Adam´s last record is very better than my
  sucky lucky run :P
