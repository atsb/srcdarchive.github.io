 No, i don't agree,  this map is not that hard to speed.
 My route is faster, i don't bother to wait for this sluggy lift :)
 and i don't take the BFG.

 Sorry Selim, i don't beat especially your times... i already planned 
 to find a route for this one :)

 My route should be easier on NM. But the main problem on Nm with TNT
 is the big lack of health...
