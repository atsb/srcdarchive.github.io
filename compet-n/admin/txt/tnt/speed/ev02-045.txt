  Description :)

  This is a very frustrating run.  There's lots of gunners and
  you usually get stuck on the pigs in the corridor.  I decided that
  if I shoot the barrel on the way out I can have more success getting
  past the pigs.  This takes a fraction of a second but it's well worth it.
  This demo is pretty fast except when I got stuck after the yellow key.
  It should be pretty hard to beat.
