  Description :) 

Ilya > I wanted to improve it a little bit.

       Me too :) IMO the megasphere takes too much time to get.
       I prefer to grab the SSG...

Ilya > I'd say about 1:20 or so. and i did it. 

       I though under 1:19 would do it... got 1:12 at 2nd try... nice :)
       Around 1:00 should be possible.
