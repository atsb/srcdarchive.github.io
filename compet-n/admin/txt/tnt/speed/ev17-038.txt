Description:
My second compet-n entry, an improvement from Vincent's :41.

I really liked Vincent's run here, very impressive stuff.  I skip the
megaarmor but grabbed a shotgun from the start.  The real deciding factor
is how the Archvile decides to behave once you get to the blue key.

Unlike Vincent's demo, this is obviously not a pacifist entry. :)
