  Description

Selim > WOOO!!! I can't believe I have beaten King HA himself :)) 

        Hey don't forget he did that demoe almost two years ago...
        i was starting Compet-N and he kicked my 0:57...
        I think that avoidin the shotgunners should save some time.

Selim > Oh, and thanks to Vincent, he knows why :)
 
        I had to beat your entry so that i could answer :)))
