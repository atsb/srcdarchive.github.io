  Description :-)

  Vincent was right, 0:20 is possible. Thanks to him for all the
  little tricks he implemented.

  Note: Because Final Doom's EXE can't handle "joyb_speed 31",
        I used the original DOOM2.EXE (version 1.9). So, to get a
        correct playback of this LMP, you'll have to type:
        DOOM2 -FILE TNT.WAD -PLAYDEMO WHATEVER
