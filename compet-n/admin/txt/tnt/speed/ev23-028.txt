C-N entry #6.

Description :
Gotta love running passed lots of hitscanners with no armor.
Improvable, but I'm stopping for now out of frustration.
An easy improvement would 	be if someone could do the jump while
the lift is lowering (imp might be blocking idk). I find it hard
to believe no one used this route 	before, seems a bit obvious...
