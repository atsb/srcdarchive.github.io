Description :-)

I see what you did there Altima :) But I found a way to skip that error :p
Anyway, I was intrigued with Altima's txt and I really want to sign up for
a hate TNT MAP22 list. I just could not agree more with lousy door triggers,
& no more crap..., even had better runs but I doubt I'll ever play it again.

It's good to see some competition, and mine was Altima's txt stating:
"Let me do you a favor: Stay away from this map.
Especially on NM100S and on -respawn."
You got me with that line so I had to fire up DOSBox and play. Thank you!

First exit I got 05:14 (demo included) but was not happy at all with it.
This is second time exit, so feel free to improve below 04:00.
Played without any sound so don't be harsh for my stupid mistakes.

That would be all... Cya folks!
