  Description :-)

  10th COMPET-N entry.

  One of Evilution's better maps, I suppose. The first 
  part is just like the max run, only you can skip some 
  monsters (and fighting the Barons is just a waste of 
  time). I came up with a clever trick down in the mine 
  section, by the way: by pushing down the lift to the 
  red key room, I could get a couple of free kills, since 
  often a bunch of respawned monsters would be on it. Not 
  so in this run, though. :-/

  The ending is often completely insane, with respawned 
  (and respawning) monsters everywhere. My idea was to 
  just hang around close to the exit, and use the Arch-
  Vile as help for some quick kills.

  My first exit was a 3:02, and I gradually improved 
  the time over a couple of runs, until I eventually got 
  tired of improving it further. I'm still quite pleased 
  with 2:30, though.
