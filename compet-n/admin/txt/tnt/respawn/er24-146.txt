  Description :-)

  9th COMPET-N entry.

  Why this wasn't done before is a complete mystery 
  to me. Yes, this map sucks, as does most of TNT, 
  but at least it's small and easy to play. The only 
  real challenge is getting enough kills in a fast 
  time. You pass over your steps many times, and with 
  all the respawning and infighting, with bullets and 
  rockets flying through the air, your best bet is to 
  just push through and hope for the best. I lost 
  count of how many attempts I had where I ended up 
  with 9x% kills. I counted FIVE attempts below 1:40 
  and with 98% kills (58/59). :-(
 
  Anyway, I was very relieved when, finally, I got 
  below 1:50 and with >=100% kills (this run). My 2nd 
  best try was a 1:52, where I got lost at the end, 
  while invulnerable. Sigh. I don't like this map at 
  all, and will probably not play it again -- I only 
  did this recording, so I can say that I at one time 
  held an IWAD record... :-)

  Side note -> No, I didn't have a sixth sense about 
  that shotgun guy that I managed to kill almost out 
  of view(!) early on... In most of the attempts, one 
  or two shotgun guys (and sometimes the Hell Knight, 
  ugh!) would block my way as I got to that section. 
  I made a habit of always firing there to "clear the 
  path", so to speak, but I rarely hit anything.

  Many thanks to Laszlo Vecsei for the great route 
  (I looked at his 1:44 max run of this map prior 
  to attempting this).
