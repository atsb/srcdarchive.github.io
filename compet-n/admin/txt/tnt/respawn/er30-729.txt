Description :

This map is just stupid. The only maps that are dumber than this one are Evilution
maps 08, 21, and 27. Just completely annoying maps. Even the music sucks for this one.

I don't even really see why I killed all the things I did. Oh well, at least it's
out of everyone's way now. It wasn't really difficult on -respawn, except for the
ending, which usually got hectic. I guess I managed to evade the fragfest that usually
happens when you stay with the Demonspitter for more than 1 minute. Somehow I managed
to stay on the top step unlike usual.

Ok, that's done, I don't think I'll ever feel like wanting to do this map again for
anything. It's just that stupid.
