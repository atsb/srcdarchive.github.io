Description :

Blah blah blah, I did my own record for the same map in the same style again. 14
minutes is still awful, but 5 minutes is a lot better. Could easily be under 4 minutes.

Main problems were weapon changes and the chair jump. My keyboard would do something
weird and would change my weapons back to what I was using previously. You'll see it in
the teleporting Shotgunner area, my Shotguns change from Super to Pump Shotguns...very
odd.

The chair jump was screwed up. It took 3 jumps to make it cause I always miscalculated
my angle of movement, and I wouldn't make it. Then I didn't hear the door open and I
almost missed the open door into the Shotgunners.

BTW, this run didn't take long at all, and I don't have an obscene amount of kills in
it. It's a lot better than the two I did that preceeded this one.
