Description :

Okay...a moment of honesty here. I could've SWORN that I optimized the route
for this map on -respawn with my 5:03. I kept using the old route, and my best
time was a 4:49 with 100% kills exactly....but something just suddenly hit me.

An entirely new route just came to me from nowhere....so I tried it....

Got a 3:47 on the first exit.

Then a 3:34....and now this one.

So I guess I was right in my old text file when I said it could go under 4
minutes easy...it wasn't so hard on this route....and it might even go under 3
one day ^_^

Happy holidays!
