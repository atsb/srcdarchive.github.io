  Description :)

  This wasn't that hard, except you have to be careful in the
  Blue Key room. When you face north or south towards the 
  Arachnotron's cages, tiy can easily get a visplane overflow
  from certain positions. That is, DOOM will bomb out to the
  command prompt with
   R_FindPlane: no more visplanes
 
  My first exit today was 11:11 with 130% kills. This one is
  much more lively, although I almost panicked at the very
  end when the health took a nosedive. =)
