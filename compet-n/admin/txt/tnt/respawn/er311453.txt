Description :

I just HAD to improve this, as I couldn't stand having such a horrible
run as a record, so I went back and beat my own record ^_^ Things went a
lot smoother here.

Some things of note, I still used the Megasphere early, and grabbed the
armor secret purposely at the end of the run. Luckily, the Cyberdemon was
on the pedistal that time, so I didn't have to worry about him being in
the way.

Health was just a slight problem at the end. I went into the secret exit
to get all that health and armor, but I didn't realize you couldn't get
back up there to the Shotgunners -_-' So I just decided to go on to the
exit.

Good performance by me for the most part, ending was a little hectic as
usual, but oh well, at least I lived...and this one didn't take NEARLY as
long as the first -respawn demo I did for this map.
