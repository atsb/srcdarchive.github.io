I agree, so allow me to submit something a little bit sturdier.
It's basically run and gun, but there's a cluster that likes to
build up in the central area near the start, so you have to plow
through them a few times.

This was my second exit, spent 15 minutes on it so probably an
easy map to take I'm sure. By the way, yes, that one box of
bullets was vital to finishing ;) I sure the Soulsphere and
blue armor can be skipped and still play aggressively. Probably
sub 3-minutes is possible with enough luck and skipping said
items.

Funny thing here is, it's the first time that I can recall where
music brought me to make a recording, and I was in a -respawn
mood... the music in question is "Hung Like a Pinky" by The
Orichalcon over at OverClocked Remix.
