  Description :)

  Yep, it was pretty simple to break 3:00 here.  I thought
  I would take more advantage of the BFG by using it in the
  red key room.  My first exit with that strategy was 3:24
  with 137% kills so I decided to speed it up and this is
  the result.  As you can see I was quite lucky to get 100%
