  Description :)
  
  I was inspired to do this by Altima's playthrough of TNT.
  This had given me problems in the past, and I quit trying.
  I got this fairly quickly in a one night session. I may
  consider going for nightmare secrets, but I don't think it
  will be a high priority. I think that this method with
  the berzerk secret makes it not much harder than nm speed,
  but it will be annoying to get the rocket launcher and
  related secrets.
