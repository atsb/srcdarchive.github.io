Description :

I just HAD to improve probably my worst demo I had ever done.

A -respawn for a map in 7:29 which has a Max of 2:51...isn't that just sad?

I improved it some, but not what I had expected...I couldn't help but keep thinking
back on how God-awful the 7:29 run is...of course, it was my 4th run I think.

My improvements are where I spend less time in the Arach/Revenant room and I spend
less time in that stupid hallway with the pop-up cages -_-'

The end was...well...strange. I couldn't get over the stairs to get the switch. Then
when I'm firing at the Demon Spitter, I die...and so does he. When I did this, I
thought for sure that I didn't kill him, but when I saw the stats screen I was like,
"Wha? He died?"

I had to improve the previous crap that was there...so enjoy ^_^
