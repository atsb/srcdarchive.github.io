  Description: Well, i was wandering in various compet-n dirs and found that
               there isn't a single respawn lmp of fdoom. So i made one - this
               map, unlike most of TNT's, is really cool and worth giving a
               try. DL's max is :58, will anyone bother to beat it? :)

               BTW: joyb_speed = 29 for final doom
