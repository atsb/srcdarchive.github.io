  Description: Rather small and a very nice level, thought it
	       would be a lot more fun to watch if I made it with
	       fists only...
   	       I hoped that the Imps at the end would kill at least
	       one of the Chainees but had no luck with that..
	       It's a shame there isn't more small and cool levels
	       like thisone...
