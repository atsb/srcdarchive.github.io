Description :

Kai-Uwe's 5-year old record was slow, but it was a great demo ^^

To be honest, I didn't really spend a lot of time on this to get the time
that I did. But still, I'm quite honored to beat a Kai-Uwe demo. I have a
lot of respect for the things he did for the community; he and Demonlord
both. Anyway...

This could be sped up a lot in the last leg of it, with the cages and the
windows. Had fun making this, despite the fact I still don't like this
map =)

Enjoy! ^_^
