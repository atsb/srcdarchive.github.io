  TNT: Evilution – Map 23 – UV Fast

A bit slow here, mainly due to me killing more gunners due to them being more dangerous in -fast. Missed the lift the first time, but the invuln still was going long enough to me going on the second time. This could probably be improved to something like under 5:30.
