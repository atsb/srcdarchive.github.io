 EF15-554.LMP

 Final DOOM - TNT: Evilution - MAP15 - Dead Zone
 Ultra Violence with fast monsters!

  Recorded using the Final DOOM DOOM2.EXE v1.9
  but plays back fine with the DOOM][ executable as well

  Kills       98%
  Items       65%
  Secrets    100%
  ---------------
  Time       5:54
 
  Going through the TXTs on Compet-N, one gets the impression that
  this is a well-loved level. It is all the more strange that the
  only -fast demo for it is Anthe's 8:06 entry from the 1997 GM pack.
  An aggressive approach shaves off two minutes easily, although
  there is still a lot of time wasted.

  Of course, only 98% kills are possible because a Cacodemon and a
  Pain Elemental are inaccessible behind the north-east outer wall.
  In this demo the Arch-Vile didn't manage to resurrect anything.
