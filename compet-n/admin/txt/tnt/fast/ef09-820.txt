  Description:
              You can die so fast in this level, especialy on -fast.:) You open a door and                BANG! you're dead. That's what made it so interesting for me. Except the                    strange thing I did after the blue switch(I got stuck somehow. The original                 plan was to take cover) this demo is ok with me.
