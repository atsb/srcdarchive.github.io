  Description: Nice music! Is one of the reasons why I choosed 
	       to record this level..
	       I also new it quite well after playing it at UV
	       100/100 for the Compet-n. You must have some luck
	       at the start, if you take too much damage from
	       Shotgunners, Spectres you'll most certainly
	       die when facing the 6 Chaingunners! 
	       Very easy to run out of bullets when killing 
	       Skulls, Demons..
	       Revenents are very easy in -fast mode when you can
	       block their shots with for example a corner, in
	       open areas they are very dangerous..
