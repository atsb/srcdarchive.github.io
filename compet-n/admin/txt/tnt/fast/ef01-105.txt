Description:
                Hmm, a half point maybe will. A nice was shattering troopers
                and imps at the begin of this level.

2 Vincent C. -> It wasn't easy to beat your good record, but your run had
                some small bugs, which I fixed and added some improvements.

2 ALL ->        btw. "joyb_speed 31" hasn't any effect in F.doom
                but I tried to use "keyb_speed 31". Is this allowed? The
                lmpc reported no problem. The visual and speed effect is
                as same as autorun with "joyb_speed 31" in any versions of
                DooM. Check it out, Adam!  :-)
