A bit of an improvement over Xit's run. A bit more daredevil-like at
times and less cautious, even though I tend to miss more shots. I also
skipped some ammo that I didn't need and I also didn't double-check for
the teleporting enemies at the end. Losing rockets cost me some time
with the arch-vile, but still a decent run overall.
