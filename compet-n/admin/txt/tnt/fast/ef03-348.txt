===================================

Almost every part of this map is luck-based, especially when going for the fastest time on
this one. Sometimes, the Spectres would even drag you to the wrong teleporter in the wrong
moments, or even worse, get surrounded by them if you are not quick or alert enough.

Tried to do something different from what Radek had from his previous run.

There are two ways to kill the Spectre in the starting area: either by telefrag or by
dragging it in a crossfire at the starting area, and I did brought it to the latter instead
of a warp kill.

Tried somethind different on the outer area by picking up the SSG first, then dashing my 
way towards the red key then gone back to take cover at the secret area for a bit before 
heading for the red key area.

Also had to do a bit of efficiency by not picking up the Blurspheres so as not likely to
misdodge on the enemies' attacks.

Also managed to save a few rockets just for the yellow key entrance to take out a couple of
zombies & imps grouped together & on the last Revenant at the exit.
