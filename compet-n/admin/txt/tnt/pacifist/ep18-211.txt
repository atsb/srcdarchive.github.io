  Description :)

  Hey hey, only 4 seconds slower than my speed record.  I use a
  method for the ending room which was used by Stx-Vile in his
  movies, and by Adolf's last run, so I guess that can account
  for about 3 seconds.  Combining the PE trick with good running
  in a pacifist run would be quite a challenge.
