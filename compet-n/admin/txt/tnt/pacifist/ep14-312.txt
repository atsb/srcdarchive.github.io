  Description :)
  
  Well, this didn't turn out to be too difficult. I survived that
  lift (the one after the skulls on the way back) 3 times. The first
  time I had good health and tried the quick route, but the chainer
  started shooting before there was room to pass him. The second time
  I had low health and tried the long route, but was blocked by some
  wimps. This demo is the third time.
