Description:

This can be extremely annoying because the chaingun dudes
will start attacking you and will continue until someone
else attacks it, and demons are too stupid to catch a
chaingun dude quickly enough to save your ass.  It starts
out hard and gets easier as you go on, so once you kill
all the humans you can relax and let the other monsters
kill eachother.
