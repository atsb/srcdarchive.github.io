Description:
This is my first entry for compet-n. 
I really like Evilution only no this map (too long way to the goat's head). I discovered second exit jump back in early 2000. Recently I looked for DooM tricks in compet-n and 3darchives FTPs and decided make a demo and send it. 
No doubts it's definitely poor time. But if the boss shots arch sooner... 
And a foolish pink demon. I have no intention to telefrag him but he was so awkward. 
May be I try to improve this one. In any case a player with though moderate skill can improve the time. It need only some patience waiting until a vile will appear.
