  Description :)

  I use a new route to beat Adam Hegyi's record.  It's actually
  faster to lure the imps backwards where there's more room in 
  the corridor than to lure them forwards around the corner.  I
  first did 19, then with work I was able to improve it to 18 and
  now 17.  I think 16 should be possible.
