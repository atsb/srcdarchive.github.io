Description :

WOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

Unfortunately.....you have to wait and be EXTREMELY lucky with the
Spider Mastermind and the Cacodemons. stx-Vile and I thought it
might be possible to perform a Red Key grab through the mastermind,
but neither of us could perform it. So you basically have to wait
until the spider dies to pick it up.

I had so many attempts end at the Mastermind. >.< Not necessarily by
being shot to death...sometimes I'll get the freeze to work, but you
gotta get lucky and hope that no monster wanders behind you and
traps you. The Red Key is definately the most dangerous spot in
this entire run, hands down. Just...anything can happen there. >.<

Because the Cacodemon goes back to sleep, I lose around 15 - 30
seconds in this attempt. So under 5 minutes is possible... ^^'

I grab the soulsphere, but that is completely optional. I just
figured that some extra health would be nice ;)

The Yellow Key area is a little hectic. The strategy used actually
goes back to a discussion between...I think Williamson, Hegyi, and I,
about Sedlo's pl12-006 demo, whether it was also a pacifist or not.
It was eventually ruled that because you can wake the Pain Elemental
up, you can avoid the telefrag. And here, on this map, if you don't
wake anything up (or even if you DO wake something) you're basically
going to telefrag something. I'd guess that waking them up would
count as an unintentiona telefrag however. So...I wake them up.
Vile had a 6:14 but we both assumed that it was invalid, as there
were monsters placed on the teleporter. However, I did a test run
through of the map to the Yellow Key, and didn't fire a shot at all.
I still telefragged something.... -_-' Waking them up has the same
result...

I'm assuming this is a successful pacifist, unless Hegyi says
otherwise ^_^
