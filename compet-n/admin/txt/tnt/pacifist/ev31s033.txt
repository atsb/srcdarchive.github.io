  Well, this is slightly easier than the normal exit,
  I think about 0.3 seconds easier (so this 33.94 would
  be only about 30.24 to the normal exit).
  One slight mistake I had when jumping off the chair,
  but I was happy to afford that after getting that
  0:29 for the normal exit.
  Pacifist run and no strafe50 either here...
