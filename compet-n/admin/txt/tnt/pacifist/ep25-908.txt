  Description :)
  
  A frustrating run indeed. You really need luck to pass all
  those shotgunners and skulls, and after that I found quite
  a few ways fail at the rest of the demo. There's a funny
  infight in this demo--I like to use the barons to blow up
  some barrels and they more often than not get angry at
  eachother in the process.
