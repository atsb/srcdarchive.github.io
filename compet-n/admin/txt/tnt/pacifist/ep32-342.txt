C-N entry #186.

Yay another undone done. :)

I'm very happy with the way this
one turned out.  The tricky areas
near the midpoint worked out great
and I was able to take more risks
because I was a bit more healthy
than usual.  I'm also happy to have
finished this time... got overzealous
before and tried to exit when the
cyber wasn't thoroughly distracted.
Rocket = Cyberdemon 1, me 0.
