C-N entry #185.

Took a break from attempting tn09
(which I'm now convinced is quite
possible, though still very hard)
to give this a try.  This was my
first attempt making it past the
red key area so expect a little
slop to mesh with the play here.
The yellow key area had me stumped
for a minute or so because of the
bunched up monsters, so watching
that part will be boring.  After
that it's just like the speedrun.
Feel free to try the archvile jump
in this run, I didn't bother in this
first success. :)
