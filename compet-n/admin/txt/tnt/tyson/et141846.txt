  Pretty easy.  The only hard part would be the pain
  elemental punchout/shootout, depending on whether you want
  the ammo.  Other than that it is easy to save enough ammo
  for the spiderdemon.  I always punch out the pigs and the
  pain elemental, and use the chainsaw where it is logical.
  Once again I tried this without knowing how to get the blue
  sphere getting 98 or 99% kills.  You think I would have
  learned after my experience with tnt07 and tnt05.
