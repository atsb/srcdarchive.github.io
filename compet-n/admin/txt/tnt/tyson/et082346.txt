  Description :)

  I think I played this one way too conservatively.  I realized
  this near the end and shot more monsters instead of forcing
  them to fight eachother.  In the end I chainsawed a spider,
  even though there was enough ammo way back in the level,
  because I had enough health to take the risk.
