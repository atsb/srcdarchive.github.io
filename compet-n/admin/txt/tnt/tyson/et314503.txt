  Description :)

  I had always believed this to be possible, but I guess
  I never really got around to doing this. I think I might
  have been leaving it for Altima, who expressed an interest
  in this map. As for the map, well it definitely has a
  plutonia feel with those arch-viles and pain elementals.
  The red key stairs are a dead giveaway that it was done
  by one of the Casali brothers. There's quite a lot of
  bullets on the map, so it is manageable. In this demo
  you can see that I didn't really know what I was doing for
  the later parts. Thank goodness for that teleporter near
  the exit or else I would have had to restart. Also, I had
  forgotten about those pigs that are released by a secret
  switch. If I had completed the map without them I would
  have been disappointed that the demo was not complete.
