  Description :)

  I've been trying this for a few days now.  It's not terribly
  difficult, but I've managed to screw up in many different ways.
  This demo is a bit slow, partly because that cyberdemon teleported
  around a bit and I had to spend some time trying to find it.  Mostly
  this demo is so long because it's a huge level with lots of big
  monsters.
