  Description :)

  There's a lot of monsters by the yellow key which need to be
  shot so there's not much bullets for the rest of the map.
  Fortunately there's enough health and the monsters aren't too
  difficult so it's only moderately difficult.  In this demo my
  goal was to save all the bullets for the yellow key area which
  I was able to do.
