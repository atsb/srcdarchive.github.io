Yesh, I felt like
putting up with dosbox
again. Because there's
so much honor in dealing
with rocketscience of
setting it up, distorted
spinning at startup, 
ocassional freezing up of 
a frame or two and so on.
Map sucks for this category,
demo sucks partly because
there's pretty much nothing
exciting happenning and on
top of all that I sucked 
at playing it, although 
it's still almost twice as 
fast as previous tablefiller. 
I even left with a truckload 
of bullets. Blah.
