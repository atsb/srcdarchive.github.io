  Description :)

  This map was hard but not to an extreme.  Well, tyson maps never
  seem that hard if you are able to finish them.  There is an arch-vile
  in this map which in fact revived several monsters so the kill count
  was over 100%.  I didn't check that all monsters are dead but I can't
  believe that there was anything that I forgot.
