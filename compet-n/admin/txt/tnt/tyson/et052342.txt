  Some baron punching and some imp punching in small
  corridors.  I would say this is like any of the other
  tnt tyson challenges I have done in that it is time
  consuming and with practice is not too difficult.
  The last time I recorded this I got 98% kills because
  I didn't know about the rocket launcher.  This also
  happened on map07.
