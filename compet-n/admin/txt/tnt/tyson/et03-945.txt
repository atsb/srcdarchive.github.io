  Description :)

  I didn't find this too difficult to beat.  It takes some
  practice to learn how to deal with all those shooting
  people.  I used mostly bullets for them, and ran out near
  the end so I had to wait until the invisibility ran out
  to finish punching those mancubii.  I'm sure this could go
  quite a bit faster, but it is a difficult one to do fast.
