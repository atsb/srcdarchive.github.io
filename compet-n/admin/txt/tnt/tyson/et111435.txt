  Description :)

  Last time I tried this I didn't know about that shotgun
  dude near the megasphere, so it was disqualified.  Here
  I use an arch-vile jump to get the megasphere.  The
  trick is not new.  I read about it on a website somewhere.
  This plays back with 0 monsters alive at the end of the
  level using timer.exe so I won't worry about Adam telling
  me about some hidden monster.
