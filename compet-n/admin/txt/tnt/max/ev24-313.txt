Description: Like taking candy from a baby. 1:05 faster then Peo's time (4:18).
             First successful run was 4:38. Then I got a 4:09 followed by a 4:07. This
             continued on until I decided this time was good.

	     I am a little dissappointed that Peo's record still existed. After watching
	     his demo I knew it would be easy to beat his record. This is not to 
             knock Peo. Many thanks should go to Peo, Kai, and Demonlord for developing
             a lot of demos (and routes) to fill in the tables. Why is it that a 
	     December 96 mediocre run still exists? Probably because in 1996 the c-n
	     crew decided it wanted to expand it's operations to Plutonia but was
	     "obligated" to take Evilution as part of the deal. I agree with a recent
	     comment by John Keniry, "Its a pity the best players favour Plutonia so 
             much because there are plenty of good maps in TNT, ..." Yeah John, I 
             couldn't agree more.
