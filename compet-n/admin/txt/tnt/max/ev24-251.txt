Description: 22 seconds faster then my previous run of 3:13. Now that this demo
             is under 3 minutes I am pretty happy with it. I am pretty sure that
 	     any possible improvements couldn't be that signifigant (more then
             10 seconds) so I think I'll leave this record as is for a while.
