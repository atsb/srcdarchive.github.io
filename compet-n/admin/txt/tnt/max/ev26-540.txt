Description:  It's a classic game, that. Ballistyx, I mean.

              Well, this is under 6 min like Kai wanted. Nearly everything
              went well, except for the blasted imp teleporting in from
              who knows where, losing at least ten seconds there. I SSG
              the spectres at the start - you've got just enough ammo,
              and it saved heaps of time. Everything else is Kai's route,
              except for the rockets used on the revenants at the end.
              I was running out of shells at that point, had to do something.
              This led to a very strange situation, where I apparently
              killed, or nearly killed, one revenant with one rocket.
              At least, both revenants went down with two rocket, and
              one didn't seem to take much, if any, area damage from the
              first rocket. It must have, though, cause even at max
              damage a rocket can't take down a revenant like one SSG
              blast can (thanks George Bell's Weapons Damage info).
              Must have come close though...
