             Actually, I'm quite happy to improve my times, if someone's
             come along and done them better :)

             >but, can you get lower??

             You'll know the answer by now :)

             Anyway, pay attention everybody: new route. Got this from
             watching the speedruns. Saves about 10-15 seconds. I'm
             happy with the time, but the demo gets very messy in
             parts. Chaingun on revenant: aargh! I had a 6:31 which looked
             much better but this is below 6:30. I don't know how easy/hard
             it'll be to get below six minutes, because there's a lot of
             running to do in this level.
