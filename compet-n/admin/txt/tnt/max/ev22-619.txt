Description: A healthy 2:19 faster then my previous time! A good story behind it too...

	     This time I employed new tactics:
	     1) I skipped the first green armor down the long pathway
	     2) I also realized that it would be much faster to attack the barons 
		with the bfg. It would be essential to leave with two bfg shots
		left - one for the archie at blue key door and one at the end.
  	     3) SSG the invis demons not beserk them.

	     Using these strategies I was able to obtain average times of around
	     7:15 - 7:30. On one run I managed to get a 7:01 with 100/100%. The
	     catch was - I got 100% kills only because the archie revived an enemy
 	     and as I exited I missed killing a demon with my super shotgun while
	     running into the exit. Unsure if the demo was valid I asked both Adam
	     Williamson and Heygi if it was - however, as I thought, it wasn't. I 
	     was determined to get it under 7 minutes anyways. I added another
	     tactic to my repoire: 

	     4) I stopped the practice of heading down the hallways once to clear
		them out and passing my way thru them a second time on my way back
		to heading to the exit. Basically I streamlined it so I only went
		down a path once.

	     After about 5 runs I managed a 6:45 with 99% kills. The successful runs
	     thereafter were very dissapointing - either I would get 99% kills or a
	     time like 7:00. On this run I was amazed at how much lower the time was.
	     It had come right after I ran exactly seven minutes flat. One of the 
	     main differences is that I managed to kill all the barons and spare three
	     bfg shots.

	     BTW, if you are wondering why sometimes I spend a few seconds too long in
	     the dark areas it's because I play with no sound. That's right, not one
	     freaking SFX. It's because window fucks up my mouse sensitivity with DOOM
	     so I play in DOS...except I can't get my Soundblaster Live to work in DOS.
