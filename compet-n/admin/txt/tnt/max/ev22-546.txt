Description: 33 seconds faster then my previous record. I take another new 
	     approach at the beginning. This time I get the ssg immediately
	     and catch the lift back up. This makes the bfg and blue key 
	     area much easier to finish quicker.

	     I clocked my exact time as 5:46.00 so I guess this demo can be
	     improved by at least one more second. ;-) Under 5 minutes is 
	     very likely with better weapon handling (esp. BFG) and using 
	     wall-running in those long hallways. Perhaps I'd suggest a 
	     few small changes to the route also.

	     I've been trying two new improvements. I've tried to save cell
	     ammo from the blue key battle so that I would have 4 bfg shots.
	     This allows me to bfg the demons in one shot. I've also tried 
	     to delay the bfg lift by interfering with it reaching the top
	     and then riding it back up. It saves time but it's hard for me
             to do. Neither of these tactics are in this demo but I'm trying
	     to get it together.
