Description: 

This was never intended as a COMPET-N demo. A couple of years ago I'd
intended to make a complete TNT Maxkills collection. I got as far as
map22 and just couldn't be bothered to find my way around those mazes.
Anyway this demo is from that aborted project.

Its a fun map to play and I'm suprised the record hasn't already been improved.
