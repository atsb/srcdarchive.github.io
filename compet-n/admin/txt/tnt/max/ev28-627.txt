  Description :-)

  A beautiful map, wonderful hellish-style... I had some nice parts like
  killing all revenants from above quickly, but some not so nice parts like
  firing a rocket in my face while trying to kill a revenant and get away
  from a rocket at the same time, I guess the revenant rocket would have
  hurt less ;-)

  In the end I tried to make the mancubus fight the revenants and it worked,
  or maybe the area damage from my rockets hurt him... And then the
  arachnotron died from two rockets, maybe he sympathized with me, since I
  got some damage from those rockets as well? ;-)
