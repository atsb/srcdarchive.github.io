Description: Yonatan's original 1:08 was hard to beat.
             Something for the /miscs: An I-am-the-greatest-berserker
             (Demonlord excluded; berserk a Cyberdemon, what a silly
             decision :), where all these monsters (except for the pig)
             splash (I like that TSSLOP sound), with or without other
             weapons, only your final hit must be a berserk, that's
             clear. Perhaps without the chaingunners too, to make it
             easier.
             Only an initial entry, hope there will be improvements. But
             this time it isn't as easy as all the other initial ones :)
