Description: Another ok map. Looks pretty good at first, but then comes the
	     caves and stuff and they've been way over-used. The gameplay 
	     mostly sucks, but it's pretty much in places where you won't face
	     monsters. The time i got isn't that good, so i guess it could be
	     cut down to 5:10 or maybe even below 5 minutes... who knows.
