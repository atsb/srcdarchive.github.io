Description: Ok, just another of these boring ( :-) maps. There is enough health
	     lying around that you don't need to hide much. You have to have
	     some luck at the crushers, sometimes you waste a lot of time there.
	     It's pure chaingunning, I can tell you. For those who like to kill
	     many many monsters with that weapon. More difficult is to make as
	     much of that maps as possible with the chainsaw :) or berserk
	     (idbeholds). This map will be hard in -fast and Nightmare, there
	     are so many "shooters".
