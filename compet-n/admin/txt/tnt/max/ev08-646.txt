Description: It's levels like this that makes TNT: Evilution look bad. By looks
	     this is one step back from Doom2: Hell On Earth, but, believe it
	     or not, heeeeere i coooome, just kidding, it's actually fun to
	     play. There should've been a couple more stimpacks, you lose
	     health pretty quickly with all those Chaingunners and almost no
	     armor... Decent demo, but i don't feel like playing this map 
	     anymore...
