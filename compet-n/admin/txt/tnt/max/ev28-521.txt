Description: What the heck? I don't understand the time: I'm usually around
             6:00 and all sorts of unplanned things happened here. I don't
             understand how I could have so much ammo at the end... I
             usually run out. 100 cells at the exit is surely not optimal :)

             I agree with Yonatan - great level.
