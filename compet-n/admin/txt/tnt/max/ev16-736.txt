Description: 

Its a pity the best players favour Plutonia so much because there are plenty
of good maps in TNT, and this is one of them. 

My recollection (because I recorded this a long time ago) is that I enjoyed
playing this a lot. As usual I have a health crisis in the middle of the
demo and have to play a little conservatively for a few seconds.
