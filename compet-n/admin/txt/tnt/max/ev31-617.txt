  Description :)

  This map is tricky to find a good method to get a fast time
  with.  I think one of the annoying parts is those spectres.
  It's very hard to see them.  Also, the big area with mancos
  cacos and spiders is tough too.  I wanted to make this one
  pretty good, but because of the nature of the map there's
  still room to improve it by making a more polished demo.
