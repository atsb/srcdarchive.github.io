  Description : 15 seconds faster then my previous. Time is not really important
		to me anyways here. I was trying to get my reflexes in shape since
		it has been a while. I was also trying some new approaches. 

		I missed killing the 3 chaingunners hiding behind the computer panel
		in one go (which cost me 4 seconds) and somehow managed to need 4 ssg
		shots to kill a revenant. I've never on any run (even practice runs) 
		taken more then 2 ssg shots to kill the revenant hiding in those crates.
		I amaze myself continously with the fact that I find a new way to
		screw up good runs. Otherwise, the enemies seemed to teleport in a
		bit slower then normal.
