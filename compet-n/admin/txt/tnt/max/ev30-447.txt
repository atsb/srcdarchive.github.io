Description: 

I checked the compet-n records sheet for this map and found no maxkills entry
so I made this. Later on I saw that there was a lmp in the max directory
"ev30-238.zip". 

I couldn't beleive the time. I know this lmp is beatable but by over two
minutes??

When I had a look I found it wasn't a real maxkills lmp. Here's what Yonatan

Ok, its been a long time coming but here 'tis.

The start is nice with the colour coded blocks but I prefer a map30 to have
less preamble than this - you know collect the weapons and head for the
main room. Maybe thats why other people just play this for speed?
