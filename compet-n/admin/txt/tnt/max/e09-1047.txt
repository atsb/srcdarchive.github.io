Description: There is not enough ammo. to use chaingun all the time.
             But shotgun is useful too. Many places to hide, if you
             are a coward (or want to reach the exit). There are many
             chaingunners and seargents, but usually you are faster
             than they are, or you can take a breath while they kill
             each other.
             Only an initial entry, hope there will be improvements.
             Under 10:00 !
