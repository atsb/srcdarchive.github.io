Description: Only my second "fast" attempt where I reached the exit. The Cybie
	     fighting some monsters is a side-effect. I only wanted to get to
	     the Supershotgun. And If I am there, I can take the Invulnerable,
	     can't I? And the only useful place for it is to fight the Cyber-
	     demon. Ok, there is a berserk in that map, and Demonlord showed
	     us that you need no other weapon to kill a Cyberdemon, but it costs
	     a little time. BTW, there is no Plasmagun nor BFG in that level
	     and there are to small places near the megaarmor you can't reach!
