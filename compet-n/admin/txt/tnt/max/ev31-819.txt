Description :

Today is my birthday, so I thought I'd treat myself with an upload for this map. ^_^

This time came to me as a surprise somewhat, I didn't think I'd shave this much time
off of my 8:53. I think it came from 2 things:

1.) The Pain Elementals didn't leave behind any Lost Souls to clean up that would
get in the way later

2.) I started releasing everything in the Red Key room sooner

This is probably my favorite map to play Max-Kill on, it's just a lot of fun for me.

I kinda ran out of rockets in the Red Key room so I had to finish everything off
with plasma...and the Cyber, once again, wasn't on his pedistal...so the Cyberdemon
fight was smooth again ^_^

Enjoy!
