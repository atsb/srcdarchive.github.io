Description: Well, this is a nice map, altough it has some annoying parts. Like
	     those tunnels with those Imps, plus it's too dark certain places.
	     The end can be pretty hard, with all those Lost Soul's and 
	     everything, also it's easy leaving monsters behind. I got a 9:17
	     but left one Chaingunner/Revenant in the red key area. It's
	     actually medium sized, this map, even though it seems much bigger,
	     like map20. It could probably go below 9 minutes. There's a jump
	     in the end i didn't make, could save 5-6 seconds only there, so...
