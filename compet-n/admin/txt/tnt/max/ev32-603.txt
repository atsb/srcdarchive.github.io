Description: Okay, now I'm happy. There a few route changes in this demo:
             since I've got so many rockets going this way, why not blow up
             revenants/soldiers/demons with them? And I run through the
             barrels in the slime maze.  The time's getting pretty close
             to the TAS time now: only 36 seconds behind.  It might
             be beatble if everything goes perfect. Without the
             missed shots in the slime maze, this would have gotten below
             6 minutes.

             Your turn, Anthony...
