===================================

Demo played back with cndoom v2.0.3.2 to get the exact time.

2nd Compet-N gold get!

Never knew I could do this as well on the original executable, but my fingers had  hurt a bit from
holding down the 'Run' button. :P

A second of improvement from what I have done from my CN-Doom demo, had to  do  the  same strategy
involving rounding-up the Pain Elementals, Revenants and Arachnotrons with a bit of luck involving
damage count because it is often that you would notice that PEs would summon Lost Souls and get in
the way but managed to sweep it out. A bit of close calls going around here and there, but grabbed
the red key safe and sound.

Also managed to have enough cell ammo left to use for the Plasmagun just to  sweep  the  remaining
monsters at the yellow and red key rooms. Got lucky that I managed to use my plasma ammo  for  the
baron as it is the monster that consumes the most time to be killed with the  Super  Shotgun  as I 
left the map with 8% health photo-finish.

Previous record is from Radek Pecka with a time of 2:39.
