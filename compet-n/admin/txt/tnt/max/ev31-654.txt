Description:

2 years with the COMPET-N... go me ^-^ Thanks for the fun, all of ya.

Anyway, this demo is ugly...but as far as the route goes, I think it's
pretty much optimal. The changes I made are leaving the Arachnotrons
alive and coming back for them later, and also releasing the shotgunners
much earlier. Also sped things up at the Red Key area outside.

The first set of Arch-Viles fried me...dunno how they got me, must've
been waiting for me to step around that corner... =P

Anyway, this is the only exit I had out of probably...200 tries or so that
was below 7 minutes, which is what I was aiming for. This might also be
the last demo I do for this map, depending on if someone beats it or not.
I definately won't be touching my own record, unless I get some unreal
time out of nowhere... ;) I'm not Sedlo or Ocelot, so don't expect THAT
one =P

Overall, this demo is ugly, but incredibly fast with some very lucky shots
(listen to the Revenant and you'll see what I mean...)

Enjoy =)
