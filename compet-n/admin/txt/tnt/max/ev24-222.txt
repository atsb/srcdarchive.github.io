Description: 

John Keniry has decided to mess with the wrong c-n player. I will defend my points
vigorously on my way to the top. I'll give him credit for the better route but his runs
have quite a few mistakes. Why does he always delay at the beginning of a demo? Why
doesn't he bring down lifts first and then get health/fight enemies? And what was up
with that horrible exit he had where he lost nearly 2 seconds? 

The time improvement is obviously insignifigant but I wanted a swift response. Plus
I'm working on other TNT max records. John has already gotten onto my shit-list when
he defeated my first TNT record for points (ev03) before I uploaded it. I let that one
slide, but that's the last...
