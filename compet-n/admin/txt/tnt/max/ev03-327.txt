Well that was too much of a temptation, and I didn't want to lose the record
after only one month. I had another look at the route and my previous demo
and saw how much time I wasted because I wasn't clear in my mind where the 
next door was. This is a much tighter effort but there is still some slack.

2:59 anyone ?
