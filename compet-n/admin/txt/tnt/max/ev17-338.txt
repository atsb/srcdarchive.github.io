Description: Well, Demonlord's demo was very good, but beating his time
             wasn't half the trouble. The problem is killing all the enemies.
             I got a 3:34 with an imp going walkabout by the SSG, and a
             3:30 when not all the monsters teleported in. 

             Btw, I think this was Demonlord's last TNT max point, and
             last max point anywhere on COMPET-N. Too bad really, because
             he really was the first Doom God. His lmps were among the first
             I ever saw, and I was mesmerised by his skill and guts...
             That man could play.
