Description: Somebody tell me why when Radek decides to do a handful of EV 
	     demos with improvements as little as 2 seconds (three of them
	     beating Chris's records) and I do one substantial improvement
	     of 1:05 and Chris decides to retaliate on me? Hehehe...

	     I can't believe you were happy w/ 3 seconds over 6 minutes. 
	     That's just begging to be put under 6. :-)

	     18 seconds faster...only 18 seconds left to beat the TAS time
	     (I haven't seen it yet). I could have been so happy with this 
	     demo and finished with this map if it wasn't for the "close 
	     your eyes" ending. The final battle went great and then I 
	     botch reaching that stupid exit. That, and the fact that I
	     over ran the last switch before the exit cost me about eight
	     seconds.

	     Most of Chris's new ideas I already had anticipated before I
	     saw them. The demo was ten days old when I uploaded it so I
	     already had some new strategies. If Chris can get a meaty
	     improvement (10 seconds or more) I'll lay off. Sure, there 
	     is under 5:30 and beating the TAS record but ... nah.

	     BTW, I enjoy these demo-driven dialogues Chris. Hmm, which
	     Ratcliff demo should I pick on next??? :-))
