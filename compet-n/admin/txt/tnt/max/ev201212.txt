Description: I'm quite satisfied with it. Only thing that went wrong was
	     the BFG in the acid pool, because at least the Caco and some of
	     the Imps there hadn't teleported. The rest is usual cell wasting.
	     Less mistakes and it would be a time under 12 minutes. This level
	     is too big to be one of my favourite, and I don't like to wait
	     for monsters teleporting somewhere. I like the "linear" style.
