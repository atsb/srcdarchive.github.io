But I used a faster route :-).

I think there is still a faster variation for this map if the player takes the
*left* fork up the stairs to the main arena, like Anthony Soto did in his
ev-251.lmp. I tried that but died too easily. As it is the route I used is
already very dangerous and at this speed feels a little like nitemare.

Oh I included an extra lmp, only 46 seconds, demonstrating a bug which allows
you to reach the exit without getting the blue key. Hope Adam doesn't mind.
