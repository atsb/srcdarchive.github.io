Description: Ok, it's a large level, and there is a lack of ammo, if
             you don't use chainsaw at the beginning. Sometimes you
             have to saw on Cacos - it works, so anyone cares? If you
             miss often, then this level is not yours. I like it.
             Except for that once-teleporter.
             Only an initial entry, hope there will be improvements.
             Less than 10:00 ??? Hope so !
