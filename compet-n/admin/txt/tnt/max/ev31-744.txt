Description :
             The Cyberdemon here killed me three times in a row.:((( That's what I get by                not playing Doom for a week:) My hands were terribly shaking so my movement                 was not what I wanted but when I look at this demo as a whole I'm satisfied                 with it. The only part I really don't like in this map is the yellow key area.              I'm completely lost there. Reminds me of the labyrinth in Memento Mori map 7.
