Description:  Hahaha, This rules!! This is the funniest demo I have recorded in recent
	      memory. And it just so happens to be my first "official" Compet-n record.
	      After a demo-running affair with tnt22 max I needed to pick a fresh map
	      to work on. Looking at Peo's ev03-434 lmp I knew that this record was in 
	      my grasp. Peo didn't have the most spectacular run wasting a lot of ammo.

	      It only took me two successful runs in fact to achieve this record. My 
	      first time was ~ 5:24. Actually, my biggest problem was just getting thru
 	      the map. I'm sure I had at least ~ 30 runs where I died in the central 
	      area (The outside area w/ the snipe areas). The funniest aspect of this 
	      demo in that I get slammed by an archie and I am left with 1% health. I
	      end up battling mancubi and revenant's with 1% to the exit. In fact, before
	      I encountered the final battle I was pretty sure my time was around 5 mins
	      because my run had quite a few problems itself (COUGH health COUGH). All in
	      all this was sweet irony and justice! :-))
