Description: All right, time to strike back. This is all Anthony's route,
             except I release the mancubus/revenant horde a little earlier.
             They usually end up killing the hell knights, which saves
             at least 6 SSG shots (about nine seconds). Hey, that's the
             time saving I've got here...
