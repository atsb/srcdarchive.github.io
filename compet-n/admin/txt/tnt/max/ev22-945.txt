Description: Kai-Uwe said in ev21 max that it was the worst map in evolution. 
	     I'd have to disagree with him. Did he ever get to map22? God 
	     awful texturing complements a horrible layout. 70% of the level
             is one big maze. And I don't see how anyone could find some of 
	     these secrets even using a map editor. This run is my second successful
	     run through this map. My first time was 13:41 but I knew I could get
	     the time under 12 minutes. I didn't realize I could improve it by almost
	     4 minutes (3:56)! Needless to say I'm pretty happy. 

	     Ahhh, the crap your forced to play for your first compet-n entry. ;)

	     Recorded on September 26, 2000. Thanks to Henning Skogsto for encouragement
	     and Waldon for helping me to learn the mouse.
