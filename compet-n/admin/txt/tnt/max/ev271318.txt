Description: I don't like that map, but in normal Ultraviolence it is way
	     easier than with fast monsters. That's why time is better :)
	     I know I don't have to kill Lost Souls, but the exit is maybe
	     the only difficult part of that map, and I really need some
	     space to retire there. There are some things you have to pay
	     attention for: at the Invulnerable, run to the 4th (?) stair
	     early, or you'll have to wait for 3 chaingunner there later.
	     And you should take the red key torelease all monsters. The
	     other trick is to release the spiders at the blue key and hope
	     they help you with the Imps. Take care for the Sergeants there!
	     I would estimate that I can finish that map in maybe 11:00 if I
	     knew I had no problems with the Lost Souls. Btw, I was fairly
	     surprised that the Mancubus hadn't teleported...
