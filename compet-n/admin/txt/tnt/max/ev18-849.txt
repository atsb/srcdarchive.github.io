Description: Another nice map, with good playability. Fun to play, although
	     it gets damn annoying some times, especially in the red-key area.
	     The time could be improved a bit, maybe even below 8 minutes...            	     
	     I didn't handle the first Pain Elementals too great, nor the
	     Arachnotrons, or the last part... but oh well...:)
