  Description:

Sorry for the shitty little improvement, but this map's really getting to me.
3 1:52s (one with 3 shots on the last revenant), 2 1:53s, a 1:54...arg. First
time i've ever not screwed up the invuln room. The rocket shot in that room
helps a lot with the jump - it never fails for me now.
