   ...and Time  4:30
               ------


Description: Time on this map is really based on the time the monsters spend
	     on teleporting. And i hate these kinda maps, but somehow this one
	     isn't all that bad. It might seem cheap improving a demo only
	     with a few seconds, but who cares about your opinion anyway.
	     Update: I tried to come up with a better time, but after a while
	     i got tired of getting either 99% kills, or hearing some fag 
	     wandering around when i was heading towards the exit.
