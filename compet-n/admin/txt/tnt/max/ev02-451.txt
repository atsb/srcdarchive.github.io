Description: And another '97 TNT demo bites the dust...

             This is hard when you're going fast, with lots of shot-firing
             enemies, little health and none of the big weapons. My strategy
             was to kill the chaingunners first, shotgunners second, troopers
             third, and then leave everything else unless I have to. Later on
             strange things happened and I got lost, so ten seconds can be
             made up easily. 4:30 will be harder.
