Description: I don't know what the crushers are for. Be careful not
             to forget the Supercharge. Nice level, only problem is
             that you have to run a way twice. And you don't get to
             know what the yellow button is for (or was it the blue
             key? :). The slime is easy... who balances on the edge
             if there is a radiation suit ? Could have left without
             killing the archvile, but I felt like I had to do that.
             Only an initial entry, hope there will be improvements.
