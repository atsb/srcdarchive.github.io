Description: The start is tough and nice (heh, you may use chainsaw, if you
	     want to), but then this level is much too dark. I don't like
	     gamma 4 and brightness set to X-Ray :) With the invisibilty
	     the chaingunners are fortunately not that problem.
	     Only an initial entry, hope there will be improvements.
