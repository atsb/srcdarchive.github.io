  Description : A substantial 3 minutes and 18 seconds faster then Peo's 13:12.
		I'm so glad to get another TNT demo under 10 minutes. All of them
		are do-able under 10 minutes. The final battle takes me on average 
		2:10 seconds to complete and can probably be thought out better.
		This time the final battle is my usual: For a short time I am
		strafing around with 1% health.

		I wonder if Adam Heygi, as the c-n archive maintainer, reads the 
		textfiles also? I bet you he doesn't. So I could call him a slow
		poke and get away with it.

		:-P

		[ Dude, you could at least spell my name correctly. ]
