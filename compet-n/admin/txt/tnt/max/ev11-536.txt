  1:38 minutes faster then Peo's 7:14. Actually, using timer.exe shows that Peo left
  two monsters in the level. I have a pretty horrid run but this level is fustrating.
  With the monsters able to teleport anywhere in a box maze and the fact that I play
  (involuntarily) without sound in DOS forces me to slow down and re-check areas.

  This time can be knocked under 5 minutes. Good luck would help though.
