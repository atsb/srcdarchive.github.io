Description: Wahooo. Finally less than 10 minutes. I would like to have

	     a) a Plasmagun or
	     b) one BFG shot for the Spiderboss [is it useful elsewhere?] or
	     c) Chaingun/SSG at the start or
	     d) Invulnerable for the Crusher (I know now how to do it)
	     e) a backpack
	     
	     One of these would be nice, it would improve the time by one
	     minute each :)
	     That map has a frustrating placement of ammo. On friday every time
	     was slower than 10 minutes, today this is the first LMP where I
	     reach the exit, and it's surprisingly fast.
	     Oh, I know I can leave with monsters alive, the 2 Hell Knights,
	     but I don't think it's fair to replace monsters using an Archvile.
	     100% real kills make it more difficult for the judge (Hi Simon :),
	     but I would prefer it really. You can't replace the Spiderboss
	     here, because you need the red key, but one Baron for a Pig means
	     5 SSG less. And you are punished for killing an Archvile. It would
	     be fairly easy to have some cheap Chaingunners at the hidden Arch-
	     vile. There are some maps that really invite to avoid a Cyberdemon
	     like Pl29, or the original Doom][ map 29. So what can we do?
