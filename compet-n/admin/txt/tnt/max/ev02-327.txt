Description: Hey Gemini, please don't waste my time, i'm tired of beating 
             your demos. You must be a fool, if you think that your demos 
             can stay in compet-n longer than a few days. Cuz i'll 
             defend this one as well as my other records. And better don't
             offend me any more and mind your own bussiness.
