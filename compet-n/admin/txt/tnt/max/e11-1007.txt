Description: If it was a nice level, I would have re-recorded it for
             < 10:00 - But I don't like to search for monsters that
             teleport to 3 or 4 different places. No, not at all. I
             I like the jump and run in the maze, and I take the
             megasphere. (They didn't need it in their fduvdemo.zip
             It's no secret, but I thought I should show you how to
             get it.) I take the plasma gun at the very end of this
             .lmp where it's completely useless. :( I don't know the
             secrets, btw.
             Only an initial entry, hope there will be improvements.
             Under 10:00 !
