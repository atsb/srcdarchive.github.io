  Description:

  Yeah, nice demo Xit, a bit shaking mess here and there, 
  no surprise tho, you know best what is your demo like.
  Don't worry and go ahead, but don't expect to keep it
  long, I kinda started to like this map.

  BahdKo did not ask me to beat this demo. Xit's demo 
  stayed the record for a few days so I decided to take 
  care of it.
