  description:

  a defly improvable demo, 3rd upped recording meant as a base
  to make a more effective and dangerous route.
  i'll do it sometimes later or when someone beats this, but this
  map is so boring that the boredom makes this demo a decent
  one...
  well actually it's a bit more exciting when you take more risks ... :)
  but right now i'm sick of this map.
