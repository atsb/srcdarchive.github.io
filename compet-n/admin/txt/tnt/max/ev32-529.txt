             No, no guys, it's my turn now! hehe....Anthony, i hope 16 secs
             is enough for you. Henna told me that he want to play it too. 
             Henna, wake up (it means stop playing RA for while), it's 
             your turn now. Henna, do you want to get it below TAS time ?? 
             Or should i do it instead of you ?
             Hmm...i was playing it for 2 hours, i think i'm hungry now,
             maybe i should go to eat some fish. :))
         
             Special thanks to Chris and Anthony for their great route.
             
             Note: Cause Final Doom's exe can't handle the joyb_speed31, I
             used the original Doom2.exe (1.9). So, to get a correct
             playback of this lmp use:
             doom2.exe -file tnt.wad -playdemo xxxx
