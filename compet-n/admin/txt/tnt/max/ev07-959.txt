Description: Heh, first I thought it is a large level, because Peo has recorded
	     it in 28 minutes. Now it is under 10 minutes, as every single
	     player one level .lmp should be.
	     You can kill the first few monsters before teleporting, but usually
	     you have to return to kill(most of the time telefrag) a monster 
	     there. You only need the red key, and don't have to raise the
	     bridge, as you can see. And I like SSG more, You have a supercharge
	     and the monsters take care of each other. The only problems are
	     guided Revenant missiles (sometimes).
	     Only an initial entry, hope there will be improvements.
