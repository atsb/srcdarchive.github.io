Description: I really like this map. Ok gameplay, but it's lots of fun. Very
	     good ammo/monster balance. The demo is pretty damn slow, it could
	     be improved a whole lot, but i'll leave that for someone else...
	     And then play it again. I got a little confused a couple places,
	     this was my 5th try i think. Think i had some bad luck in the end,
	     since the 3 Hell Knights teleported before i got the 12 new
	     shells. And it took me too long killing that Arch-Vile in that
	     tower in the end, also the first Arch-Vile. And a bunch of others,
	     but oh well...
