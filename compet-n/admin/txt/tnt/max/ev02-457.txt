Description: Tough map until you killed the Pain Elemental. Then easier.
	     You can decide whether you kill all the Pigs and Cacos with
	     single shotgun or run for the SSG the way I did. Think my way
	     is faster, but you need some luck at the jump. Most of the time
	     pigs will stand there.
	     BTW, it's my first lmp after the GM-Collection, I feel like
	     playing in slow motion, I catch Imp fireballs I thought that
	     must have exploded ages ago :) The Pigs and Spectres move so
	     sloooow. You can kill Dudes and Sergeants without hiding...
	     Ok, it's the first with less than 5:00, if there isn't a better
	     route here I think a 4:30 should be hard to play. Dunno what DL
	     has played so far, might be he has a better lmp already.
