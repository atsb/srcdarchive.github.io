Description: This map really isn't as huge as it seems. It can be difficult
	     with the 2 Pain Elementals, Cacodemon, and that platform that
	     brings the 3 other Chaingunners. I will probably record a better
	     demo for this map, mainly 'cause i don't like the time being more
	     then 10 minutes. Looks messy as a file name...:)
