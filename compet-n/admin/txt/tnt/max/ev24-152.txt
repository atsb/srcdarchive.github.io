  Description:

  1. Thank you part:
  
  Thanks to Anthony Soto, and John Keniry for showing me this map.
  To Anthony again, who persuaded me to use this route, and didn't
  believe that I'm this mad.
  To Ethh, who's a great coach :)

  2. Bullshit part:

  This map was something else...I was totally mad, I was playing it for
  days, 8-9 hours a day straight. When I made a faster run, I always noticed
  an ugly mistake, and tried it again and again. There are some things that can go
  wrong here, you know. Telefragging the revenant, opening the secret door, and
  killing the sergeant with the same shotgun shot, and that damned invul jump.
  This demo is far from perfect, but will make it.

  3. Anthony wanted to trop some words here:

  Anthony Soto (Swedish Fish): Working to get the best routes and tactics on 
  this map was fun. We kept bouncing ideas off each other in IRC. It's nice to 
  see Laszlo get this record. He got me started using the mouse in the first 
  place so it's kind of like teacher beating student. When I recorded ev24-251 
  I never imagined that this map would be improved by 1 minute. I'd like to 
  thank (hehe, it's not even my demo!) John Keniry for starting this in the 
  first place with a great new route and Laszlo for doing a nice run. Nice 
  work guys!
