Description: I was going to upload a 4:21 recording earlier today when I saw
             John Keniry's 3:51 demo. So I watched it, took some ideas from his
             route and tried again. I was now getting times around 3:55 and in
             twenty minutes or so I got this run. Ok, its only a 3 second
             improvement, but I guess It'll do since its my first demo. Good
             max players could maybe get this under 3:30.
