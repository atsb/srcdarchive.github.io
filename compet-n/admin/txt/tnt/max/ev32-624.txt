Description: 1:05 faster then Chris Ryback's previous record. 

	     There are a couple of tactics changes I made. At the door of the
	     second building instead of playing chaingun tag I make a break 
	     for the soulsphere. On your way back it's much easier to kill them.
	     Another key change I made was to set off the mancubi/revenant ambush
	     near the first blue armor early on. As you'll see this causes them
	     to fight each other and on the way back I position myself where I 
	     can let the rockets nail them like flies. The most signifigant 
             change is the conservation of cell ammo in two places. This leaves
	     me with 4 bfg shots for the final battle and things go much quicker.

	     I plan to return to this map (currently I'm waiting for some detailed
	     feedback on routes and strategies from Henning) but it might be a while
	     and I thought I'd give Chris a shot at it. :)
