  Description : I had two objectives in making this demo:
		1) Beat Yonatan's Record
		2) Get it under 5 minutes

		Achieved both those goals by beating Yonantan's 5:08 by 11 seconds.

		Other then that I don't really care enough about this map to do more.
		It's a nice map to look at but there is a lot of things that made 
		this level fustrating. The archie is the first issue since you don't
	        have a chance to get close and you only have a shotgun. This is where
		I variated from Yonatan. I decided to bypass the archie until later
		where I'd make a break for the super shotgun. The tunnel area is a 
		pain. And I rocketed myself three times at the exit door. I would
		open it and keep firing rockets until, without warning (because I have
		no sound), the door would lower and I would fly 15 feet to my death.

		According to my reference this was Yonatan's last Evilution max point.
		Oh well, I'm sure he's got plenty of points elsewhere. :-)
