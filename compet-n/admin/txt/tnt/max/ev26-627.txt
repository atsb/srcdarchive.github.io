Description: Just the 3rd try I guess, so maybe the time is not that fantastic.
	     I like that map, even if it is dark. Unlike with fast monsters
	     you've got now the possibility to berserk the Spectres, and don't
	     have to teleport at the backpack for the 20 shells. Maybe you
	     should use that teleporter only if the Archvile teleports away,
	     and you don't want to meet him in the open area. Or you telefrag
	     him, even better. The yellow key is now a peace of cake, try to
	     get it with fast monsters, it's hell then. Had no time for iddt,
	     so I had to lizzen for Imps wandering around there. Maybe I played
	     that map too much like I did with fast monsters, dunno. If you
	     feel like you have to improve that time, do so. Less than 6:00?
