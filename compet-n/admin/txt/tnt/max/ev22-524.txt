Description: Well, here's another map with a really stupid concept, just like
	     map04. And again, why the fuck would this author think anyone 
	     would wanna spend 5 minutes just to get the Plasma Gun, some Cells
	     and 100% Armor, which you'll have to use in the same places you
	     got them from, when you can exit the map in 20 seconds? I mean,
             in one way you can play through the map in 20 seconds, and the 
	     "maxdemo" way it takes you 5 minutes? Was this designed by Ty
	     Halderman? Is he gettin senile or something? Well, this map sucks,
	     good playability though, except for the tunnels. It could be a fun
	     map, if it only had been changed a bit. By the way this was my
	     second try today, usually i gotta warm up first, but i didn't 
	     enjoy this map so i'll just leave the time the way it is. Maybe
	     a better one later... Oh yeah, almost forgot. There's alot of 
	     linedefs you gotta cross, to get 100% secrets, but why is that
	     when these "secrets" are more like traps, you will go through the
	     "secret" hallways anyway, but this stupid author wants you to 
	     enter every single door in these so called "secret" places. I got
	     5:01 yesterday, but forgot to cross every "secret" line so i only
	     got 88% secrets or something. I really enjoyed TNT: Evilution when
	     i first started recording these demos, but now i hate it thanx to
	     maps like these. Why do you bother reading all this by the way?
