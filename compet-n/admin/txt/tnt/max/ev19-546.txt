	Hmm, I got it under 6 minutes about ten times. The problem was I never 
	(until now) got 100% kills. I had a handful of times that were seconds 
	over 6 minutes with 100% kills. For three days straight I've been going
	crazy (swearing at the monitor, slamming my keyboard/mouse, ripping out
	hair, etc.). Definately Peo, this _WAS_ fustrating. I know I've overused 
	that word but this time I meant it. Fin-a-fucking-finally is all I got 
	to say.
