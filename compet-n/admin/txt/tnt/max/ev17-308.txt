| I spent more time on this Max than on all my MM2 maxes *combined*      |
| This means that:                                                       |
| - the map is pretty good and fun to play                               |
| - the previous record was pretty good, even if not valid               |
|                                                                        |
| I'm leaving lower times to better players :) Thanks to Hitherto. Your  |
| barrel trick is mega cool, unfortunately it doesn't seem to save much  |
| and I didn't used it this time...                                      |
