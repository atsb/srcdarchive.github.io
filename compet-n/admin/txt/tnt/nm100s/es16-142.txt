  Description :)

  There's a story to go with this demo.  At first I tried
  with Dashiva's route.  I was able to slowly work my way
  down to a 1:44 which I got 4 or 5 times before I thought
  I would try another route.  I thought I might try the other
  lift that goes back to the beginning like in speed route.
  I tried in nomo, on old route I got 1:35 and on this new
  route I got 1:30, so even though my second run was much
  cleaner I thought the new route would be better.  Then I
  tried for nm secrets using the new route.  I got 1:44.
  So I decided that on the new route BFG wasn't necessary and
  now I got this.  The jump for the new route is not a hard one.
  Anyway this demo is not perfect.  1:41 could definitely be
  done, and also you can save a little bit of time by using
  plain old doom2.exe.
