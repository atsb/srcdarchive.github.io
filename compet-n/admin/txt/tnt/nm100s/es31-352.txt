Description :

I couldn't resist the fact that I was going to set this one too, before I
found out that Xit Vono already had it at 4:02. Although I will admit that Xit
made this one look easy. I had some problems running this one on Nightmare! for
some odd reason. Especially making the jump from the stairs to the chair,
which I usually don't miss...yet I missed so many times it wasn't even funny >_<

Lost about 5 seconds when my keyboard just up and quit! I stood there, luckily
in an empty hallway. That's why I don't move right there.

Also lost about 2 seconds when I thought I missed the switch that lowers the
wall to the exit where the Shotgunners come out at you by the tons.

All in all I think that this is a good demo in both, appearance and performance
by me. I do believe that if someone gets lucky (or if I decide to do it again)
with a route I was tempted to try, this map could go as short as 3 minutes. Of
course, that's for someone else to attempt, or for me once someone beats this one.

Credits to Xit for this route, although I modified it at places I think. Anyway,
on to something else for me! ^_^
