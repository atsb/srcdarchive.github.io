Description :

10 seconds faster than Xit Vono.

I like this style for this map. The beginning is a bit rough but it's nothing
big. I had a few instances where the Arch-Vile near the Blue Key would respawn
and fry me -_-' Those weren't very pretty.

First exit was 3:43...don't ask how I went from that to this. The 3:43 looked a
lot better than this one, but still, 3:18 isn't a bad time.

I should be in school today, but we had a snow day so we were out for that...so
I thought I'd look around and see what I could do to entertain myself ^^
Unfortunately this came around only after around an hour of trying... -_-'

Under 3:10 possible ^_^
