C-N entry #131.

Another undone bites the dust.  This
one was a constant struggle, but the
secrets all have the right items to
keep you alive.  Tougher than es04,
imho.  Enjoy. :)

PS: Andreas' tn29 is also an es29, so
that's also been done, but it needs to
be changed in the database.  That leaves
2, 8, 9, and 21 undone.
