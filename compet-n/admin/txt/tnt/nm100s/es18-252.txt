  Description :)
  
  I think altima mentioned earlier that the ssg is not a secret
  and that it could be done faster without it.  I think he had some
  sub 3 min time here.  This demo has a few seconds more for
  improvement, although if you can find a way to use stx-vile's
  jump then it could be a lot faster.
