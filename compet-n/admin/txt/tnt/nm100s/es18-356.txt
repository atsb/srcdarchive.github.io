  Description :)

     Part 1 "The Mill" in "The Great Search for Jebus"

  I must report with dismay that Jebus was nowhere to be found in the
  mill. I personally searched through every secret place of this domain
  and was unable to locate him.
 
  Sarget - "What do we now, sire?"

  We move forward.... There are 5 domains left to search, and I am positive
  that Jebus is held within one of those, we must rescue him at all costs,
  even if that cost is my life....
