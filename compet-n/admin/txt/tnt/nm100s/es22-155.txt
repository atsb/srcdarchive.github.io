Description :

13 seconds faster than Chris "Dashiva" Laverdure. I must say, he had quite
an impressive demo, but there was room for improvement ^_^

My improvements come from a nice little trick with the BFG. I grab it and
get out before that little lift goes back up. Secondly, with all that
extra plasma I have from not killing the Imps, I can completely roam those
ugly halls with the Plasma Rifle and not need the Super Shotgun for it at
all. Also...I make smart use of my cells. ^^

I DO lose some time however, when for some reason my Plasma Rifle key gets
stuck. So I couldn't change to the BFG like I normally could. I fixed it
by pressing the Plasma Rifle key again and then make the switch and clear
out that stupid Demon-filled secret room.

This map didn't get any prettier though, that flat error popped up when I
was recording...but I found a way around it. ^_^

Under 2 minutes...you minute barrier people will like this.
