  Description :)  

  5'th demo with the mouse.  I decided that it was best to use
  this route, because the room with all those steel vats is
  quite dangerous on nightmare.  As for the difficulty, it's
  pretty hard, but not as hard as some other stuff I've done
  I think es05 was harder.  Time sucks as I wasted some time
  killing the spider mastermind.
