Comments : Guess the Spectre didn't want me to leave early, bummer.

Same route as before, just with the medkits secret and the BFG. Unlike
the NM-Speed run, being more cautious is better here since going back
for the BFG secret with very little health will more likely get you
killed. Things can go wonky inside the building though, especially if
tough monsters respawn right in front of you.

There's still plenty of room for improvement here, particularly with
going for the BFG, making it out after doing the BFG secret
early can happen, though that'll require tons of luck (probably).
