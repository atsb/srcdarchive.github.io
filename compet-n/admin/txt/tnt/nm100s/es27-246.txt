===================================
Description: In no less than a day, well slightly more than a day, did two more runs on MAP27: Mount Pain, and my,
this time I am seriously going to stop playing this map for a while now. I had a goal of going under 2:50, a
secondary goal being 2:45 if I somehow managed to do everything pretty much pretty despite all odds of luck in
this map, and really, the whole map is a frustrating series of luck testing events. You have to pray that in the
tunnels you don't get fireballs hitting you as you rush blindly to make sure you have a fast time, and then you
have the yellow keycard which is pretty much praying the shotgunners don't suddenly know how to aim at you. The
last part, basically hope nothing kills you and pray the Arch-Vile will infight for a little extra time, but that
rarely happens anyways. Overall, I am done after this run for Mount Pain, man, I never thought I would keep pushing
a map to its limits like that.

There's another demo of my 2:48 run, for the most part it's kind of the same as this but one thing that makes that
demo stand out is a linedef skip at one of the lifts near the end. Earlier in the level I lost so much time because
of some jerky Revenants and Pinky Demos, yet this linedef skipped managed to save me a lot of time, sadly I can't
get it to be repeated so easily as I am on the rush after all. If only I can get this linedef to be skipped
consistently, it's pretty much more time saved, but then again, I have played enough of this map as it is.

Regardless, hooray, I have outdone myself once again!!
