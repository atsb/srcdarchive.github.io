Description: Getting stuck on candles despite that you can walk around
them sure is fun. :)

This map is long and a drag to play, it gets easy once you get outside
but for the first half you may die quickly or you may make it out with
plenty of health to spare. I got a bit lucky that not many Hell Knights
teleported into that room since that was my biggest trouble. I have
tried to go for the BFG first, but since you'll most likely come back
with less overall health, the effort can be a waste.

Not always worth it skipping some monsters either, so better to kill
them so they don't get some free hits from behind.
