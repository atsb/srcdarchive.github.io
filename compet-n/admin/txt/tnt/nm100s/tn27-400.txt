Description:

This map is much more difficult than I expected.
I was often killed by an Arch-Vile in near the exit
I had reached at last. you can enter the teleport 
even if you are killed by it, so it will be an easy 
a little more run if this teleport was the exit. 
Because I thought that the forcing breakthrough 
is impossible, I tried to cancel Vile's attack 
by SSG. however, I failed this tactics two times. 
Fortunately, the Arch-Vile fought with other enemies 
when I reached there next time. I finally finished 
this map, but I did error which is changing SSG to SG. 
Hmm, I didn't remain calm.
