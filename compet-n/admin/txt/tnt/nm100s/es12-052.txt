  Description: Well, i'd upload a better time on this route if I could be
               bothered. If you want to play like this (skip RL and don't
               kill archie), *leave a couple of the troopers alive* - it's
               vital that the archie gets distracted or else he'll kill you,
               and relying on imps to distract him isn't always effective.
