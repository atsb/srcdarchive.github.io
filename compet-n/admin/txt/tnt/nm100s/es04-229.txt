  Description :)
  
  I changed the route around a bit to make it a faster demo.
  Usually I just rush for the rockets but this time I took some
  time to kill stuff first.  I also didn't know what I was doing
  when I got to the arch-vile so it sucks a bit.  Anyways if you
  don't like it then I challenge you to beat this demo.
