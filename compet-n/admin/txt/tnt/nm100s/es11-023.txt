  Description :)  

  My first success was a 25, but I thought that needed
  improvement.  Then I got a 24 but it had a couple of
  mistakes, so I tried it again and after a while I got
  24.00.  This means of course I must improve it again because
  someone could easily get 23, and here it is.  22 is of course
  possible, but I died a lot and got a lot of 24's along the way
  so I won't go for it.
