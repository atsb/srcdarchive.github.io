===================================
Description: My first ever Compet-N entry and I have to say, I felt like I achieved something in my time playing
Doom, especially seeing that a lot of the IWAD records have already been set on stone that it seems impossible
to beat any of them. However, I find that MAP27: Mount Pain wasn't really beaten the best way possible, in fact
the previous best record was 4:00, with my time beating it by a whole minute. My best time on PrBoom+ was 3:06
(that is for 100% Secrets, without I got 2:55), and to beat it by 10 seconds is just astounding to me since I
thought it would be too difficult to go faster.

Nevertheless, I decided to do a more suicidal strategy of just
when going for the yellow keycard, with some luck since I did died many times there. The tunnel part is nothing
I'm unfamiliar with, it's basically just rushing through it while having enough health to take a bit of risk
later (even if I died many times there because of my misfortune). I could have done better if I have not made some
mistakes that costed me a couple of seconds, though maybe I can redo this another time? I am not exactly fond of
playing on DOSBox but well I can adapt to it. Eitherway, a nearly 10 year old record for possibly the most
infamous TNT map has been broken!
