  Description :-)

  21: This is a tough map, but somehow it was easier than I
      expected.  That alternate way for the blue key makes
      this one much easier than the normal speedrun.  I used
      a few seconds to take the blue armor, which helps for
      the next few levels.

  22: This is a very easy map with goodies for the rest of
      the episode.  My running is not good but it's hard to
      lose much time here.

  23: I save health and ammo by doing this one pacifist.
      The monsters don't teleport at the end.  Also saved
      time by skipping the supercharge, something which
      would have been harder without armor from map21

  24: An average time here.

  25: I use a completely new route to the upper level after
      taking the blue key.  I think it's a bit faster and
      avoids all the shotgunners.  Also saved some time with
      better ammo management.

  26: Well I had to shoot the hell knight but other than that
      it's not a bad time.

  27: Saved some time in the red key room by taking the
      invuln early.  It's not really needed after the blue key.

  28: Wow I really suck at this map.  In fact this is the only
      time slower than Stx-Vile.

  29: I suck at this map too.  I saved a ton of time by using
      BFG on the spider mastermind.  I have no idea why Stx-Vile
      didn't use bfg there either.  There's quite a few cells
      lying around on the map.  Also saved a little time by
      skipping the supercharge.

  30: Yep I suck at this map.  First time I reached it a movie
      attempt and I'm lucky that cyberdemon didn't turn me into
      chunky marine soup.

  Again Drew's demo really suffers from a lack of thought out
  routes so that's how I took the advantage on this run.  This
  demo is not very good because I had very little practice with
  maps 28-30.
