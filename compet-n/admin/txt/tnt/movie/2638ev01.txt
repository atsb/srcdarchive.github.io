  2638ev01.lmp - The first ten TNT:Evilution levels done on 
  Ultra Violence nonstop.

  Recorded using Doom ][ executable v1.9.
  To play this demo back correctly, use Doom ]['s doom2.exe
  v1.9, as in the example below:
  
  doom2 -file <tnt_path>tnt.wad -playdemo 2638ev01
  
  where <tnt_path> is the directory where your TNT.wad resides. 
  Note that if played back with the Final Doom's doom2.exe, the 
  demo will go out of sync on Open Season (map06)! This is due 
  to the different way Final Doom's exec handles teleporting.
 
  A lot of ppl forget to mention they use Doom ]['s doom2.exe in 
  their .TXT files, which is *very* annoying. Hope the above mod 
  to the standard Compet-N form will help keep things clear from 
  now on. :>

  Description :-)
  
  (map01): I have no idea how Vince does this one in 27 seconds. 
           The fastest I was ever able to manage was :35. Guess 
           it's things like this that separate Doom Gods from 
           good players :P
  
  (map02): I used to spend over four minutes here - I'm a cautious 
           mofo! With luck, you can ignore the crowd of Pinkos and
           Specters on the main battlefield; but you often pay the 
           price later on if they start acting up when you have to 
           jump to the Yellow Key ... With lots of luck, I get 
           around 1:50 sometimes.

  (map03): Xit's average (1:57) is much better than mine. But he's 
           a much better player anyway ...

  (map04): ... even when he plays it safe (:33). I don't remember 
           having anything under :37 here even if I threw caution 
           to the winds.

  (map05): There's no need to waste time on either the Supercharge 
           or the Blue Armor - the next board is quite easy and 
           has plenty of Medkits. Perhaps it's possible to cut down 
           some time by braving all those Chain Dudes on the balcony 
           instead of feeding them some rockets from afar.

  (map06): A very easy level; except no matter how fast you run and 
           dodge, you won't be able to get below three minutes due 
           to the map's size and lack of shortcuts. 
           Well, at least not if your name doesn't have a Catalaa 
           or Vono somewhere in it :P.

  (map07): Run like hell, and hope the Skeleton at the end will be 
           nice to you :>.

  (map08): This is just a sneak preview of the sheer size of the TNT 
           maps to come. I used to spend over seven minutes here. Gah.

  (map09): It's not uncommon to have difficulties shortcutting to the 
           Red Key switch. Fortunately, I managed to avoid them this 
           time around.

  (map10): I didn't realize the run was practically over almost until 
           the end. This TXT file took longer to write, I think!

  This is my first submission to Compet-N, a route that I worked out 
  largely on my own. My humble respects go out to the incredible skills 
  of all Compet-N'ers. You guys are out of this world!
  Thanks to Rob Elwood and Doug "Opulent" Merill of the r.g.c.d.* fame 
  for their support of my TNT endeavor.
