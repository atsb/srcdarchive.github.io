Description:
Well, that was close, 3 more seconds and I would have had to do this whole thing over again.

This is 4:19 faster than the previous record, so not too bad, but most of that comes from
including a couple of tricks. In 30ev4416 I did a really slow glide\map 17, and this time I 
did a key grab trick on map 05 discovered by Looper, thanks to 4shockblast for teaching me 
how to do it consistently. I also do a trigger skip on map 25, so I skip the entire map 
pretty much. Map 25 trigger skip was somehow discovered by cyberdemon531, but 4shockblast
was the first to do the trick. I came up with the consistent (well, I would hardly call
4 inputs on the same frame as consistent, because that is not easy!) method to do this trick.
I'll put some more details on the setup under map 25.

If we don't count maps 5,17,18,25 then the time was improved by 1:35 over 30ev4416.


Map 01: I am not a big fan of tyson and this map... or the whole wad either :)
Horrible time, my best time is around 8 seconds faster, the IL is 19 seconds faster.
IL doesn't grab mega armor, but I don't need to either, however it increases my chances
of getting past the next maps a lot.


Map 02: This map used to be very annoying when I did 30ev4416, this time around it
was not even close to be as bad as it was then. More often than not I made the YK
jump. Not a good time though. 


Map 03: Same goes for this map, used to be very difficult, but now I get through
much more often, but again a really bad time.


Map 04: Short map, actually the shortest in the whole run. Requires some luck
when you are low on health, this time it went pretty good.


Map 05: New trick (in 30ev), yellow key grab through the wall. A really amazing 
trick, I wonder how Looper comes up with stuff like this :) Makes the map easier as well.

I did discover that vertical mouse movement is not needed for this trick, it's a bit
more difficult to do, but possible.


Map 06: Wow, this time is really something horrible isn't it. The funny thing is when
I did 30ev4416 I was having so much trouble trying to match j4rio's 2:21 on this map,
when I started practicing this map again the first time I got was 2:21, my best time 
is 2:07 (with weapons of course), though 2:20 is still a good time, so around 25+ seconds
lost here. 

I really did not deserve to survive this map.


Map 07: This map is quite easy as long as you don't get blocked by spectre going 
to the exit or take a heavy hit from the revenant.


Map 08: I've gotten a lot better on this map as well, the pacifist strategy in
the last room works very well. It's not too big of a risk to run past the 
arachnotrons at the exit, and actually something I didn't think about was
switching to chaingun to painstate them, something I figured out would be
very useful in this attempt, where I used plasma.


Map 09: Don't forget the blue key, or you'll look stupid. I didn't this time.
So for this map I only want to survive really. You can save a lot of time here 
if you are feeling lucky :)


Map 10: I really hate dying on this map, since it's straight after map 09 and
there is so much health and armor at the start. Went okay this time.


Map 11: Easy map, I try to shoot just before I run past the 2 fences, this will
wake up the imps on the other side which can make them open the door, didn't work
this time. 


Map 12: Another easy map. 


Map 13: Almost didn't get past the revenant by YK, that could kill me quickly.


Map 14: This map is sometimes difficult, lots of hitscan, you never know if
they hit you a lot or what the damage rolls will be.


Map 15: I get the BFG here, movement needs to be decent, if you get stuck
somewhere you have to hit the switch again and that will cost a lot of time.
I don't think you get a BFG until map 30 after this one with this route.


Map 16: I have no idea how to move through this level, I didn't practice it too much 
though, amazing IL time by xit-vono here.


Map 17: South directed guideless glide, same as in map 09 of plutonia. I have vertical
mouse movement enabled which makes it a bit more difficult, but I got lucky this time and 
didn't have to use any, which randomly happens sometimes. Got hit by chaingunner just 
as I went through, so yeah, really lucky.


Map 18: Got the rocket jump first try! I also could have skipped the invurn\soulsphere.
You do however get 2 more chances if you do pick them up, at the cost of 15-20 seconds or 
so for each attempt. That cyberdemon was really close to killing me there, he has killed
2 runs so far, 1 was before I did 30ev4416. I think I woke him up a bit early, did not
really look into that.


Map 19: Easy map.


Map 20: Awful map. The large outdoor area is done pacifist, prevents monsters from
teleporting in.


Map 21: Another awful map. I died less than an hour ago before I got this run on this map,
I went through the teleporter after grabbing YK and got destroyed with 100\37 health\armor
down to 7\0 by 2 hellknights instantly. I don't know the odds of having 2 hellknights within 
melee range but not within the telefrag range like that. A fireball followed shortly after to 
end the run.


Map 22: A really awful map, at least it's short.


Map 23: This map is ok, need to keep my health for the rocket boost on map 25.


Map 24: Try to keep as much health as possible, you can run past the hell knight
without much trouble, but I didn't want to risk anything.


Map 25: This trick is really hard, there is a linedef here that if you skip it, 
you can exit the map straight away like I did. I spent quite a deal of time trying
to find this setup, 4shockblast has already shown it in ev25p013 using the shotgunner
somehow, but that is way too inconsistent for 30ev. So I figured there would have to 
be some way to do it with a rocket boost, and after a lot of trial and error I 
managed to skip it, but then it's a matter of doing it again with consistency. 

Unlike dead simple (doom 2 map 07) you don't have a few frames when you can shoot the rocket.
If you fire 1 frame off here you won't make it, and if you have to shoot after you start moving
then it is extremly difficult to time the rocket. So I figured the only way to make this 
possible was to continue looking for some position+angle that if you use 
Run+StrafeLeft+MoveBack+StrafeOn+TurnLeft+Fire on the same frame (you can just hold Run+StrafeOn
so 4 inputs need to be activated on the same frame) you will skip the trigger. 
Luckily such a thing existed, but if any of the inputs is a frame off you fail it. I used to lose
runs to Chasm (doom 2 map 24) when I failed to hit 3 inputs at the same time, so this one
isn't too much fun :)


Map 26: At this point I am quite sure I will make it to the end, because none of
the next maps should be much of a problem... a final time of 39:57 shows that I 
should have considered picking up the pace :)


Map 27: Mount Pain.


Map 28: There's 2 mega spheres on this map, usually I don't have to grab the second
one, but I wasted too much health here to feel safe for the next map.


Map 29: Be careful with the crushers, they will kill you from 200\200.


Map 30: That was a decent final room, however not a very good time. I take things very
safe with the lost souls since they can telefrag you. If I had any idea what the time
was looking like I would have absolutely rushed through this map. 


39:57, my goal was sub 40 minutes. While there are many things that could have been done 
better, I am very happy with this time. I don't like TNT as much as Doom 2 or The Plutonia Experiment,
so I have not put as much effort into it. I figure this will be somewhat hard to beat for 
anyone looking to pick it up because of tricks on maps 17,18 and 25, but still very beatable
because of maps like 1,2,3,6,9,10,26,28 and 30.

This is my final demo for this category :)
