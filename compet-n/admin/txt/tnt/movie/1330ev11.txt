C-N entry #139, movie run #26.

11: The usual time, thanks for letting me know about the mega, xit. :)
12: The usual time again, a freebie level with an RL.
13: Not bad, but my best was 1:11 with gutsy play at the red key.
14: I lost some time here due to angry ceilings that come down when I'm
    ready to cross the lava, so I had to wait a few times.
15: Thanks for the BFG tip, xit.  So I don't know the levels that well,
    but that only means more room for improvement. :)
16: Not a bad time, but with some sloppy play at the yellow key.  I had
    to slow down and say hi to my best friends, the sticky walls.
17: The BFG helps with smacking down the archvile at the blue key.  This
    was my fastest time, but I spent extra time at the red key collecting
    cells for later (very helpful).
18: An easy level, the end can be intimidating sometimes.  One time the
    cyberdemon moved in front of me whenever I tried to get by, and it
    lasted that way for 5 seconds without him firing at me.  It was funny
    to watch, too bad I couldn't get that in the demo. ;) 
19: This was a definite time saver, missing the BFG would make it very hard
    to get the time below 1 minute.
20: I goofed off a bit at the end, first falling in the river, then hoping
    the archvile would come out and boost me over to the other side of the
    water.. oh well, maybe someone else will be lucky enough to pull it off
    in a movie..?  hint hint. :))

Like before, thanks to Jim for some new routes and showing me how wussified
my old movies were.  Perhaps he'll attempt to improve the ev21 movie (which
I won't try to improve, it's a horrible level set aside from 28, IMO).  He's
also attempting to pull off the first ever tn21 movie, so be on the lookout
for that prize. :)

As for my next movie project, I'm keeping it to myself in case I lose interest
in recording again and never get around to something I promised, so who knows
what will happen.
