  TNT Evilution – Episode 2 – UV Fast

Comments:
Once I saw Xit Vono's Episode 2 NM100S run, I knew this was possible.
A good chunk of my attempts were fuckups on Map 11, so it's nice to know
I survived all of this. The times are a bit slow, I will admit, but hey,
it's faster than the current MAX run for this episode. That should count
for something.

11 – Storage Facility
Pretty risky for the first map, having to survive with little armor while
fighting off the teleporting hordes of monsters. There were a couple
attempts where the arch-vile resurrected monsters and let them go
outside, so I look around for a bit to make sure I catch them, but
there werent' any.

12 – Crater
The huge infight between mancubi, arachnotrons and barons is a pretty
nice excursion through, mainly because I can get a soul sphere once it's
finished. Obviously, I save this for the end. Near the RL area, one of
the chaingunners infighting with imps actually walked all the way over
to the side, which surprised me a bit.

13 – Nukage Processing
Outside, the mancubi were a bit of a pain, so I improvised a strategy.
I always love manipulating the cyberdemon for my liking so I don't take
any blast damage from hitting the window. I save the megaarmor for the
end. Unfortunately, I left with 22% health at the end of the level. :(

14 – Steel Works
A level filled to the brim with hitscanners. Essentially a less intense
version of Stronghold. Having low health didn't really affect me at the
beginning because of how the zombies tend to have really inaccurate aim.
At the blue key part, one of the pain elementals was kind enough to kill
himself with the nearby crusher.

15 – Dead Zone
Ah yes, the level where a caco and PE can't be woken up, thus justifying
97% kills max on this level. At 1:10, I get the chance to let 2 imps
infight with each other due to them shooting a barrel, but I don't notice
until it's too late. At 4 ½ minutes, I use blast damage to kill the
demons below because I had low health, but ended up losing more.

31 – Pharoah
This level will desync if you don't have the proper patch for it.
The soul sphere part is bullshit due to how many enemies are shooting
all at once. The cyberdemon is definitely a lot easier here because
of how you can make it so he doesn't hit you.

32 – Caribbean
The highlight of this level is not taking any damage in the first minute.
I always loved BFGing all the hitscanners about to teleport. Another
highlight is at the end where I don't take any damage during the final
fight with the cyberdemon.

16 – Deepest Reaches
I saved up a lot of rockets from the last level, so I use them to my
liking here. The PE decided to come in near to me, which is fine
considering I want to kill him ASAP. Nothing else to say about this level
otherwise. Almost 2 minutes faster than the Ep 2 Max run of this level.

17 – Processing Area
A short little blast through the area. A PE decided to come in early,
which is all fine by me. Again, not much to say. Good thing the arch-vile
didn't stall any progress with the teleporting like what sometimes happens.

18 – Mill
In the area with four switches, I only open up two and “illegally” press
the other two. Also, I end up killing two lost souls with 1 SSG shot.
Doesn't happen that often IMO. While the cyberdemon kills the hell
knights, I take the time to refill my health and get an invulnerability.
I'm just barely able to kill the cyber before it runs out. Got a bit
cautious because I heard some splashing once all the enemies were killed,
but I assume it was just some lost souls.

19 – Shipping/Respawning
Pretty easy IMO. I go into the soulsphere secret early so I'll have 100%
secrets even if I don't get the powerup. Once I get the red key, I end up
making the mistake of taking longer than normal and end up making the PE
spawn more lost souls. I get the megasphere to help relieve tension for
the final level.

20 – Central Processing
Oh, god, here we go. This level is quite dangerous IMO. I'm essentially
using up a good chunk of cell and rocket ammo from the previous levels
to deal with what's going on here. The red key part is hell enough, and
then you get to the berserk part, unleashing tons of spectres and demons.
I save the berserk for the end because I'll get more health on the way
anyway. I excessively surveil the blue armor area to make sure there
aren't any stragglers. I had an attempt where those 3 far-away
chaingunners walked into the teleporter to the soulsphere area, and I was
proceeding to the final area, he appeared there, and couldn't kill him,
so I frustratingly died. The spiderdemon part is awkward as I didn't have
enough armor to safely BFG it, so I had to SSG it instead. Everything
after is okay, and I completely finish it safely.
