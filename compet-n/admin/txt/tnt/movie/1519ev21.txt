Credit to xit for the route improvements.
I wasn't too fond of these levels b4, tho
my mindset has regressed to a time when
I didn't care about how levels looked, I
just sat back and had a good time running
through them.  This wasn't a big effort so
don't expect the best, there's some room
for improvement around this one.  Map29
was probably my ugliest here, haven't been
to that level in ages. :)
