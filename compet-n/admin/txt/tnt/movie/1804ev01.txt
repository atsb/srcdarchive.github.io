  Description :-)

  1: Not bad

  2: Fairly good time here

  3: I screwed up this map and had to get the berzerk.

  4: Rushed this one a bit too much.  It didn't really
     hurt because the beginning of map05 is pretty
     easy.

  5: Soulsphere isn't really necessary here, so I skip it

  6: This is an average time here.

  7: Hmmm I don't know how Stx-Vile made that 59 second
     run here.  I guess he had much luck or something.

  8: Run sucks.

  9: After getting nice times for the previous maps I didn't
     want to die here, so it could have been a bit faster.
     The key to doing this one fast is to save rockets and
     plasma for this map.

  10: Maybe a bit cautious here.  It seems Stx-Vile was
      cautious at the end, because I beat all his times for
      maps 8-10, even though my runs don't seem so great.

  This is probably more fun than maps 11-20, because there's
  lots of fighting in this one, so if you want a good time you
  need to take risks.
