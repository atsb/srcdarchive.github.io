C-N entry #46, movie run #18.

01: The awesome tyson-style start level. :)
02: I still don't like this map much.
03: I grew to like this map more during the 30ev recordings.  It plays similarly to
    map09 with low level monsters in tight corridors.
04: A very short level, just run up the stairs, run back down and exit.
05: This map is OK.. at least nothing can go wrong here.
06: Another corridor/weak-monster map, this one is also fun, IMO. :)
07: Not a tough map, with some extra cells to be picked up here.
08: My least favorite episode 1 map.. still, I ran it faster in this movie than I
    ever did in my ev01 attempts. :)
09: I love this map!  Probably my favorite from episode 1 after map01, it's just fun
    to slice through armies of formerhumans/imps.
10: I get a ton of cells here, which will pay off even a long time from now.
11: A short level with a soulsphere!
12: Another short level with.. nothing!  A whole lot of nothing.. that red key area
    is waaaaay too empty.
13: Another short level, only a bit tougher.  The end in particular can drain your
    health quickly sometimes.
14: A map similar in ugliness to map08, only with more slime.
15: Damn, did something really stupid and owned myself with a barrel here.  I had
    To find more health to make sure that I survived the beginning of map16.
16: Not much trouble here, since a megasphere is just what I needed after map15. :)
17: No troubles here, with a 200% armor and more cells for the taking.
18: I lost an attempt at the end of this one when the cyberdemon sat on the exit
    and fired continuously.. I take a short sidetrip to an invincibility to fix
    that problem. :)
19: Another map with a free megasphere for the taking.
20: This map is long, but doesn't pose a problem unless I ended up having low
    health at the end for some reason.
21: Ouch, this map can be trouble.. I take a little time here to grab a megasphere
    and make sure I get out alive. :)
22: I like this map for the 240 free cells (and a soul sphere at the start if I
    need it), but there's something about this level that just creeps me out..
    Legend has it that the ghost of a doom god roams the poorly designed hallways
    of this level.. some call it the "Dashiva," while others claim it's just a
    crack-smoking monkey.. we'll never know for sure..
23: An easy map unless something weird happens.. I actually ran right through the
    exit in one attempt and got clawed by the baron on the other side. :)
24: This map is short, but I take my time to kill the revenant at the blue key from
    below, just in case.  He can actually punch you to death while you're waiting
    for the elevator to rise sometimes.
25: Ugh, ugly map with dark passageways.. but at least I finally get the BFG here.
26: Ugh, an even worse map than 25.. I lost an attempt here because the level caused
    the game to crash, so I got a little nervous while running through that one area.
27: This might be the toughest map from the whole thing, since rushing it can result
    in an agonizing death.  I take my time to clear out the hallways after the blue
    key.
28: This is the only episode 3 map that I like, it's design is interesting enough.
    I lost an attempt at the red key, so I wake the revenants and let them move out
    of the way first before running back out.
29: An easy map, and the extra cells allowed me to take down the spiderdemon quicker
    and handle the yellow key area more safely.
30: Kinda stressful for an end map, even if it's easy.  I am never sure about the
    beginning part, plus I almost get knocked into lava early on, but I finished
    regardless. :)

I'm pretty satisfied with the way this run turned out.  Not a lot went wrong and
I didn't have to make too many side trips to stock up on health/ammo.  Enjoy the
run, because I think at this point that I'm done with evilution. :)
