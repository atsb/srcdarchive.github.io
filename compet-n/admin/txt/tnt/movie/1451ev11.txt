C-N entry #44, movie run #16.

11: This is the first time I got a :26 here.. cool. :)
12: Not a tough map.. the only thing of benefit here is the RL.
13: Ouch, barely escaped with my life at the end of this one.
14: Extremely low health at the start.. I'm amazing that I lived through it. :)
15: Another low health start, but it doesn't matter much until map16.
16: An unhealthy start usually means death, but somehow I got lucky enough to
    live through it again.
17: An average map, with some slowdown at the yellow key, but the archvile just
    didn't want to die right away. :)
18: Another map that seems strangely underpopulated, especially at the yellow key
    area.
19: Haw haw, Shipping/Respawning, I get it. :)
    I didn't have to pick up the megasphere here, which saved some time.
20: The longest map, but no problems here unless you have an unhealthy start.

This episode is the easiest of the 3, where combat is lacking in many areas and
there is not a lot that can go wrong, mostly due to a lack of tricks that I can
mess up repeatedly. :)

Thanks again to the players who previously ran this episode:

- Vincent Catalaa
- Chris "Ryback" Ratcliff
