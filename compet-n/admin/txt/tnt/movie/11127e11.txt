  Description :-)

  This is a by-product of my TNT 32max sessions.  Now there is
  only one episode left undone - the third one. Let's hope it 
  won't take another four years; TNT ain't that bad, is it? :)

  *Getting 100% kills on MAP15 is theoretically possible, but 
  in practice is very unlikely. The two unreachable monstars 
  are the Caco and the Pain Elemental behind the north-eastern 
  wall. They never get a chance to see you, that's the problem.
  It _may_ be possible to maneuver another Caco or a Lost Soul
  near them and hope to wake the sleepers with a blast wave off
  the maneuvered floater; in theory, yes. To get something up 
  there to the right height and just the right place without
  killing it in the process would take a lot of time and patience.
  In a single-level run, maybe, and (quite likely) with a little 
  help from TAS.
 
  Update: this is a re-upload to correct the total time and the 
  filenames - the original listed 1:11:27 and was named 7127EV11.
  Update 2: filenames shortened to comply with the 8+3 DOS limit.
