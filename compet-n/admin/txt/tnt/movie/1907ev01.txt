C-N entry #43, movie run #15.

01: A very fun tyson-style map. :)
02: Not particular fond of this map, as the demons can ruin the jumps to the
    yellow key and back.
03: This map can be tricky, but at least I get an RL out of it.
04: Short and easy map, not really affecting the run at all.
05: Not too tough, although I seem to get caught on these walls pretty easily. :)
06: This map is strangely fun to play, despite the cramped hallways.
07: A nice invincibility for me here!
08: This map is yucky.. the end scene especially, but oh well.  I thought it was
    funny when the sarge falls off that high ledge, though. :)
09: This map is one of my favorites from evilution.  It's more action-packed than
    most other TNT maps.
10: An easy end map with a ton of cells that I don't get to use. :)

Well, I've played all 3 TNT episodes already before making the text files, so I can
say without a doubt that this episode is my favorite of the three.

I believe most of the credit for this run should go to those who previously ran it:

-Vincent Catalaa
-Serge "Never_Again" Marudov
-Xit Vono
