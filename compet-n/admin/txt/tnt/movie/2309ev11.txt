  Description:
  
  Level 11: An ugly start to the run, usual is about 0:26. 
            Rocket launcher isn't necessary but it's easy to 
            get.
  
  Level 12: About the normal.
           
  Level 13: I get the 200% armor for 14. Missed the red key 
            first up: 10s lost.

  Level 14: Supercharge isn't necessary, I just like playing
            safe.

  Level 15: Nothing to say... if you can't do this there's
            something wrong.

  Level 31: Ammo dump time... The remaining levels would be 
            much harder without all this plasma. I 
            pause a little for the strafejump, then 
            spend some time faffing around... sorry about 
            that, I was playing without sound.
 
  Level 32: Fairly average, I'm not sure how that PE 
            survived my BFG blast...

  Level 16: Very easy run, nothing can go wrong.

  Level 17: Mucked up the Archie scene badly... under 1min 
            should be easy.

  Level 18: Heh heh.. too slow, Cybie :)

  Level 19: End got mucked up...

  Level 20: It's necessary to clear out the start, I could have 
            probably gone faster with all the health I had...

  This is a good episode for running, most of the levels
  can be done quickly and they're all easy.
