C-N entry #138, movie run #25.

01: My fastest here was :37, so not a bad run.
 
02: Ugly, but an average time, my fastest here was 1:08.

03: I felt lucky after surviving the blue key with my lower
    than usual health.

04: My usual time.

05: Low health at the blue key, but I recovered in time to
    collect the medikits.

06: This felt like a disaster during play, the cacodemon at the
    yellow key woke up early and blocked my exit, and my health
    at the dark maze should have killed me (I won't ruin it for
    you though. :)

07: Not quite luck, I just didn't fall at the end, thank you
    very much. :)  :57 is my fastest here.

08: My fastest time by far, everything went my way here.  I knew
    my goal for under 16 minutes was within reach with this time.

09: The usual run, under 3 minutes was reached before but required
    the extra cells I spent trying to exit map08.

10: Another disaster, bad luck fated the PE to block me from the bulk
    cells, so I had to retreat.  I also switched to the single barrel
    accidently, so this is my worst time overall.

I agree my previous movie was slow, so I tried to make this movie an 
enjoyable upgrade.  It's ugly, but I needed to set my limits after
realizing that all of my best looking runs are guaranteed to fail and
the ugly ones will be the fastest, naturally. Thanks to xit for his
routes and emphasis on risk-taking to improve the times, it was the
inspiration for this run.  I realize I don't play nearly as much as I
used to, but I am starting to lose interest in finding new stuff to try.
I will probably improve old movie records once in a while, though, so
ol' twoface isn't done for good just yet. :)
