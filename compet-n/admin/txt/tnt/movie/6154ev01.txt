  Description :-)

  Nothing to write home to Mom about here =). Almost every map takes 
  me at least two minutes more than the corresponding UV Max single 
  level record. And if you expect some fancy strafe-50s or Arch Vile 
  jumps, just fuggeddabuddit =). Still, you gotta start somewhere ...
  and I can't help wondering why no one did this before.

  Kudos to Xit Vono, whose staunch recordings are always an 
  inspiration, and to stx-Vile for turning the Compet-N world upside 
  down. Respects to both for living out the "it's nice to be important, 
  but it's more important to be nice" line.
