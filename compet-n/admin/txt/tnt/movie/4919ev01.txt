  "5445EV01" is DeDo's max run from last month

  "par" is current Compet-N UV max record
  all maps 100% kills and secrets, except MAP04 101% kills

  Description :-)

  DeDo expressed regret at failing to get the time under 
  54 min, so I thought he'd be pleased to see it done under 50.
  Besides, it's nice to have this entry back. =)

  A few days ago I resumed my perennial attempts at the TNT 
  max movie. One of the sessions was going pretty well, when I
  had to abort after MAP11 because of a missed secret. Playing 
  it back  with prBoom+ (god bless e6y!) revealed that it was 
  the lift with two barrels on it and more importantly, total 
  time for 1st episode - 50:22. Until then I had been doubtful
  that I could do it faster than 50 min, but this was close 
  enough for me to consider trying.
  
  MAP01
  A pretty good run. I've had 0:59, and a couple of times 0:57
  but with a missed monstar. Anything under 1:06 is OK with me; 
  my lousy strafe50 technique leaves me out of contention for 
  speedrunning laurels on pretty much any map.
 
  MAP02
  Vince says he cannot do MAP30 reliably, but like DeDo, I find
  this and the first map the hardest. On MAP01 I'm constantly 
  reminded of Pecka's record and the huge gap between it and 
  what the tally screen tells me. Here it is the numerous 
  "jumps": to the staircase, where a Demon can block you any 
  time or you simply don't make it just because; to the Blue 
  Armor secret (don't laugh :); back to the ledge from the Soul 
  Sphere ...
  I've run through and aborted hundreds of runs on this map, 
  and the fact that I still think it pretty cool must mean it 
  probably is. Once I even managed to get the two Hell Knights 
  by the exit to fight over who set off the barrel! I include
  that .lmp (KNIGHTSF), if anyone wants to see it. Use prBoom+
  and "-skipsec 300" to go straight to the meat.
  
  Time under 4min was completely unexpected, usually it's 
  4:11-4:25. This was a great encouragement to make the best 
  of this run. At the same time the thought of fscking up after
  such a good start kept haunting me until the end.
  Here I opted for chaingunning all the pigs at close quarters 
  early on rather than  trying to nail them with the double 
  barrel from high on the ledge later. It looks like the Hell 
  Knight decided to to give me a hand with the Cacos, as well.

  MAP03
  DeDo shall take the credit for making me play this more
  aggressively. I used to be content with 4:something here. 
  As Surgeon General warns, extra speed may lead to health 
  problems; and I often had times longer than DeDo's because 
  I had to pay for my carelessness with a trip to the Berserk
  pack at the end. Here I was happy to keep the Skeletons' 
  missiles out of my face for the most part.

  MAP04
  The class of my play starts to be felt. =) Missed the fake 
  exit trigger twice! The Archie managed to resurrect a Pinky 
  and an  Imp but I was so pissed I didn't even notice until 
  the replay.  It's  a wonder how I got under par here; no 
  doubt the extra ammo and  the RL from the previous levels 
  help.  Could be that my route is  the most natural as well, 
  even though no one ever uses it (which is a reason enough 
  for me to stick with it. :P
  
  MAP05
  Uncharacteristically, the Revenants-and-Barons stew didn't
  go  down too well. I look at it now and just can't believe 
  I wasted ten rox on the Skeletons. Happy with the time 
  though, it used to be around 5:00 not so long ago.
  
  MAP06
  A simple, straightforward level where it's hard to fsck up. 
  Which makes it all the more puzzling why I consistently get
  worse times than anyone else. Perhaps rushing to the Blue 
  Key and leaving the  Mancubus room for later is the right 
  strategy, but here I did accomplish the nearly impossible 
  and managed to fall off the walkway to the Yellow Key. In 
  my defence I must point out that I only fell once. =) I 
  guess it would be false modesty if I failed to mention 
  another highlight: blowing up a rocket into my face and
  half the health points with it ...  Oh yeah, and the Archie
  at the exit lift gave me a lift. I'm sure you can't wait
  to see the demo if you haven't already, at this point. :D

  Intermission screen
  I almost always let the text roll to the end. I feel it 
  is only proper, and what's the hurry, anyway? If you are 
  ready to give up an hour of your life to see this demo, 
  surely another ten seconds doesn't make a difference?
  Besides it'sa handy opportunity to stretch back in the
  chair and pat yourself on the back for half the job well
  done. If  the text is sitting still with nothing happening,
  that means the tea mug needed a refill, sorry.
  Now that I read Roger Zelazny's "For a Breath I Tarry", I 
  think I know why I feel the compulsion to sit through the 
  the message of the intermission screen. Read it and you 
  may know, too. Even though the story has nothing to do 
  with DOOM, it's a fascinating blend of sci-fi and the 
  biblical.
 
  MAP07
  This may be the first episode's 99% kills champ, but that 
  somehow never bothered me. I only had them here once or 
  twice. On the positive side, I've been known to miss the 
  jump to the  first teleporter on occasion. =) Also falling
  off it when  checking for teleported baddies later on, but
  that not often.
  Early on for a while there it looks like the demo is going 
  out of sync. Don't hit the F10 yet, it's just my mad skillz.
  Later I forgot to check that teleporter and almost had the
  dreaded 99%, as some nosey sumbitch found his way there 
  despite me doing my best to make a thorough sweep outside.
  What else? Just to make sure there is room for improvement
  for the next run, I fell off the walkway to exit. That one
  is gonna be hard to beat.

  MAP08
  Knowing how lousy my timing is, I always feel a huge wave
  of relief wash over me when I make the first rising pillar
  in that huge chamber on the first attempt. As you will see,
  the feeling was a bit premature in this case. I also spent 
  three rockets too many on the last Arachnotron, but you're
  probably not surprised at this point.

  MAP09
  This level is best appreciated after you tried it on NM!
  or -respawn. Here, for the first time ever, I got stuck 
  at the plated glass window with two Sarges through pressing
  the buttons in the wrong sequence or something and raising
  the glass instead of lowering it. By now you are probably 
  thinking that I did this and the hundred other dumb things
  in this demo on purpose, just to show how lame a valid 
  Compet-N entry could be while beating the previous record
  speed-wise; but I assure you that that's just the way I
  play every day.

  MAP10
  I didn't miss the opportunity to put the fate of the 
  whole run in danger by letting my health slide down into
  single digits at one point. This section also features
  a befuddled search for something that was not there. It's
  in the Red Key area, see if you can spot it. I'm also proud
  to say I had more than a hundred cells at the exit - the old
  compulsive hoarding aka cheap ass syndrome. I promise to do
  something about it within another five years.
