  Description :-)
  
  [ df: ]
	Again, this great azerty keyboard :)
	I suggested the map, but after quite some times, it was quite
	annoying :) but well, we kicked the monsters butt :)

	well, another decent demo. we had to waste quite a few good shots
	because of caco's fleeing the party ... anyway, some parts of it
	are pretty funny, i believe.
