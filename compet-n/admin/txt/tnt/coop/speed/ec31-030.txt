BahdKo:  Adam Hegyi rules, you should check out his solo demo on this map :)
	 Altima and I could have gotton this faster if we had more time.

Altima:  I really wanted to do this map, so I managed to talk BahdKo into it.
         We had a 0:28 with -nomonsters once, but our best (for the amount of
         time we had) was 0:30, with monsters. Speaking of which, this map
         threw me a few surprises when Bahd and I first played it with the
         monsters on the map. 0:29 is possible, and we would eventually have
         gotten it. And yeah...check out Hegyi's solo on this map, it's good!
         This was also a Pacifist entry. ^_^
