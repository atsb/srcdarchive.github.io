PerOxyd:  Some lag, but the cooperation worked well between us. Thx for this
          coop Altima.

Altima:  This map is awesome for Coop, in my opinion. Vince had low health for
         the entire demo, but we got out this time, despite that evil Cyberdemon
         he has to get by. Our ping was around 180 - 200 and I have some sloppy
         parts due to that. The switch trick is a little harder for me due to the
         lag, but it's not terrible ^^ Anyway, enjoy ;)
