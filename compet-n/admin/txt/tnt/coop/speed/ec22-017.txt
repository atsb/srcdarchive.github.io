  Description :-)
	
	I'd not say it's optimal, with people like Sedlo and Ocelot hanging around you are
        never sure about an optimal :)

	The jump is by Altima/Ogre and the shotgun boost is by Dashiva. Both save some time.
        The only things we added are some boost after getting the invul.
