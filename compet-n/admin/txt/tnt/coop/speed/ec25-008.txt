Altima:  Yay! An optimal run in which I do NOTHING! XD Watch my amazing
         talent of standing perfectly still...after a little debating, I
         decided to let Ogre do the running, since he is much faster than
         I am. I discovered the route while watching the max for this one
         and I just started wondering about the map's design. So I looked
         at it in an author and I found out there's a small area that
         is inaccessable in single-player mode because when you run out of
         the start area, it closes permanently and there's no way to open
         it up again. Anyway, after looking at it, I was wondering where
         the coop starts were, and found that the remaining 3 players
         start outside of the opening hallway. Now, go watch the demo,
         since you know the story to this route ^_^ Pacifist is possible,
         but will require 3 people to do.

OgreSlayR:  my best run yet..took awhile to get this..demons arent very
            cooperative..lots of random times..
