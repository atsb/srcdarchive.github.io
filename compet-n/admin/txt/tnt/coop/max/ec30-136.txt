  Description :-)
  
  [ df: ]

	The beginning took some time for me to figure out the route, as 
	like this azerty keyboard :)
	The cyber was quite easy when we found out that it walks left if
	you come in shooting your gun.

	yes, that cybbie is stupid. thanks for letting me the honor to
	frag the boss. it's all that matters in map30's anyway ...
	this demo has no further pretention that being a decent (good) demo.
	there's no exploit nor blunder, it goes pretty smooth, so we'll
	leave it at that for the time being. since the final doom coop
	tables are to fill, our priority is now to record as many good
	demos as possible, so that the tables actually look like something.
	later on, we'll improve existing demos.
