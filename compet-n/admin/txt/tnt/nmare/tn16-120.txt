  Description :)

  I think this one turned out to be a bit easier than ev16-119,
  but I think part of it is I already had the practice on this
  map.  That megasphere grab can be very frustrating for me so
  I didn't get many chances to beat the record with it.  I also
  have a 1:22 that doesn't use the grab, which I was quite
  surprised to see.  I think on a very fast run it may be
  possible to beat this without the grab but you will probably
  need the grab to beat this.  This demo will also play back
  perfectly with final doom.
