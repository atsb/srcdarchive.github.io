  Description :-)

Istvan did this map the first time :

Istvan > It is the first time when I survive the level,
          
         Yeah me too :)

Istvan > so there is a lot room for improvement, but I have no time to do it... 

         Sure there was some :) => 3:23 faster :)) but under 3:00 is possible
         cause' i played very safe.

         This map is easier than many others cause there are lots of health and
         big weapons. Very few gunners too....
