Description :

Under 4 minutes would be nice here ;)

The map isn't really difficult on Nightmare, but it does have a few
annoying parts. The beginning is fun, but can be frustrating if the
respawn factor isn't in your favor. And no, I can't aim....but I'd
like to see YOU shoot a Nightmare-speed Demon with a Shotgun while
the thing is running from side to side =P

Fun map to do on Nightmare though, despite the very few frustrating
areas. My reference to frustrating is the area between the Blue Key
and the Mastermind ;) That was where I basically died, almost every
attempt ended somewhere between there. I had very few exits during
the hours I played this map....but even still, this was quite fun ^_^

The ending is frantic, as I'm trying to get to the switch to lower
the exit teleporter, while I've got Lost Souls and Demons chasing me,
and an Arch-Vile frying me and I think maybe a shotgunner shooting at
me all at one time @.@ Very hectic. Also....I nearly eat a rocket via
Lost Soul charge from the Pain Elemental >.< Wouldn'tve been pretty.
Luckily the thing teleported away just as the rocket would've hit him,
so I was lucky there ^-^

This also gets 100% secrets.

Um....I guess that's all I need to say. Enjoy the demo ^_^
