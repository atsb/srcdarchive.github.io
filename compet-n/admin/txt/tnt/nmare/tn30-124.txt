===================================
Description: Well, I got bored at around midnight and decided to do another run for the sake of it. And well I have
been thinking of seeing if going 1:24 is possible on Nightmare seeing that Nightmare doesn't really differ much from
the UV-Speed. Well what do you know, 1:24 as my time, guess I pushed it even further as I decided to just rush the
hallway near the end without worrying so much over Lost Souls. Well that is a second worth saving.

Now here is a good question, is 1:23 possible? Thing is, given that there are some hungry Barons who might hit me
and of course spawning enemies that might screw the autoaim system, well I don't think I want to bother again, and
this time, for real. Also when playing this on DOS, I thought I didn't press the switch at the Icon of Sin, but I 
did as I saw the stairs raising. Maybe if I didn't stop to check, I could have gotten 1:23, but probably only
barely and even then I would have the autoaim targeting at spawning enemies anyways. Then again, I would like to be
proven wrong, oh so wrong...
