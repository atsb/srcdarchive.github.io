Description:	I thought first I would have ammo problems after the first
		Spectres, but with twice the shells it wasn't. The yellow
		key is hard, as it was in every difficulty setting, even if
		it doesn't look so, the rest is concentration. I think this
		is a medium to hard Nightmare map, much health, one critical
		scene where you should be a mouser (to close the door at the
		yellow key)
