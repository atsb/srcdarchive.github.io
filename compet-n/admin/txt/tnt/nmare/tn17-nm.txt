  Description :-) Phew!.. This level is easy in UV, but rather the
  opposite in nightmare, as always in nightmare a certain "Lady Luck"
  is needed, i.e. the right respawning patterns. One must have plus
  50% in health leaving the bluekey area, died in the redkey are
  twice after having about 10-15% coming there.. I thought it was
  over when the revenant respawned right next to me!!
