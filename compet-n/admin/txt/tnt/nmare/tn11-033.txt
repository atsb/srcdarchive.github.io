Description:


This is my 14th ever demo so there..

It's strange. When I first set eyes on this level (which
was about 3 days ago), I had found Nightmare incredibly
difficult. I simply could not make it through this level.
So I tried beating the seemingly optimal :20 record on UV,
and after a few hours, I got it. So, I thought, well why
not try for a go again at Nightmare!? So, after about 3
tries, I made it through with unprecedented ease. Yes, this
was a relaxed recording. I'm sure any of those DOOM gods
could make it in 22 seconds or so if they tried.. Well,
it's that simple, I guess. Thanks for downloading my demo!!
