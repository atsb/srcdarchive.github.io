  This map is a lot more frustrating than it looks from
  watching Peo's TAS demo.  There are a lot of places
  where you should be able to do it without taking a hit
  but sometimes it is hard to avoid getting hit and there
  is not a whole lot of health on the level.  It gets
  much easier once you reach the megasphere.  I screwed up
  at then end and I think I took more than a full circle.
