  Description :-)

Woops, some tricks needed to finish this map. Actually it isn't
one of the hardest (doable) fdoom maps on Nightmare, but it's
also not that easy. I made some unnecessary mistakes, especially
in the middle part and near the end where I was quite nervous
(reached it for the 1st time). The most essential part is from
the blue key switch, to the invisibility, I often died there, but
still compared to other maps, it wasn't really *that* hard. 
Watch out, one of my last recordings...
