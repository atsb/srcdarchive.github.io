Altima:  The text I wrote in ev25c008 should sum everything up. My view
         is boring, as I stand in place, not moving at all. It's included.
         for completion of the zip ;) I don't think a Coop demo is whole
         without both LMPs...8 is possible but with those Specters, who
         knows.... ^_^

OgreSlayR:  pretty good..might be able to get 8 but those demons arent
            cooperative
