===================================
Description: Well nobody has done a Nightmare Speed demo on MAP27: Mount Pain at all it seems, sure there was the
100% Secrets demo by Tatsurd-cacocaco that was at 4:00, but never necessary a CN entry for Nightmare Speed on this
map. Out of a little bit of excitement, I kind of jumped on that and decided to do another run and perhaps the last
time I'll be playing this map, I am really tired of replaying this map even if I am beating my own records with an
even shorter time for every successful run. Maybe if someone beats this time by 1 second I'll go nuts and do
another run on this map, but as it is, I had enough of MAP27: Mount Pain. On the bright side, looks like I have
set an example of how to get this map done fast, heh, guess all the dedication in replaying the same map has
really paid off. Now wonder if I can get 1:29 on MAP30: Last Call on Nightmare again...
