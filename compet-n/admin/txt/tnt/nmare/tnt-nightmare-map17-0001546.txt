Description: 
So many attempts for this one, sometimes you even die before you can run past the 2 imps by the exit.
It is possible to grab the invisibility through the door, hard to get consistent.
It is also possible to do this pasifist, which should save some seconds,
however you would need an extreme amount of luck, not only with all the enemies but with the glide as well.
