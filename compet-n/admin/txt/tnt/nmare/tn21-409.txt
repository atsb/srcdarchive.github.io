Description: Used Ancalagon's route for MAP21 on Nightmare in his EP3
demo, which was basically a pistol start for the map really. Skipped
the blue armor secret and some other bits, pressed the switch to skip
that pit, and used rockets effectively. My heart pounded for a second
knowing I somehow made it outside with just 1% health to spare. I am
also glad not too many monsters entered that teleporter into the room,
that can be a problem.

This can also help for a 100% Secrets run, just that there's the BFG
secret and that room with two medkits to keep in mind.
