OgreSlayR:  YES! I believe this optimal. I actually got a 19.02 and it was
            so close me and Altima were pissed. Glad I finally got it. We
            had a small debate wether who should run which half.

Altima:  I thought Michael might wanna host a Coop session for once ;) Once
         again, his superior running saves the day again =) And yeah...as
         he said, we did have a small debate over who should do what. After
         the poison area though, I don't really do much...oh yeah, I don't
         do much at all ;) I just jump into the poison thingie as it's
         lowering to try to shave off some time. Most of this is OgreSlayR
         running. Optimal? Most likely ^_~
