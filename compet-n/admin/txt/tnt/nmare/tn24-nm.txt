  Description :-) Thanks to myself for the route. A quite hard
  level, the start is just sheer hell! After you get the
  invulnerability (which can be hard), just hope that the Hellknight
  does not respawn and block your way in the tunnel, if he does, press
  quit and start over, then the invulnerabilty will fade away before you
  get to the bluekey, and there is not a chance that you will survive the
  2 revenants at the end..
