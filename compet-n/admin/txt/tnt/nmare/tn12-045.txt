  Description:

Easier than nm100s this, don't have to worry about that damn archie :).
Credit to Opulent here for the route used at the start - getting the chaingun
early helps when you don't need the RL. Easiest way to save time here would
be to ignore the chaingunner on top of the RL entirely, but he does have
a nasty habit of killing you if you do that. :)
