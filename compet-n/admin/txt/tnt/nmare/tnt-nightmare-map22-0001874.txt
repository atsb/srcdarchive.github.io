===================================
Description: Suprised nobody thought of doing a run on this map given how short and easy it is. Oh sure beating the
world record is pretty much impossible, but CNDoom doesn't really require beating the Compet-N record, so if
anything, finishing this map under 20 seconds is still something. I'll be honest, I find this map to be a guilty
pleasure for me, even despite the bad qualities. Although I will admit, it is dumb that you can finish the map just
like this, seriously I don't think any other official map in the Doom series just lets you skip any form of
challenge like this.
