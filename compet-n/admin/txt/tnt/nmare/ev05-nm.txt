  Description :-) Whoa! Not a very easy map to do in nm. As always
  after a hard nm map it is this nice adrenaline kick and arms that feel
  like jelly;-)) Thanks to Andi who gave me the last clues to this map,
  I died pretty close to the exit on two occasions (I actually died
  here and there a lot while working on it:). The key to solving this
  map is the invisibility and the mega-armour..
