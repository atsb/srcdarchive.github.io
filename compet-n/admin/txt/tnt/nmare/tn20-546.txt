Description: Rather crazy to think TNT: Evilution still has tons of things to improve on with its maps, some never
maturing anywhere close to say certain maps like Habitat or the obviously easy first map. After watching Xit Vono's 
demo, I noticed how in his run he had a lot of cell ammo to spare but didn't used the Plasma Rifle or BFG at some
points to help clear out some hordes of monsters, which could have helped made the run faster. There was also that 
he took his time in some places, and while there is a chance of dying by doing that, the second half of the map at
least has enough power-ups (with conveniently placed secrets) to help make the rush to the end easier.

Using the route that Kai have made (and Xit Vono have used), this run is to help fasten the route, although some of
the mistakes could have been prevented, like not revealing a secret wall soon enough or getting blocked by an
Arachnotron, though lucky me I survived that one. In the red room near the BFG, I tried to hug a crate near the exit
door to get the monsters to move to one part of the hallway in order to blast them with a BFG. The attempts in
doing that aren't always successful, though some luck makes it possible to get through with enough health. Getting
past the first half was the hardest part, but afterwards it's fairly straightforward. The map is still hard
nonetheless.
