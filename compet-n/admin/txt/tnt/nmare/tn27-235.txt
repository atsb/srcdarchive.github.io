===================================
Description: If all the mistakes have been cut off and all the tricks have been done (such as a linedef skip on the
lifts near the end of the map), 2:30 or lower is possible. But as it is, that will take a lot of luck than it does
skill and just blind rushing, since you have to pray the tunnels don't have you low on health or wasting time to get
some Imps out of the way, you have a yellow keycard with hungry hitscanners waiting to murder you away, and of
course, the last area pretty much pumping my blood in hopes I don't get killed and a little prayer on the Arch-Vile
to infight to save a bit of time, but that's very unlikely. Regardless, I am glad to have this time anyways, beating
my own time like this somehow always surprises me, but I guess I learned just how much potential Mount Pain has left
in breaking a faster time. Although again, that might need a lot of luck to do seeing that it's pretty much a blind
rush with how I have played, the chance of dying is pretty high as the AI doesn't always do what you expect them to
do, be at places you don't want them to be, and the most frustrating part, Imps that don't die to a Super Shotgun
blast as you would expect. Ah well, at least now I can REALLY say I am proud to have this time.

One last thing to note though, I feel cheated when I have 80% health and all of a sudden it's nearly gone by the
end and poof, dead. Well, the map is called Mount Pain for a reason I guess.
