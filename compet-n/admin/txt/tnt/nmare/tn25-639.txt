Description:   This run is completely dedicated to Peo... I watched his
               ev25nmx yesterday and thought, that looks rather easy.
               Turns out it *is* easy. Don't know why I'm the first to do it,
               certainly Peo could have done it easily without
               cheating. About the only major difficulty is making your
               health last near the end - sometimes things go wrong there...
