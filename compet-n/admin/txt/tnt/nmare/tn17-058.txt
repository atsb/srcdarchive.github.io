  Description :)

	This can drop at least another 8 seconds even 
  with the inviso and the blue armor...

  I had a cool run where the archvile popped me out of
  the slime and I died RIGHT on the invulnerability...
  but I overwrote that one about 2 seconds later.  :)

  I got (3) :59's, and I wouldn't upload a 1 second 
  improvement, except this took me along time to 
  finally get everything to come together.  =|
  Besides, maybe Vincent or Xit will strike back and 
  we'll see something truly fast.
