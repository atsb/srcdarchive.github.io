Description :

Heh, I got this only around 30 minutes after I uploaded the 4:04. Who knew? -_-'
This time around it was really easy ^^' I should've watched Jakub "method_man"
Razek's 1:58 UV-Speed, I would've known about the teleporter before. Oh well,
I got under 4 minutes at least ^_^ Basically the same route as my 4:04 as well,
I just used the teleporter ;) Saves around 5 - 10 seconds on that.

This one also has 100% secrets.

Here ya go, enjoy ^_^
