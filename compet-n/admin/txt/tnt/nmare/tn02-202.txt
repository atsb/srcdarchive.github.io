  Description :)
  
  This actually wasn't too frustrating, I only spent some time
  last night and this morning to do it.  My route is quite similar
  to that of stx-vile, although I don't bother with the medikit at
  the start.  It costs time, and doesn't really help much IMO.  The
  hard part is getting the key.  After that it's pretty much smooth
  sailing although things can go wrong.  Stx-vile had some horrible
  luck in his demo so I had no problem getting a faster time.
