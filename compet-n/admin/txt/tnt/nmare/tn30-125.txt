===================================
Description: I thought going under 1:29 would be impossible, but instead, I went even further than that, 1:25 on
Nightmare for this map! I was confident I had enough health so I skipped the second Soulsphere and Megaarmor of the
map, to which it did saved some time seeing that I wouldn't have to worry so much over my health as it is. And to
my best luck, I have killed the Icon of Sin quickly as it is, and even more crazy, I did a run faster than the
UV-Speed COMPET-N record (by 1 second that is anyways). Pretty much there is no other strategy than to rush and hope
you can kill that Icon of Sin faster than you can hear your character scream and die. And well, I did died but
so did the Icon of Sin, and with the time I have gotten, I can't feel any happier. :)
