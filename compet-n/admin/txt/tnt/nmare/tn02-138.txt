===================================
Description: One of the hardest maps in all of Final Doom, period. Just the second map in TNT: Evilution and already
it puts some of the hardest maps of the other three IWADs to shame. You pretty much have to pray on luck to go fast
and not die since in some runs you may have high health but you lose all the health in no time, other times you have
low health then the run seems hopeful then you die for whatever reason there might be. The last part of the map is
kind of easy compared to the other parts, well assuming you have enough health since chances are you will get shot
at by many hitscanners though I suppose that is expected. Really, the parts that bring the most pain is trying to
get out of the room with the Pinky Demons and Pain Elemental and trying to get the yellow keycard, since unless
you are lucky to survive, if by any chance say enemies respawn in the most unforunate of ways (for you), the run
is pretty much screwed from there.

On the bright side, this map isn't so long, but that still doesn't make it any easier, doesn't help that the later
Episode 1 levels of TNT: Evilution are even worse.
