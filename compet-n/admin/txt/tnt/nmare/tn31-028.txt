  Description :)

  I tried months ago to get 0:27 in UV but I only got one 0:28 after hours of
  trying so I thought that 27 is too hard. Today I wanted to get 28 in NM, and
  it only took me 22 minutes! Time's from the timestamp of the bat and the lmp
  I didn't get very lucky with the wallrun but the chair trick in this run 
  is the best one I've ever done :)
