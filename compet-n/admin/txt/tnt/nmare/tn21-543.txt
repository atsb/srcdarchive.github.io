Description: Not going for 100% Secrets was definitely easier, that's
for sure. With some health to spare, you can just rush the last part as
most monsters are just Imps tossing fireballs at you and you can dodge
most of them once you are free. That was a little too close on trying to
grab the Megasphere if I say so myself!
