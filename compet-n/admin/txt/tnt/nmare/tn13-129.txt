  Description :)

Peo:
>  Description :-) If some of the other maps I have done lately from
>  Evilution were easy, map13 was the opposite! Very hard map in NM,
>  also very enjoyable for the spectators, since it has more action

2:20 Ilya:
>Agree ;) Actually, I just used Peo's route with some changes
>(also I tried pass this map w/o machinegun and armor, but w/o success) 
>Time is not good, just under par :)

1:29 Ilya:
So good history! That is why I had fun to make the new demo. 
Well, not so good run but with the new route I can improve the time. As usual :)
