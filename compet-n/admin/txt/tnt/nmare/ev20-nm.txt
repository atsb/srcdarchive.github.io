Description:	That LMP looks like it should. Fortunately I killed that Pain
		Elemental. That damn Archvile made it exciting at the end. The
		middle part from the Berserk to the Supercharge is very easy.
		Okay, every map is easy with Invulnerables :) It's my last LMP
		for the next 2 weeks, I've got to sit down and learn for my
		exam. Doom on! I've got 2 other LMPs with times like 8:43 and
		8:33. I think not much went wrong here, so it's a good time.
