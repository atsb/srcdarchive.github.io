Description:	This map is fairly easy (okay, maybe medium :) except for the
		exit. You really need some luck there, e.g the Archie should
		stay dead. There is no place to hide on the lift. I wait before
		I take the RadSuit at the Mancubus, because there will be
		less monsters then on the side I run along later. Okay, this is
		really the last LMP :) For the next 2 weeks: Think I'll give
		the computer to dasa tomorrow :) There were two unusual things
		I used SSG instead of Chaingun at the 2nd corner after the
		Mancubus. And at the last door to the left there were really
		many Imps, normally there is none. And, if you ever try to play
		that map in Nightmare, you can take the blue key before you
		run to the blue door :)
