Description: I was bored tonight so I searched for something interesting to
             play...and I found it...:)). This map with those two tricks is
             just awsome. Why the hell you wasted two secs. to kill that
             revanant...it simplier just to pass him...ok you won't get it
             every time but hey two secs. is two secs. and besides that
             I like these tricky moves...;)).
             This won't be that hard to beat...guess 36 would be great here,
             maybe optimal?
