    First i tried Michael's route and made a 1:17 (10 secs improvement)
    and noticed that the survival rate at the end is higher than 1 in
    20, so i decided not to take sphere and armor :)  However, i wasted
    much time in the 2nd archville room in order to save more health
    cause now the cybie fight was really hard... The map is really good
    for speedruning btw.

    I've never been a perfect speedrunner so i'm sure below 1 min is
    possible :)
