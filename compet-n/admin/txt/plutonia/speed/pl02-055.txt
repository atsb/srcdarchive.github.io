Description: Hey, this was eazy ;))). Third time I exit. Well, couse I don't
             know maps first I played it a lot without monsters. I will
             do it like that in all other maps. Practice with -nomonsters
             helps a lot. Anyway map looks nice, only the begining is little
             boring ;))).
