 Description : I like this level - it has a LOT of big fights. The best bits 
               are escaping the first arch-vile ... just, mincing the 2nd 
               arch-vile, and fighting the cyber in "pandemonium". The end
               has a 1 in 20 survival rate .... - Dont you just love suicidal
               lmps!!! - The way I do it, reminds me of Daniel's first pe15
               with -fast monsters ... absolute carnage!! At the start I
               again use the pe28 trick.
               You waste time taking the soulsphere & mega-armour at the
               start, but Id like to see someone beat this time ... without
               taking them!! - the invisibilty actually is vital, but you
               never notice it while you're fighting.
