  Description :

  Hehe .. it all started really bad, got stuck 2 times ... so I thought I wouldn't beat Vincent's time
and was about to stop .. but then .. BAM .. archie jump shortcut ( I had already thought about it, but didn't plan to
use it ;) .. and the end is really incredible ( ok maybe not that much, but when I played it, I didn't believe what I
was seeing :)) .. slalom through hords of monsters w/o being able to fire ( damn automatic changing weapons :P ) .
  So it's 2 sec faster than Vince :) 
Around 35s would be cool here.
