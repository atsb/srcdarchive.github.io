  Description :-)

  Ok, done under 1 minute now...

  Running through like that has some potential problems, getting to the
  yellow key, getting through the hell knights... the start is boring, just
  waiting. So I did some nonsense ;-)

  When you go to the red key, don't kill the shotgunner or you
  might take his shotgun which will make many problems. This lmp, finally,
  doesn't have many mistakes...
