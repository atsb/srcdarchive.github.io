 I watched George's version, and I thought he picked up too much fight, so
I have some chance to improve it... and I got an 1:31 runing his route, just
not fighting so much. I replayed it and I recognized that I had a lot of 
rockets at the end... replayed again... I didn't used the rocket launcher at
all!!! so why should I take it?
 Keep this in mind, always think BEFORE you begin to record something...
