  Description :)

  My 1:16 was not perfect, so I improved it.  As you can see
  invisibility isn't necessary.  Those chainers go down fast,
  but without invis it's easy to get knocked off by a mancubus.
  Also I use a new strategy to grab a chaingun from the chainer
  cage so I don't pick one up going back to the blue door.
  Hopefully this is good enough Sedlo, cause 1:14 would be damn
  hard for me.
