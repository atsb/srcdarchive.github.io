Description:

	Sorry Ethh, I just don't like to lose points ... like most people I think :D
This is my second successful try, first one was 1:35, but I wanted to get under 1:30. 
I really don't like this level, one of plutonia's worst. It can be unfair, especially
when the two last revenants block your way to the exit ( I had an attempt where they
killed me a few inches from it :P ). Anyway, I wonder if we could find a way to make it 
possible on nm ...
