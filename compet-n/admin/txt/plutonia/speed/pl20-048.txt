  Description :-)

  It's hard to get a perfect run here because it depends mostly on 
  monsters, if they don't walk away you'll stuck, this one contains 
  only one chainguner close look, kinda ok.
  During the tries I got many 50 sec runs with minor mistakes, so I thought 
  49 will be fine for me, fortunately 49 never happend.
  It's always fun to beat the Compet-n leader, even if he is on vacation
  and he didn't made a serious entry :)
