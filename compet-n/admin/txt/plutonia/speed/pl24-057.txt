Description:
>hehe, I wonder who will beat me... ;)
 Mmmm.... looks like the answer was myself ;))
 Wow, 43s sec off my first entry, and with a new trick ! I feel good, god damn it :)   
 Funny thing is that I have just told Vincent I wouldn't try this route, since I found it too hard. I can be really stupid sometimes :) Now this level is REALLY interesting for speedrun (c'mon, guys, give it a try :). That's the first entry I'm really happy of.
 Vicent told me yesterday he had found another trick for the level, but wouldn't tell me which one ( grr.. you salopard de ta race :)) ... we'll see whether he'll be able to combine both tricks in one run.
.... that's the first archie jump I discover ... champagne !!!
Oh, and to finish, sorry for the mistakes, I was pretty nervous after my good start :))
