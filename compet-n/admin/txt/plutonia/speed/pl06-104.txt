  Description :)

  Stx-vile told me that if he could tie his UV time in NM
  then the UV time needed improvement.  It was certainly
  improvable, but I needed some work to get it.  The hardest
  part of this demo is to get both switches in the ending
  area.  Here I didn't manage to kill the revenant on top of
  the first switch so I lost some time.  I barely had enough
  time to get to the other switch.  If I had been a few gametics
  slower the switch would have been blocked off when I tried to
  hit it.  There's some little mistakes in this, so I think under
  1 minute can be done.  At first I checked out the rocket jump
  to the red key but then I realized that it was more important
  to focus on the 2 switches at the end.
