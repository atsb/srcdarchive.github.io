  Description :)

  This demo was pretty old but anytime I can beat a Sedlo demo
  I can feel good about it.  Sorry about killing that revenant,
  I've had some troubles trying to pass it but anyways with
  this strategy it doesn't take that much time to kill him.  The
  ending went pretty well, sometimes it's hard to kill those
  chainers and stuff in time to switch to the rocket launcher
  early enough.  End rj is easy.
