Description: Umz, ok...I'm only uploading this cus those slow over 1 minute 
	     entries here are just too bad. This was my first 15 minutes sesion
	     survival lmp, and it looks like something a dog left behind on a 
	     pavement. So maybe I should have saved myselfe the upload.		

	     0:47/48(?) should be humanly possible with the same route, tho 
	     speedrunning this map dosn't tempt me at all, its basically 
	     unoptimizable and luckrelated and leave nothing to little
	     of demo replay value (which basically is the only thing I'm 
	     looking for these days...)
                          
             
             [To playback this lmp, you'll have to run plutonia.wad 
             together with Doom2.exe]
