Description: 
Obviously this could be faster...
well, Sedlo does a 17 second run on UV-speed, so a lot faster.
Unfortunately the second arch-vile jump is a bit too difficult for me :)

I skip the megasphere and save 2 seconds.
This run is a bit to frustrating to do for a better time using this route.
