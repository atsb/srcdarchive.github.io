Description:
Entry #13, keeping track for seemingly no reason.

This map can be irritating to run.  The archvile and yellow key may not
rise sometimes, the monsters beyond the yellow door may block the way out,
or the cyberdemon will react too quickly.  All in all, this was improved
by a comfortable margin.
