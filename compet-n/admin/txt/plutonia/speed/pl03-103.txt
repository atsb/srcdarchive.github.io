  Description :)
  
  This demo actually sucks quite a bit, but I hate this map alot, and its luck based
  and I happened to get lucky here, before I get really aggravated and crap heh.
 
  Special thx to Anders Johnsen for being the little Norwegian Gremlin behind the
  scene ;)

  this map should be easily done under a minute if u get a very lucky run.
