Description:  One of my favourite Plutonia map. It's kinda classic one,
              I like it very much. I made a few mistakes at the end. Maybe
              I used SSG too much, also saved more than 100 cells, damn.
              Anyway, this is my fastest demo. The route credits go to
              Kai-Uwe Humpert.
