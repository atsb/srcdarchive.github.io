             Whooaa! :)))
             
             Hehe, fx just told me that txt I was writing few secs along
             is something like bible, and I deleted it. 
             It's eazy to get annoying in txts after you make thing that
             excites you so much. Now I'll simply congrats Cameron for his
             neat trick and also I'll thx lucky bird for giving me chance to 
             add this extremly hard trick into my collection :).
             Hope you'll apriciate this demo, couse I did remarkable thing
             imo...besides beeing first one who did this in normal play 
             I also beated tas demo for 2 secs :).

             Is this txt short enough fx???  

         fx: "Ok, fuck off bitch...this is short enough. I hope noone will fall
              asleep after this one since with last one that would defenetly
              happen."
