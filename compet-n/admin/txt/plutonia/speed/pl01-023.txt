Description: This jump Anders showed me last year...I think it's finnaly
             time to show it to everybody. Guess I'm the first one who get it
             one try in normal playing. Very hard one. He sent me tasdoom demo,
             time was 20 so this is definetly not an optimal time...
             I will try later again...
             Hmm...this plutonia war is interesting....maybe I join Vincent &
             Selim in it...:)).
