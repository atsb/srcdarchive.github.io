  Description :-)

I just made it on NM and thought, well Daniel always takes a map
completely (but I don't like 100/100). So use your knowledge of the map
and get another point. First I wanted to upload a time around 1:15,
but I wasn't too satisfied (:-) Why ??), however sth like 0:55 should
be possible with perfect play... (some small errors incl. for free :-)

Ah yes, and please use normal mouse drivers if you beat it ...
