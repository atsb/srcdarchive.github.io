  Description :-)

  Hi again :).

  First I must also thank fx, great trick man.
  I was with him when he did it for the first time, my thoughts then was
  "what a lucky bitch", but now I can't belived that I thought even
  for a moment that this trick is hard. I get it 10 out of 10 tries now, 
  only thing needed is head close and knowing the right angle.
  Had 11 times 8, 8 times 9, once 10 :).
  Enough bullshitin, hope you'll like the demo...see ya.
