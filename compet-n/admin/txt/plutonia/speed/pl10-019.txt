  Well, when I saw that Sedlo's pl10-020 was actually a 20.51,
  I just HAD TO look into it and see if 19 seemed possible.
  It did. This look me longer than my 3 previous speedruns,
  because it required a lot of monster co-operation, and was
  therefore not a lot of fun to play since one was dying most
  of the time, usually at blue bars or redkey like Sedlo pointed
  out in his txt. I would also get blocked more often than was
  cool. I used no s50, although I woulda done so if I had found
  a way to use it to any benefit.

  I now have at least one speedrun for each IWAD for the update. :)

  Thanks go to God for this talent!
