Description: Sorry guys, I never thought it would be possible, but it was.
	     Take the red key and leave the area without waiting. 2 seconds
	     advantage. Maybe this map could be done one second faster, but
	     I spent 2 hours on it and don't want no more. Archviles DON'T
	     trigger the lines to open the doors, btw. So may way should be
	     the fastest indeed.
