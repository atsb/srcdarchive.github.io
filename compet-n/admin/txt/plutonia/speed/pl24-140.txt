Description: Yessss !!! Finally I found a route and some tactics that make the level not too hard. I first got 2:53 on the level, and it was incredibly hard (especially
 the beginning). But,after some map studying, I discovered this route, and soon got 2:03. But the demo had many mistakes, so I decided to give the map a few 
more tries. 
mmm... made this way, the level isn't really hard, but it can't be a bitch if you are unlucky. Here I had quite much luck, since the archies and the cybbie decided to be nice with me this time ( hey, thanks guys ;)). Oh, and the baron can make you fall down too.
 I don't think the inv is needed here. The problem isn't health, but those damn archies that always make you jump and fall down.
hehe, I wonder who will beat me... ;)
