  Description :)

  This isn't particularly fast, but what's good about it is
  that I managed the rocket jump to the exit.  Nevertheless,
  I expect Adam Hegyi to beat this soon.  It would be possible
  and quite a bit faster to simply jump to the exit without
  killing any of the monsters or grabbing the mega.  Of course
  you would not exit alive, but that's ok.  Now it's time for
  Nightmare! skill.
