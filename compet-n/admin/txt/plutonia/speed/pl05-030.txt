  Description :-) 

	Hmm beats Istvan's plutonia done quick by 2s :)

	I took the route i used for Nightmare! (pn05-034)
	with plasma gun in hand it's a lot easier to take out
	monsters on your way :)
	The other route is theorically faster, but you have worse 
	weapons and you lose some time to take them out.
	
	Sedlo : wanna try 0:29 ? certainly possible
