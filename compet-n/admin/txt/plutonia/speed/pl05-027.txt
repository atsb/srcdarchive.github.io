Description:
Entry #12, I hate letting maps go already. :)

Another 1 second improvement, I am slowed down at the final stairs, but
I don't think I lost any time because I managed to kill the chaingunners
before I get there.

(I don't know how to check demos to 0.01 seconds, like I've seen some
people do at compet-n)
