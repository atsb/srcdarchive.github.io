  Yeah...

  This came quite easy... It's kinda awful compared to Kai's LMP,
  because I used the bug which doesn't release all the arch-viles
  INTENTIONALLY. So I can run without having to avoid the archies.
  Much easier.
  
  Though I haven't beaten this time even with -nomonsters, one more
  second seems possible.
