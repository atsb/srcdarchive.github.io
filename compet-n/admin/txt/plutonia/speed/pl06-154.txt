                            ------

  Used the same route as Istvan did, with some minor improvements, the largest
  being in the blue key room - just shoot at the barrels w/ the rocket launcher
  from far away and the monsters do not wake up until you're down in the pit.
  I don't imagine how the barrels surrounding the blue key exploded - if 
  someone figures this out, drop me a line :)

  Btw, this is my first COMPET-N entry so it should be very easy to beat it ;)
