Description:
"Oh, and thanks to Anders for the little yellow bars tricks :)"

thanks to vince for the original new route.

which i'm to improve as you can see but i have had such a hard time
finishing it at all i decided to upload my first make it on the ftp,
at the risk to degranulate the competition.

i dedicate this ([for me now] success) to the victims of the cowardly 
terrorist actions that took place this 11 september 2001.
