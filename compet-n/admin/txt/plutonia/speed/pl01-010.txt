  Wow !
  I tried to do this after watching 38_VITa_38 nomo. 
  I known about the Looper's TAS demo but I wasn't able to do it in dos.
  You just need to have Y pos beetween -400.09 and -400.12, then a perfect sr50 to get the wallrun and perform this trick.
  0:09 should be possible but I'll not try it ... feel free to improve that :p
