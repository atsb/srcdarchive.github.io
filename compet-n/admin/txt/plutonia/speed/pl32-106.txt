Description: Now this is what I call a map with action!! Great route
             Andrey :-)

             Note: Cause Final Doom's exe cant handle the joyb_speed31, I
             used the originall Doom2.exe (1.9). So, to get a correct
             playback of this lmp, you'll have to run plutonia.wad 
             together with Doom2's exe...got it? :)
