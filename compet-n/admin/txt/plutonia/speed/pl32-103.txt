Description: Hehe, Anders told ya that I will beat your time ;))). 
             Maybe this will change your opinion and you will
             start to play again (you sed that you will defend this one).
             It's a shame that such a great player is retired, don't kidding
             me, grab your rusty old mouse and start with action ;)).
             I want a fight with you on this map, so I left plenty of space
             to improve, who knows, maybe with a good fight we can put it down
             to 50 sec.....but I know one thing that either you or me win, it
             will be pleasure to compet with you.....I'm waiting.....

             BTW. This map is the "number one" in Plutonia, at least for me.
