  Description :-)

	That's the first time i beat Anfrey Budko !
	But because i've found trick.
	The Arch-Vile was very annoying when waiting for 
	the lift to take the teleporter... (see Andrey's great pl16-028)
	So i though is it possible to jump directly to the teleporter ?
	
	Then i tried and tried ... and got this one.
	Not very optimized cause the jump is so hard to do.... keeping
	archie's attention on you is quite hard... :)
