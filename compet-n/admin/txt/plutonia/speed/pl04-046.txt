Description:
Entry #15, took a break from attempting maps 12 and 25 to run this.

I really enjoyed recording this one, a very nice map with a clever design.
This map plays similar to map 08, requiring luck with the monsters in tight
corridors, but it does make for a bit of variety.

BTW, I haven't been in #nightmare lately because my connection won't let
me on IRCnet for some reason.  If you want to reach me, either visit
#stickmen on irc.enterthegame.com or email me.
