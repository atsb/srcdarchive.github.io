Description:
My 9th entry, cutting the original time in half.

The trick I use at the yellow key is new, I assume, and it's a lot harder
to pull off than it looks. :)

After that, pray that the revenants let you pass..

P.S. Adam Hegyi sent me an email requesting that I use my real name, so
that's what I'll do from now on.  Sorry for the inconvenience, Adam. :)
