  Description :)
  
  Hi again...:)
  
  Originally I started this session with plan to make 7, to finish job 
  I started way ago. But during the precess idea about 6 was born.
  I knew it's possible and that it would be optimal time.
  Enough reasons to go for it ;). 
  It all depends on archie actually, since trick isn't so hard if
  you know the way. Heh, and here it is, my pal archie cooperate
  perfect this time and my reaction was good in that messy situation
  after tele. 6 on end screen was so sweet, can't describe you :) 
  but some of you probably knows the feeling. 
  Anyway, hope you'll like the demo, cya.
