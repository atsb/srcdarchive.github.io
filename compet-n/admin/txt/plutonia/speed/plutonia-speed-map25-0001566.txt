Description: 
Failed pacifist attempt, only attempt that went sub 16. 
Since pacifist is pure luck or not I just can't be bothered to attempt again for now.
I lost some time after hitting the switch when colliding with the walls,
but with all the attempts that I had I don't think I had a faster glide than this, 
I also think the rocket jump was very quick, so I don't know if sub 15 is possible, 
if it is it would be very difficult.
