  Description :-)

  Nice trick by DL, and it's quite easy to do...
  Still some room for improvement, 0:25 or 0:24 may be possible.

  Note: Because Final Doom's EXE can't handle "joyb_speed 31",
        I used the original DOOM2.EXE (version 1.9). So, to get a
        correct playback of this LMP, you'll have to type:
        DOOM2 -FILE TNT.WAD -PLAYDEMO WHATEVER
