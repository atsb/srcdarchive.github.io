Description
Luck-based and irritating run. Had a 53-54 run that failed because I couldn't jump down onto the raising bridge. This was damn lucky, finally instant glide. Almost thought that I wouldn't make it because the imps, once again, didn't let me on the bridge, was so happy when I did. Really happy to get under 50 (only had 1:00 and 1:15 exits before this one).
