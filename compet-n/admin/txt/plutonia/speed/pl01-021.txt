Description:


This is my 18th ever demo so there..

Boo yeah!! My first record recording outside of TNT -
Evilution!! :D ... I think I've mastered this trick as well
as anyone can master it. I make it about 20% of the time
now, as opposed to about 3% of the time before!! So, I've
figured out a great strategy for making this jump, but I'm
not going to tell any of you jokers how!! :) ... So yeah..
A triumphant day for me! A great return after many weeks of
absence. An EXTREMELY difficult recording! I went a bit off
the beaten road, mind you!! A much different path, bravely
venturing WITHOUT the rocket launcher. Mind you, I don't
seem to save too much time doing that!!

Anyway, thanks for downloading my demo!! :-b
