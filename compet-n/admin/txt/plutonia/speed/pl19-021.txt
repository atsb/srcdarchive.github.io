Comments: 

I'd dismissed the exit glide as a waste of time, but just
half an hour ago I found myself trying it again out of 
insomnia and sheer boredom. To my amazement I got a 3:22 
... then 1:21 ... then 0:53 - obviously this was leading 
somewhere ;-) 

So not so useless a glide after all, in fact it works 
almost immediately in this run, though the time could be a 
bit better due to bad running and snagging on the walls. 
But I think I'll wait till someone beats it before trying 
it again...
