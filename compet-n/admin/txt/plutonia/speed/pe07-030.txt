Description: Kind of funny way I found!
	     It is actually possible to make the jump without the
	     "extra" hight from the platform, It's very hard though
	     I only made it once with strafe50 and -nomonsters..
             Think this level is rather nice, however that "Archvile-
	     thing" can make you crazy...
