Description: Adam wrote that one more sec. seems possible, hehe guess he
             was wrong ;)). Well my nomonsters time is 52 but I know that
             51 is also possible and it would be then optimal time for this 
             map. But I want to try some others, Plautonia is just great
             for speedruning ;)).
             PS. Adam, 52 will be hard and it would only force me to do 51 ;).
