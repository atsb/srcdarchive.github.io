Description: 
Really big shame about that glide, I was very lucky to get in the perfect position so quickly.
I discovered several months ago a consistent way to do the glide, and in order to not walk past the gap 
you need to take 1 step back, but I messed up by walking forward from the start so I missed the glide.

Also cacodemon was closer to the elevator which means I don't have to kill him.
I also think I only needed to kill 2 of those spectres, but it's sometimes hard to locate all
the spectre locations quick enough to know if you can ignore them or not.
I was kind of hesitating once I got the glide and went through the teleporter, 
should usually fire a rocket right away at the imps, so luckly I didn't get stuck in barons\imps.

This might be the map I have spent the most time on in doom, which was for my 30pl runs, 
though at least 90% of that time was spent figuring out the glide.
I think this can go as low as 42.xx, you might need some luck with the spectres\cacodemon and a faster glide.
