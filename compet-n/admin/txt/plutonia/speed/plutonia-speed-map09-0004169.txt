Description: 
Well, in pl09-045 I wrote I thought this could go as low as 42... 
Turns out I was very wrong, 38 seconds should be the minimum I think
with instant glide and going straight from switch to RL\teleporter in RK room.

Good rng with the spectres, only had to kill 2 of them.
The glide could always be faster, but this was pretty good, managed to get the
right angle and position quickly, a bit slow on getting through.
Sometimes you don't even need to use vertical mouse movement, but it's very rare.

Last room is always very scary, sometimes the rockets don't hit and the chaingunners
just do their thing, or maybe even a manc pushes you off.

In 30pl2523 I got 1:08, so plutonia movie can still go much much further.
