  Description :)

  I don't like this level at all (why? check out the scene
  where I get stuck), but as I created this small trick on
  it ages ago and still haven't showed a speedrun of it,
  I grit my teeth and made it.
  
  Pacifist as well.
  
  This is my 378th entry, with this I have overtaken
  Demonlord, finally.
