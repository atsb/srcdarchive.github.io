Description:
This is my first entry for compet-n, so I hope you enjoy watching it. :)

This map was probably not a good choice for a first entry, but there was
previously no entry for it, so I thought I would open the way for future
runs here.  I plan to try improving it myself after it is uploaded.

There is definitely room for improvement on this map, my performance at
the blue key is the proof. :)

It takes a lot of luck for the monsters to cooperate on this one, the
mancubii hallway could have been faster, and it's also possible to dash
to the switch in the room beyond the blue door without killing the
cacodemons and pain elemental.  But, everytime I made it to that room 
alive, I felt the risk was too high to try it.
