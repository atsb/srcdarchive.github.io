  Description :)
  
  After recording this demo the dos prompt crashed so I
  was quite happy to see that the recorded demo was there.
  Things went pretty well in this demo.  Often one does
  not get enough kills simply going through this route.
  I also got the 2 kills I needed in the death room.  This
  is certainly beatable, but at 38 seconds faster than
  Radek I'm pleased to make this demo.
