===================================
Description:

Fun level, and I thought Archy's demo could use some improvement. This is still improvable as well (on my best start, for instance, I had 24 rockets after killing all of the mancubi), but I'm happy to have under j4rio's max. I got a 1:35 in about 40-50 minutes, but I wasn't satisfied since it looked rather ugly.
