Description :

Ryback's demo...jeez...I didn't think I'd actually pull this one off!! His
1:22 is simply AMAZING!!! O.O I highly recommend you watch it as well!

I had SO MUCH trouble beating his run that it wasn't even funny, my best
before this one was a 1:23 with 100% kills!

Not much to really say about this recording, except that this demo was luck
all the way through... ^^'
