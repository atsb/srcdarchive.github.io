  Description :)

  A great map, and respawn is a good style for it because you
  don't have to worry about killing every one of them like you
  do in fast/tyson/uvmax.  Instead you have to count to 18.
  This could get annoying if you speed it up to the point
  where you kill 2 or more archies in the exit room.
