  C-N entry #23.	Date:02/22/2012

  Description :)
  It's a shame the record was only 2:40, this is way to high for an iwad.
  But with that being said, this was not easy and PR32FAIL.LMP was a
  pretty discouraging event. However, I'm glad it happened because it
  pushed me to go way faster than what I would've done. Once I recorded
  PR32-229, I would've been satisfied and instantly submitted it to
  /INCOMING, but after PR32FAIL happened, I just couldn't except getting
  anything higher than 2:15. Now I have 2:04, 36 seconds faster than
  Jakub Razák's PR32-240.

  After I achieved my PR32-204, I was thinking about submitting PR32-229 as
  a C-N entry and then after that, submitting PR32-204 to get two
  C-N entries in a day but that would just totally be ultra cheesy
  and stupid and juvenile and childish and just down right against the
  spirit of COMPET-N so I'm just including it in this ZIP file for all you
  people to ignore for eternity.

  But anyways, something that's interesting is that normally, I watch the
  record I'm trying to beat over and over again, analyzing and studying it
  but this time, I hadn't watched Jakub Razák's or Altima Mantoid's demo.
  After achieving PR32-204, I watched Jakub Razák's entry. What's funny is
  that his strategy of killing the Mancubi at the beginning of the level
  was what I at first was doing, but later I decided to do it after I got
  the blue key.
  
  Ahh, under 2:00 is so defiantly possible it's not even funny. Maybe even
  1:4x with some good monster infights.
  
  P.S. Andy Olivera, Jakub Razák's PR32-240 is no where to be found on DSDA.
  Not even in the /compet-n directory.
