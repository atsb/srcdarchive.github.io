Description :

Vono's 3:58 before this wasn't bad, and I know it's not hard to beat my old time I had (5:29),
I will admit I had some problems beating Xit's time.

I STILL think the hallways are ugly.

And I don't know how it's possible, but I got LOST in the hallways towards the Red Key!! HOW
I did that, I'll never know >.< I lose about 15 seconds this way ^^'

Anyway, this map is one of those from Plutonia that I like ^_^
