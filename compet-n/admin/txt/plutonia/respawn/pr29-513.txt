Description :

I've been wanting to pull this off for quite a while, but never got around
to doing it ^^'

Had a 7:58 that I was going to upload, but Anders was like "It should be
faster than max" and so the max is Henning's 7:13. I decided that I could
do that, so I tried and got 6:23. Was like, woo, yay, nice time. I watched
it back, found out there was a LOT of dead space. So I thought I'd speed
the route up.

Here ya go, 2:05 faster than max =)

The ending was really bad, I died a lot there...chaos, carnage, and things
going boom.... muahahaha! XD

Best time was 5:01 with 97% kills, so under 5 minutes is possible ^_^
