Description :

1:43 sucked. Plain and simple. So after over a year of having some trash
like that as a standing record, I got bored and came back and beat it. I
had a 1:05 last night, but it just didn't sit well with me. Then just
after only maybe 30 minutes or so, this pops up ^_^

And yes, oh yes...I was lucky with that Cyberdemon. He was aiming just a
little too high... =P
