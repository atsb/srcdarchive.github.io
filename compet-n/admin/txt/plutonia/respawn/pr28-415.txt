  Description: vdgg recently did a lot of work to compile an up
               to date list of Compet-N records across all IWADS and
               PWADS, and looking at it I saw an old record of mine
               in a very glaringly bad time of 7:58. Hence this demo.
               A bit more of a push on the speed and under 4 minutes
               shouldn't be too hard, but this'll do for now.
