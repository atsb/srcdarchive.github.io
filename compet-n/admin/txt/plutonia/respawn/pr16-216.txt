  Description :)
  
  This is a nightmarish level on -respawn if you follow the
  UV Max strategy. For three days I was banging my head on 
  the wall, only to die twice next to the final teleporter. 
  Once I managed to climb on the pillar next to it, but at 
  the last moment slipped off. 

  The longer you try a particular run, the more likely you are
  to observe some weird s**t. Here I've seen both Arch-Viles 
  teleporting to the Blue Key area, both Arch-Viles teleporting
  to the Yellow Key area, and the last batch of Revenants and
  Mancubuses altogether failing to teleport (twice).

  Then today I saw the Yellow Key trick, and realized I was
  trying to tear down an open door. Without the two Arch-Viles
  in the open, this run is much easier. My first exit tonight 
  was 2:43 and 112% kills; so I decided to tighten up the ending
  and run fewer circles around the Rev+Manc horde. And at the 
  very last moment I realized I wouldn't make it to the Red Key
  switch, which imparts a comical flavor to the the last few
  moments.

  As for the secrets, there are none on this level.
