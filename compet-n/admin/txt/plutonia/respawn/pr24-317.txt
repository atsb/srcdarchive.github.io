Description :

Heh, I remember trying this one back when I was a keyboarder. Like...a
really long time ago. Only got to the Cyberdemon area twice out of around
100 attempts back then.

I picked it up today, and the first hour and a half of this map, I was
being slaughtered like a newbie >.< Then I kinda figured out what to do, and
so I get to the second half of the map, and I'm being slaughtered much
more brutally than before. Fortunately, I wasn't stuck at that part of
the map for long, as I finally found a safe route to finish the map in
this style ^^'

Basically, survive til the second half, then use the Plasma Rifle all the
way until you grab the remaining secrets. Now that I've finished this, I
would have to say that this is more frustrating than it is difficult. The
only real worry is that one Arch-Vile... -_-' He will go across that
ledge you raise and through the door and proceed to flame you from
basically anywhere in that room o.o'

I can't argue with the time either. After working on this off and on for
over a year's time, 20 seconds faster than Hegyi's max isn't a
disappointing time in the least. And this is my first successful exit,
mind you. I had a 4:01 with 85% secrets once, but hey...that's not
exactly successful ;)

Anyway, I hope this demo is enjoyable ^^

On a side note, today is my 18th birthday! ^_^
