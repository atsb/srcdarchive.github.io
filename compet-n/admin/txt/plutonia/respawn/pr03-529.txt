Description :

Nice level, but the hallways are ugly. I have a hard time navigating them.
I think they're designed for a mouser personally, I just can't move that
well in them. It would be nice if they were a little wider or something.

I didn't expect the Archie to follow me into the secret area...I was a tad
bit nervous when he was in there with me...kept hoping that the Revenant
would stay dead...which he did. I got some help in killing the Archie due
to the Chaingunners. I guess they didn't like him there either ^^'

This isn't my first attempt at this level, but I do know that most of the
time my deaths were in the Blue Key room. I just kept screwing up in there
and I'd die. I died once at the end, but only because I got sandwiched
between two Chaingunners that respawned at the exact same moment -_-'

Oh well....I got it done at least ^_^'
