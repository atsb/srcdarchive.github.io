Comments:
Nothing much to explain except about 1 ½ minutes in. At the invisibility part, I used rockets so that I could use plasma to get revenants out of the way when I'm getting the blue key. At the barons part, I just wait until the barons get out of the way, and then I go ahead. After that, it's just killing the enemies using the rockets and cells I have left and killing the chaingunners to get 100% kills since there aren't that many places for enemies to pile up for me to kill.
