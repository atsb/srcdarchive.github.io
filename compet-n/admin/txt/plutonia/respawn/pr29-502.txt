  Description :)
  
  Hey this was fun.  I'm not really an expert in -respawn demos,
  but basically I just go around killing stuff with rockets and
  plasma.  I should probably try some more respawn stuff.  Altima
  was right of course that under 5 minutes is possible.  If I didn't
  fall down at the yellow key area I probably would have made it,
  but hopefully you'll enjoy this anyways.
