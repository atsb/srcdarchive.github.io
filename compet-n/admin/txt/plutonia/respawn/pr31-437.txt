  Description :)
  
  It's annoying to try to go through this map without killing
  the cybers, but it's basically no harder than a speedrun
  because the other monsters respawning doesn't really make
  much difference.  I didn't bother with the rocket jump, which
  probably could have saved some time but I felt this was the
  safest way to do it.
