Description :

This demo was total accident. I was only playing to see if I could actually do it,
as I had never played this level before.

1:43 isn't a bad time in my opinion....

The reason I say this is an accident is because...I don't kill that many enemies. I
don't know how they all died...

Enjoy ^_^
