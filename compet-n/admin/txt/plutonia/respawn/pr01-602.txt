Description :

My first Plutonia demo. I couldn't believe that this wasn't done yet, so
I thought I'd fill the gap.

Had problems getting the Red Key a few times, that was my usual dying spot.
Once I got past that, it was fairly easy, except when the Revenants started
giving chase.

Health problems at the end....10% isn't enough to make due in a Plutonia
-respawn run -_-'

I'd say this level could go as short as 2:00 in this style. I just got this
done so it would be there, I could definately have done better on it.

Oh well, that's done, time for something else.
