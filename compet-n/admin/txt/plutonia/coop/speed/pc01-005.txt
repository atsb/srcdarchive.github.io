Description :

NB : this is a re-run. We did 5 seconds a couple of days ago, but later realized that we did not mention "-skill 4" in the command line, so that first run was recorded in skill 3. 
We're sorry about that, this one's the final run, enjoy =)

[ JC : ]

yeah !! 5 seconds ! Two days to get this result ! our lowest time was 6.11 so we had to do better !
a very good teammate ! =)

[ Dislogical : ]

Pretty hard run, took us some time to finally get 5 seconds (after several tries clocking at 00:06). 
Thing-run at the beginning was crucial to get this time.
