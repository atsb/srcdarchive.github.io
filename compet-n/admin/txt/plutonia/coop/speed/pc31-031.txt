  Description :-)

	Another old coop demo I dug up.

        We a use here the cool coop trick found by Altima.
	We just played a bit faster and I implemented 
        a pl17-like death slide in the end.
   	Archie was kind enough to play the famous role 
        of the Wall :)

	I got stuck here and there, so I guess under 28 is possible.
