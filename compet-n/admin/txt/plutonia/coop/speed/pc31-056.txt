Altima:   I noticed this trick while playing around on this map, then I looked
          at it in WadAuthor to see what raised up the stairs and figured that
          much out. Dashiva made a great partner in this map, thanks man. Under
          a minute was really nice to see! This was also a Pacifist entry

Dashiva:  This is a demo, you watch it with a doom2.exe. It plays back and can
          sometimes be concidered entertainment. You know... That reminds me a
          lot about evolution. Like, you get these monkeys and slime and flying
          and stuff. Pretty cool shit. Hey, speaking of slime, there is slime in
          this map. I never got a chance to see it though. :( So much for a tour
          of the map. I feel cheated. Well, you know what they say. You are what
          you eat. That must suck for today though, I can't remember eating
          anything really good.

  	  That reminds me of this time I was hanging out with TJ, he was like,
          "Yah, cool" and I looked at him and was like, woah, that was cool, he
          was right! This guy is a fucking walking encyclopedia. Brilliant shit,
          really.
