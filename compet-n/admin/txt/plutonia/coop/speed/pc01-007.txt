  additional comments:

	[df]:	I'd like to thank Vincent & Nicolas for the suggestion
		and Adam & Waldon for the nomo demo (and for
		the _execution_ :)
		Well, we beat Adams and Waldons time by one second, 
		and Vincent & Nicolas by x seconds. Yeah, we own,
		perhaps it's time for your retirement Adam ? :PP
		PS: We were talking about Selims recamming lmps while
		we broke this demo.

	[ethh]: this is a cool way to end the netherlan 2002 party.
		it's very calm now in here and we made the 7 seconds
		run while chatting about doom2 done quick and stuff,
		repeating our route automatically. i think we were pretty
		much relaxed and that it helped us concentrate on
		the player sync.
