Description:
player 1: Erik 
player 2: Torn

Erik:
This could easily have been 29 if the exit slide was faster or if I hadn't get
stuck on a demon. Much room for improvements in other words.
   
Torn:
I got the robot movement, press switch, etc. This type run is annoying on zone, 
would have been better on LAN
