  Description :)

  Hmmm, earlier I thought this was a great map for tyson, but
  now I'm not so sure.  I think it's quite annoying to try to
  find all those archies.  Definitely I think it was worth
  improving my old time.  To do this you should count the
  number of archies dead, and when you get to 14 you should
  then go for the exit.  77% kills maximum, unless you can
  punch one of those last 4 out, but that's not necessary to
  be a proper run.
