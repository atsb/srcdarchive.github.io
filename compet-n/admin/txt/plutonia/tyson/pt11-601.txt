  Description :)
  Aww, yet another record on my favorite map in The Plutonia Experiment. I
  mite get a record for this map in all eight COMPET-N categories... but I
  doubt that as I do not enjoy playing UV or MN Speed though watching them are
  quiet enjoyable epically when they do the whole episode, or better yet,
  the full game. But anyways, just like my PF11-244 run for this map, I did
  not intend to brake a record, and actually, this is my first time getting
  out alive in this level with just my fist wile killing all those sweet
  little monsters than I just wanted to cuddle with all day. But in all
  seriousness, this is easily beatable. When I first did this and realized it
  was a record, I quickly made sure that I did not fire off thy BFG at the and
  as I normally shoot it off in glory, because that would make this demo
  invalid for the UV TYSON category in COMPET-N. Another thing is that My
  rout is slower than Tatsurd-cacocaco's but I abuse SR50 like usual and there
  for it is faster. Plus, I am much more aggressive than Tatsurd-cacocaco was
  but he could easily beat this and probably will, just like the HR17-622
  indecent. This demo demo was record just after I replaced my 6 month
  old AA batteries for my wireless logitech mouse and it made it vary
  sensitive and since I don't use NOVERT.COM and I do not use the option in
  DM015.COM that acts like NOVERT (Except on maps were the slightest vertical
  movement in the mouse can kill you such as Level 24 - THE CHASM in
  DOOM2.WAD), so I awkwardly jerk forward or backward a lot. Oh, and one more
  thing, this is my first (and probably last) C-N entrie for UV TYSON so don't
  expect much more of these.

  [Btw, 77% kills is maximum on this map (in UV) with out going to the exit on
  the right and with out the "-respawn" parameter.]

  
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 6:18 by taster-cococo.
