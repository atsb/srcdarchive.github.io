  Description :)

  Ok, I gotta tell a story to go with this demo.  I fooled
  around with savegames and found that this was not too bad,
  so I decided I'd attempt it for real.  Then after a few
  attempts I get a ok run that is 17:21, which is an ok time.
  It was 100% kills, so I played back with timer to make sure
  it says 0 alive, but then in the middle of the demo it starts
  going crazy saying things like PAUSE and Green is Turbo.  If
  you try to playback a TASdoom only demo with doom2 you'll know
  what I'm talking about.  Then I tried timedemo, with the same
  problem.  Then I just played back normally and it had the
  problem too, so the lmp file must be bad.  Probably I ran out
  of disk space while recording.  Anyways I was quite pissed
  but I carried on and after a little while got this.

  I had much luck in the red key area, getting the archie to
  revive the same chainer at least 10 times without hurting
  me or the archie, but finally I killed it.  Anyways I don't
  think I would have any use for more bullets.  The blue key
  area, as it usually is, was quite annoying in that the PE's
  took a very long time to get around that wall so I could saw
  them.  BTW, Timer plays correctly until you get near the end.
  It will go down to 0 monsters alive, and then the player
  falls down and wanders around until the demo is finished.
  Enjoy!
