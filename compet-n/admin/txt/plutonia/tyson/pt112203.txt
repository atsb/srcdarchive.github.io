  Description :)

  Oh boy, this is a fun map, and it is extra fun to do tyson
  style.  In this case I run to the exit pacifist style,
  because pistol and non-berzerk fist are too boring to
  kill all the monsters with.  Then I run back and kill all
  the monsters with a berzerk fist.  77% kills is maximum
  here, becuase there's an alternate exit loaded with
  arch-viles and that special sector at the end of
  e1m8.  Similarly, you don't have to kill any of them
  just as in e1m8.
