  Description

  I had practised this one for some time with Zdoom.
  After I got the first exit in 23:01, I switched to
  the original exe and started recording. PC speaker
  and strange mouse settings caught me off guard, but
  after only a couple of tries, this happened. It's
  not very hard, if the monsters cooperate. There are
  lots of bullets and healing available.

  Thanks to Xit Vono for inspiration.
