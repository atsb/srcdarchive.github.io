  Description :)
  
  Your demo was not bad but it was kinda boring so I
  thought I would try to see if I could do it faster.
  Sorry that my demo isn't very fast.  I think I could
  have saved time if I tried to punch more spiders
  and saved the bullets for the revenants.  Also maybe
  it would be a good idea to try to punch more of those
  revenants on the way to the blue key, but that can get
  dangerous.  Anyways just keep playing and you will get
  more controlled movements so you can punch mancos and
  spiders.  Some of those TNT tysons of mine need
  improvement so go for it.
