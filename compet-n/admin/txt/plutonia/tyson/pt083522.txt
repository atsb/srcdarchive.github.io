  Description :)
  
  This was pretty hard.  I discovered a way so that you
  only have to punch out 1 baron, so that makes things a
  bit easier.  In the past I would punch out a mancubus or
  2 but I decided that that was too boring so I used
  infights for the first one and tried to pass the rest.
  It's really quite annoying when they block the route back.
  After that there's the chainers, which mostly just takes
  luck.  Things got pretty hairy when I couldn't get down
  the lift, but I survived anyways.  This demo is long and
  has boring parts, but if you like tyson demos it's well
  worth the wait.
