  Description :)
  Like Tatsurd-cacocaco's demo but more aggressive, still, this is not a great
  demo and could still be beaten. I think under 4:00 is possible with TAS and
  4:20 - 4:30 without TAS. Also, I must apologize to Tatsurd-cacocaco for
  spelling his name wrong in my last demo, PT11-601.

  [Btw, 77% kills is maximum on this map (in UV) with out going to the exit on
  the right and with out the "-respawn" parameter.]

  
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 6:01 by me.
