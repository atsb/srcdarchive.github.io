C-N entry #105.

This wasn't too difficult, although a bit
irritating at times.  The first part is a
quick run through the level to reach the
berserk, then go back and cleanup the monsters
that haven't died from infights.  The second
archvile fight is more luck than skill, as his
position is rather tricky among those other
enemies.
