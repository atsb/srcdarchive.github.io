|                                                                        |
| All 32 Plutonia maps contain only 16 berserks and 4 chainsaws, which   |
| explains why most of them are so bitchy in the Tyson category.         |
| Xit Vono filled some gaps, including seemingly impossible MAP10 and    |
| MAP14. Then z0diac (and Aqfaq) took over,challenging even more extreme |
| levels, such as MAP09. This level... has been just overlooked (and, I  |
| must admit, also by myself). Only the recent discussion involving      |
| odysseyofnoises and j4rio "forced" me to take another look at it.      |
| One of these "no berserk, no chainsaw, no chance" maps, but... only    |
| at first glance. It is easier than Requiem MAP06, for example, and     |
| surely much easier than at least half of z0diac's Plutonia Tysons.     |
| On my second day of playing I was already close to finishing this.     |
|                                                                        |
| Finished with 36% health, so health is the main problem, though ammo   |
| can also be lacking, it depends on which monsters survive in the end.  |
| Obviously, the ones which definitely need pistol ammo are the          |
| arachnotrons, then cacos (those which cannot join the battle). Well,   |
| let's stop this chatter, watch the demo only if you like this kind of  |
| stuff.                                                                 |
|                                                                        |
