C-N entry #77.

Xit was wondering why I took so long to
defeat the mancubi in my previous run. I
explained that I was a wuss and unworthy
of the title "Grand Mastah Mancubi Slayah."
I took some steroids and hit the bag for a
while before attempting the run again.  I
hope this demo will please the sensei, AKA
the Grand Poobah of mancubi abuse.

Another note: those spectres are terribly
hard to see against the lava and metal
textures, so I struggle to finish them. :/
