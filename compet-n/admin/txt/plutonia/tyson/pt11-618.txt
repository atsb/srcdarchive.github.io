Description:

Very exciting! Hunted is one of my favorite maps.
This map is quite suitable for Tyson style, so I enjoyed it.
Arch-viles moved to other areas while I went to take a berserk pack
sometimes. It is very troublesome that I look for arch-viles who
aren't encountered on my route. Of course, I didn't intend to do it,
and I only stopped recording a demo if it happen.
Btw, 77% kills is maximum on this map.
