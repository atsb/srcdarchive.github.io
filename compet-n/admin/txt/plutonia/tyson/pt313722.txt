  Description :)

  This demo is kinda like a pacifist run except you gotta punch
  4 cybers at the end.  Well in this demo The revenants killed
  the last one so I had to punch out the revenants instead.  It's
  kinda funny how I deal with the last cyberdemon.  Cybers killed
  the mancubii, no problem :P  I'll just use a hell knight.  Cyber
  shoots at hell knight, no problem :P  I just hit the hell knight
  and lure him into the BFG room.  I had to think that up during
  this run.
