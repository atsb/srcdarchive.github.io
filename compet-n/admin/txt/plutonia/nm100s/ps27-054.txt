C-N entry #98.

As with pn27, credit goes to Adam Hegyi
for the yellow door trick.

You get a whole minute of invincibility
for this run, so the only trick is to tag
the sectors and run to the end. :)

BTW, my table-filling, demo-recording
frenzy is over for now.  I will try to
attempt the last of the ps runs (12,23,25)
but the chances of any of them getting done
are still a question of time..

Also, Sedlo said he might attempt pn12 with
the trick jumps, since several people have
asked him to do it.  That would finally
complete the plutonia nightmare speed table!
