  Description :)
  
  Just one demo this time. I was trying ep01 but that last
  imp is so annoying. I should get it soon anyways. This demo
  is fairly difficult, but mostly at the beginning. I found
  that it's necessary to have a little luck with the bridge
  to get a good time. Here you can see that I fell down so
  I probably lost a few seconds there. To finish the map
  you have to avoid getting blasted by the arch-vile or stuck
  on the revenants. It's kinda funny to watch as the arch-vile
  is about to blast me and then I get hit, but not up into the
  air. I suppose it could have been the hell knight.
