Description :

Below 1:25 would be close to optimal, if not optimal, imo ^_^

Used Hegyi's route I think here, until you go back to the Plasma secret, then
I went back to it shortly after....and yes, I still have the cool thing where
I follow the Cybie's rocket out, there's a nice view of it ^_^

The only problem with this demo is that I missed the Yellow switch, and that
might've cost me one second, but other than that I don't see much more to
improve here in my opinion...

This route is VERY luckbased ^^'
