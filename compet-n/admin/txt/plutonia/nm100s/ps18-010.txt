C-N entry #87.

I am not the first to do this one, this run
is too easy to be undone. :) Selim gets 100%
secrets in his pn18-016/pn18-013 runs, but
he was unaware that they counted as ps runs.
Credit for the route should be Selim's, then.

9 seconds should be possible, although I didn't
check the time to 10.xx accuracy.
