C-N entry #94.

This run is irritating for a number of reasons,
but mostly because some secrets are rather
stubborn about registering.  The final two
secrets also give the monsters plenty of time
to weaken you for the teleport to the cyberdemon,
but luckily he was distracted and didn't see me. :)

I think the secret to watch out is after the hidden
teleporter (the revenant room with the 200% armor,
ammo, and soulsphere).  There are actually two
secret sectors there, and the one surrounding
the teleport pad may have been the troublemaker.
