  Description :)

  This is my first Compet-n Entry :)))))))
  
  When I saw Xit Vono's record (0:58), I thought I could beat 
  it easily. And yes ... 
  
  0:58 came at the first try :)
  0:57, 0:56 was done also easily
  0:55 took me 30-40 minutes.
  This 0:54 is a result of hours of work. It is a bit ugly, so
  it was a big surprise for me. I had many smoother runs, but
  none of them reached 0:54. Interesting ... :D
  
  As I have seen Sedlo's UV run, one fact is sure: my run is 
  very far from optimal :D. 0:50 could be possible.
