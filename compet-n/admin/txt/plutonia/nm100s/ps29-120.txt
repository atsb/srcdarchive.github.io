Heh...kay. Um...I go to load up Doom, expecting a tough time taking
this back, and I get this on my first try...this is ugly, only because
I wasn't warmed up. But anyway, I continue to try and I keep getting
times of 1:21 and 1:22...so after about an hour, said screw it, and
kept this one... oiy, my luck... -.-'

By the way, I like how I have 3% health at the Megasphere, and then
grab it and am immediately hit...kinda like I shoulda died but didn't.
Oh well, die another day as the say... ^_^
