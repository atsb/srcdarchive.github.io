Description :

I love this map...I had to defend my nm100s record for it :)
Nice job Vono on your 1:34, even if this is 1 second faster, I'm glad I
could reclaim it ^_^

This map is one of my personal favorite Plutonia maps, it's just...cool
in my opinion.

What's fun is when I chase the Cyberdemon's rockets out of the Blue Key
room...fun fun stuff ^_____^' And at the end, I guess everyone decided
I should die right then and there, so they get my health down to 30% or
so, but I live so I'm happy and stuffs ^.^

I am pleased with this demo ^^
