Description: 
 
      This is my first Compet-N entry :)))))
	  ... and hopefully it is valid now ;)
      
	  This demo has a short story:
	  
	  I made a 0:54 demo with prboom (I didn't know it wasn't
	  valid) and uploaded to Compet-n. I was informed about
	  my fault, so I had to give up with prboom and start playing 
	  with the original doom2.exe. Lots of thanks go to Myk for 
	  helping me to setup it. 
	  
	  
	  Something about the demo:
     
 	  Interesting that performing the switch trick (archies don't 
	  release) successfully (u would meet just with 1-2 archie) has 
	  been very rare in doom2.exe by me yet, despite in prboom I 
	  could do it almost every time.
	  
	  Therefore I met a lot of arch viles, who really didn't want 
	  me to finish the map. They always were in right PLACE in good 
	  TIME to wreck my recordings, so sometimes i was very nervous.
	  
	  That was very very very rare, when actually NONE of them
	  bothered me.
	  
	  So I needed much more time (more than double) to make this.
	  I have to get familiar with doom2.exe :).
