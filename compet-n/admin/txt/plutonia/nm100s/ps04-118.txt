  Description :)
  
  Even with the extra health this demo didn't seem easier than
  the normal route.  I same time on Stx-Vile by not bothering
  with the 2 chainers in the baron room, and I also get the
  armor right at the start, which probably contributed to the
  extreme difficulty because I usually run out of armor before
  the blue key.  I would say that this demo went extremely well
  based on the health and ammo I had.
