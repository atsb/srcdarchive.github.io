C-N entry #92.

This run isn't as hard as it may seem, the
secrets are bunched up near the end, and two
of them are very close to each other.  Once
again, I failed to implement the red key trick
and even got fried by the archvile, but the time
is much better than my previous 2:58.

I also got used to the trail of revenent fireballs
that follows me around during the end fights, haha!
