C-N entry #36, movie run #10.

I decided to start including comments on each level:

01: Short and easy start.
02: Another easy one.
03: Ditto. :)
04: One map where I take my time to ensure that I leave, since the crowded bridge can
    be trouble.
05: Short map, a nice megasphere for me, too! :)
06: A little slow at the end, but otherwise just fine.
07: My favorite "map07" from any megawad, this level is a classic. 
08: The first level I ran for C-N returns!  Only the archviles at the end can pose
    a threat.
09: An easy one where rockets are abundant.  The end can be hectic with the mancubi
    fireballs shooting everywhere.
10: Made the two jumps through the window, saving my health/armor for maps 11 and 12.
11: If you archviles wake up, this can be tricky.  I manage to keep most of them asleep
    in this run, though.
12: Probably my least favorite plutonia map, this one just reeks. :)
13: Tough to speed run, but I get a nice megasphere at the end for map14.
14: Easy if you don't rush, just get to the end alive! :)
15: A nice fillup map for cells, not to mention the two megaspheres.
16: This one can be hell if the archvile jump at the end goes wrong, fortunately
    I got to the exit before the revenants could run it and get me.
17: Not very tough, just a little cramped. :)
18: The archvile jump is pretty easy here, thankfully.
19: Not much trouble here.. don't mess with that cyberdemon. :)
20: Most of my attempts ended at the blue key area of this map, surprisingly.  The
    revenants and archvile love to shoot you as fast as possible here.
21: One of my favorites from plutonia, this can be a little tricky if you get
    surrounded.  I try to save cells for maps 22 and 23.
22: The archvile at the red key ALMOST ALWAYS fires the moment you step onto the
    platform, but I was fortunate this time. :)
23: This is a tough map if you happen to have low health.  I missed a switch here
    and had to go back, beh.
24: The archvile jump here is fun to use. :)  The cyberdemon owned me with a rocket,
    though.
25: The last tricky map of plutonia, low health at the start can mean trouble
    sometimes.
26: From here until the end of the game, it's nothing but easy levels. :)
27: I actually died here in one of my attempts, I missed the second invulnerability
    then.  This time, things went quite well.
28: Never any problems here.. the monsters swarm near the exit, but I break through
    without much trouble.
29: A simple run collecting keys and hitting switches here.
30: A relaxing way to end a 30 level run, sheesh! :)
    Took more shots than usual to take down the boss, but oh well.

Bet you didn't expect this, did you? :)

I plan to improve this movie ASAP, so enjoy this run in the meantime.  One final
note: yes, I did run the 3 episode runs as well; those will be uploaded in a few days.
