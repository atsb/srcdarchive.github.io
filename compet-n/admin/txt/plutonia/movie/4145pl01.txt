       Nice improvement over old time. This a 14 level run where
       I end up quitting after skipping a teleport line in map15.
       Check by yourself, I skipped the line and fell in an acid pool
       from which you can't get out (like the many other ones in
       Plutonia, thanks to Casali, not to mention the half-assed
       stupid coop support).
       This is far to be my best run for most of the maps, map09
       is my PB btw. I guess under 40 mins is to be expected in 
       the future. And 35 mins is within Radek's reach.
