C-N entry #42, movie run #14.

01: The run is 1 second faster already.. woo!
02: Same troubles as before here.
03: I don't like these hallways anymore than I did before. :)
04: Stumbled a little at the start, but still improved the original time by
    playing much less safe here.
05: Same run as before.. I like playing this level. :)
06: I think that this level is my favorite from the entire wad.  It's just a
    fun level to finish.
07: Another favorite, even if it's a short one. 
08: I favored a new tactic at the end where I eliminate the archvile/revenants
    on one side of the exit.  It seems like I can never exit without getting
    pounded.
09: Made a nice improvement to the previous time here.  The end of this level
    can still be pretty exciting. :)
10: Played less safe here by dodging the revenants rather than killing them
    first.
11: I've learned from experience that if the archviles wake up, your life can
    be a living hell.. I would waste cells/rockets/health/armor just trying to
    get out..    and you want all of that for map12. Thankfully, they stayed
    asleep here. :)
12: I actually tried a new strategy here that I didn't use even in the episode
    run.  It allows me to save cells I would normally waste killing the cyberdemon.
    I also perform the trick jump at the end.
13: The same run as before, only slightly faster this time.
14: The route I used in the episode run helped a lot here.
15: Another route unchanged, just played less safe again.
16: A little trouble at the end, since the archvile was off in happyland and didn't
    want to boost me to the exit.
17: Same route, only faster again.
18: Got the archvile jump on the first try, yay!
19: Played less safe once again.. that cyberdemon is still making me waste cells. :)
20: Had a little trouble at the end trying to get the barons to destroy the barrels..
    eventually just said the hell with it and did it myself, waking the revenants.
    I came REALLY close to death here. :)
21: Still shaky from the end of map20, but it went faster than usual. :)
22: Got beat up at the red key, but escaped without any major losses.
23: Didn't miss any switches this time. :)
24: The cyberdemon spared me this time, allowing me to stay very healthy for
    map25.
25: Wow, this time is a personal record for me here.
26: A routine run.. that megasphere kicks ass.
27: Missed the invincibility the first time, but snagged it before I got myself
    killed like in a previous attempt. :)
28: Same run, only this time the monsters stayed asleep near the end!
29: Same run again, only more confident than before.
30: Took down the boss faster this time. :)

Wow, I'm quite happy that I managed to get this run. :)
This is my fourth successful 30pl total.. the first being the 46:54, the second
a 42:26, the third.. well, the third sucked bad because map20 royally screwed up.
Enjoy the run, because I think this will be my last attempt for a while. :)
