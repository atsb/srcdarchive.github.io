01: Heh, the average time for this map was around 3:10...but as you can tell, the
    Archie didn't wanna die with rockets, and because I was running low, I had to
    resort to other weapons -_-' Otherwise, this was the usual run.

02: The average time and usual run here. Nothing went wrong really, just the end
    Revenants would sometimes deal some lethal blows there, but things went pretty 
    smooth here. ^_^

03: Bah....usual time was 4:45 -_-' I dunno what happened for this one to go as
    slow as it did here...and that stupid Revenant guarding the Soul Sphere wasn't
    stunned by my Chaingun...odd, he normally would be. ^^'

04: This is slow compared to my usual time, which is 5:30 or so. That Baron scared
    me while I had the rocket launcher...I mean, the thing teleports right in front
    of me! In my opinion, this is Plutonia's first challenging map for me.

05: Heh...umm....boy did things go really badly here ^^' First, I blast myself with
    a rocket, secondly, I come down to 4% health!!! And also, this is another map
    where I had a below-average time for me! Jeez the frustration!!! >.< And what
    in the heck was I thinking when I decided to pick off the exit Barons through
    the wall cracks? o.O

06: Heh...just slightly slower than normal, average here was 5:50, but a 6:07 isn't
    that bad for me ^_^ That Cyberdemon scares me...he's just in a bad spot, but all
    the practice from my ev31 Max-Kill demos payed off here, as I got the Cyber in
    (somewhat) close quarters and layed into him with the Plasma ^_^

07: Fun!!! ^_______^

08: The first of the "two evils" as I called them while recording. This map has no
    armor, so anything left over from pl07 has to last through both, pl08 AND pl09!
    >.< And I'm still scratching my head...I eat a Manco-fireball THROUGH the wall!
    Not much else to say though about it ^^'

09: The second of the "two evils" as I called them while recording. I only exited
    this map twice. The first time, the time was below 9 minutes and I stayed on
    the ledge...but I died in pl10 soon after -_-' Anyway, this map was probably the
    hardest one for me, as I just could NOT seem to stay on the exit room ledge, and
    kept falling off, which means that I should just stop recording...there's no
    getting back up once you fall -_-' Also, there is no armor until the end
    room...where you don't really need it by then...oiy. I used a totally new strategy 
    here in an attempt to stay on the ledge which I did. If you look close, when I'm 
    fighting the second Revenant, I STILL nearly manage to screw up and fall off!! I 
    could really care less about the time here, I just wanted to get out alive! >.<

10: This map gave me a few surprises...I used the remaining Plasma and Rockets here
    and the ending gave me some surprises when all those enemies started teleporting
    in when I thought everything was already dead. Those dual Archies really had me
    worried near the end, so I stayed hid in the Plasma secret and tried to pick one
    of them off...but I eventually run past ^^' Then the last set of teleporters kinda
    gave me a startle, and I run out of Plasma here. The exit room didn't worry me
    much, luckily it's pretty tame. ^_^

Well...I spent a good few weeks on this demo. Hopefully someone will spare destroying
this one before the update...I know the total time isn't good, in fact it could be a
LOT faster, but I love Plutonia and it deserves to have a Max-Kill movie on it. ^_^

I went fast in the parts I knew EXTREMELY well and other parts I went slow so I
wouldn't screw up. Although many, MANY times I did screw it up anyway ^^' Given the
large number of deaths, I still found this to be a fun demo to record ^_^

Well, I hope you guys enjoy this...and I hope it can stay a record until the next
update ^_^
