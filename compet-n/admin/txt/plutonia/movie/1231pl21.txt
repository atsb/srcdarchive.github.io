Beats the old record by quite a lot because shenanigans... again.
Pretty fun demo, when I did this I was mostly practising and doing an
occasional attempt at the ep run. When I got 2:08 in 23 I wasn't sure if
it was for real or just practice.

21: Missing the megasphere you'd get using the normal route can make 22
kinda nasty. Using mouse strafing the glide isn't that difficult because
you can position yourself against the wall (guided glide as opposed to
non-guided ones in 8,9 and 19).

22: The level with by far the lowest survival% on this run. This time
yellow key room plays it nice and the guys at red key decide not to show
up (that linedef is right next to the teleporter, maybe there's some
setup for skipping it?) which is sometimes pretty annoying because while
they're below the floor they still block you. You'd think it would make
getting the key trivial but first few times I saw that while practising I
got destroyed because I didn't know where they were and ended up getting
meleed to death trying to walk past them. Nice revenant rocket at the end
to make things more exciting.

23: Pretty fun level. At first I thought this is impossible but with 
enough practice it becomes pretty consistent if you get the invisibility.
If you don't, trying to get the glide with those chaingunners around can
be interesting. The glide doesn't really save that much time but it's
pretty easy so I much rather take my chances with it than the two viles
that come with pressing the switch.

24: Pretty meh all around, I lost lots of time on really stupid stuff.
Also lost the blue armour which almost kills me in the next two levels.

25: I don't do the little hop in the starting "room" which saves a few
seconds because I often ended up taking too much damage trying it. Can't
lose too much here so I can skip the blue armour which saves a lot of
time. That rocket jump is imo easier than either of doom2 ones but it's
still fairly nasty, especially if someone were to try it in 30pl (I bet
I'll lose at least one run where I make the rj and then the shotgunners
kill me in next map).

26: Feeling a bit under the weather after 25 I take a short detour for
medkits. Still get under a minute which is very nice.

27: Protip: keep shooting when entering "that" teleport. Lost a few
seconds for absolutely no reason (other than stupidity) but oh well.

28: The guys before exit room are here again but don't really end up
wasting too much time this time.

29: I don't even know what to say about this. Considering how much
plutonia can kick your ass in the first 25 levels (and I guess 26 if you
do the rj) 27-29 feel really easy. 30 isn't terribly bad either but I've
had some crazy stuff happen there, usually involving pain elementals or
getting hit by the cyberdemon for no reason.

30: This time I actually had a feel for timing the first shot and even
hit it. Yeehaw. I was actually just practicing this level before doing
the run.
