C-N entry #38, movie run #12.

11: An easy start level, just don't wake the viles and get out.
12: This map is cruel, but at least it's early in the movie.  Too bad
    Sedlo's jumps aren't easier, but I impliment another jump to the exit.
13: This one is tough to speed run because of cramped spaces.. that
    megasphere at the end is great for map14.
14: Can't perform my own trick here, it's too risky. :(
15: Easy to run, this is an excellent fillup level.
16: Managed the archvile jump at the end, for once. :)
17: Can't perform the trick here because it breaks the rules. :)
18: Easy level, just do the archvile jump right away. :)
19: A large cell supply makes this level quite fun.  The cyberdemon just
    gets in the way here.
20: This level can be tough if the jump to the blue key goes wrong, since
    fighting your way up to the top would most likely wake the revenants
    and the archvile.

Of the 3 plutonia episodes, this one is the toughest to speedrun, IMO.
The times before this were 17:28, 15:49 and 14:08.
