Fifth exit, third improvement. Finally got the sub 30 mins I was hoping
for earlier. There's still some total garbage play (map09, map12, map21,
map22, map29) and some awful times that weren't entirely my fault (map02
- most people would've probably reset at that but I just kinda roll with
it, you get to reset enough in  plutonia as is). Some weird decision
making - I wasn't sure at map15 if I'd go for the megasphere or not but
then decide not to risk it and waste a few seconds, and was going to go
for map25 megasphere after the failed rj until I realised I have blue
instead of green armor and have enough health for another try. I also
took a little break at map23 tally screen because I had my left hand in a
bad position and it was getting numb, heh. Bunch of exciting situations
at least, almost died several times during the run. There's still a lot
to improve here but breaking the 30min barrier feels pretty good. 
Shoutouts to Alexander Nikulin, Dime, fx, Looper and Vile as usual.
