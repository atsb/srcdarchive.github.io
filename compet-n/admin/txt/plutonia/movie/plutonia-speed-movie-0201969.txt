Description:
A good run destroyed by a very unlucky jump on map 12. Had I turned the smallest 
amount to the left or right I would have made the jump, but instead because
of a rare combination of position, speed and angle I failed it. I should never
have continued this run, but I haven't gotten an exit since 30pl2523 so I would
like to get at least a demo incase I ever give up on getting under 20 minutes.

Combined with a couple of other mistakes on map 10 and 15 pushed this above 20 minutes.
