===================================
Individual level times:
MAP11 - 1:05.06
MAP12 - 1:43.60
MAP13 - 1:26.69
MAP14 - 0:41.77
MAP15 - 1:00.09
MAP16 - 0:32.63
MAP17 - 1:59.94
MAP18 - 0:19.74
MAP19 - 0:37.60
MAP20 - 0:55.20

Beats the old record by quite a lot because shenanigans.
Looking at the times it's easy to say this could easily be under 10 mins (13 and 17 were
especially bad) but this is a pretty brutal run and lowish 10 is already kinda close to my
limits. I know I can in theory do sub 10 but it's going to require both good play and
especially good luck which plays a significant role in almost every level. There's only so
much I can put myself through while waiting for the stars to align for all the vile jumps
and monster positioning to happen while at the same time playing at my best.
