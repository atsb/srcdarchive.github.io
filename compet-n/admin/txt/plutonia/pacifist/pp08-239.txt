C-N entry #173.

Pretty tricky pacifist for the plutonia
table, and perhaps the last to be done
out of the ones that are theoretically
possible (pp22 remains and 7/30 are not
possible).  It felt like pn08 all over
again by allowing me to reach the exit
several times and having something silly
happen to mess up the run.  This time
the skulls were all over that blue switch
so I took my time. :)

Note that without firing, the chainers
at the blue key trap never wake up, so
you're free to take the key.  Also, you
can open the secret with the fist and
not wake them up for the extra health
bottles.
