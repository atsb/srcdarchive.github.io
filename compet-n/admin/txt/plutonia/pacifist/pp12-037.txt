Description :

Well, I needed something that would take a while to do, since I'm sick in bed with
nothing really to do but play Doom and such. So I thought I'd pick up pp12 again.

Been playin' this one off and on for a while. Originally I was gonna take the long
way and get the Yellow and Blue Keys and Archie-jump to the exit, but that is
insanely hard in my opinion. And it would take much longer on the exit time.

So I thought I'd use the Archie-Rocketjump here :)

Just one problem....THAT ONE STUPID SHOTGUNNER ON THE BLASTING LEDGE KEEPS GETTING
IN THE WAY!!! >.< Gotta get rid of him and then hopefully there won't be any monsters
within the blast range ;)

Anyway, enjoy ^_^
