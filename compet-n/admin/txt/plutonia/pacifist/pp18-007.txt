  Description :)
  
  This is a very old demo. I wanted 6 but I couldn't get a fast
  start reliably while not taking too much damage from shotty.
  Without a fast start I couldn't quite get 6. I think since this
  is a rather frustrating run I am unlikely to try it again, so I
  encourage anyone to improve this.
