  Description:

  I thought 5 seconds would be easy, but no. It took many tries.
  That damned wall is just a luck factor there. I think 4
  seconds is possible, but you must have the correct angle
  before you hit the wall and then you have less than
  half a second time to get past that wall. Good luck with
  running that time!
