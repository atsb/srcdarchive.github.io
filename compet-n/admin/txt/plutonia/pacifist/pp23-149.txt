  Description :-)

Wow, what a fun run! Much nicer than the others I've been trying lately :).
Vile has been doing his bit filling the pacifist tables, so I thought I'd
see whether I could do any of the undone pacifists. This looked like the
most possible, so I watched Vince's run through a few times then sat down
to try it. It's taken me a couple of hours or so, and it's just a complete
blast to play - really enjoyable. I get a bit lost at the end, heh - still
don't know the route completely. I think a really tight run could beat the
speedrun record. I haven't actually tried the faster route to the red switch,
I think it'd be too crowded to use. But I just wanted to get a run uploaded!
