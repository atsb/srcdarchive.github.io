  Description:  there are 3 annoyances in this map.
		1 - getting the yellow key fast enough so the elevator doesn't trap you.
		2 - surviving the 2 chaingunners when pushing that switch and on the way back.
		3 - getting past the baron by the narrow corridor.

 		The arachnotron by the mega also screwed up one good run by blocking me.

		this demo is far from perfect, crappy running and I even forgot
  		the route at one point. The only improvements over Ryback's route
 		are skipping the rad suit and the (mostly useless) mega.
