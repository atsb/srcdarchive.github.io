Description:

 Thought i'd play a few plutonia pacifist...saw this, got 0:46 on third try
 and wondered about the speed record =). 0:41 is certainly possible, but this
 can be a damn frustrating level. You can get in and out of that baron switch
 even faster if you get a huge serving of luck, just run straight for it
 almost as if the barons weren't there and hope like hell :). Speed and
 pacifist record.
