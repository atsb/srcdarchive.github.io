  Description: Quite nice :) I was actually trying to get back my pacifist time ( chris : sure, I do want war if u feel like :), and after 15 min of non serious playing I had 0:22 ... I told Chris on ICQ I had beaten his time, then I wanted to playback my 22s, but I launched the demo recording .bat instead ... I thought "Hey, let's play !" .. and I got 0:21 :)
 Hehe... I beat Sedlo's speed record at the same time ... I love those two points demos ;)
