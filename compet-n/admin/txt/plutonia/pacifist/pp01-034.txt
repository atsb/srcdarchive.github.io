  Description :)

  I'm very happy that I made this.  Getting all the chainers
  dead in this way is hard enough without having to make the
  jump.  The first time I missed the jump, then when I tried
  it again a mancubus shot me so when I made the jump I was so
  shocked I had to do a mad scramble to the exit, but hey I made
  it.  Overall this is a very lucky demo.  Well I think beating
  Williamson's 42 on the old route would be just as hard, so 
  this way I think you'll like it better.  As Yogi Berra says,
  "If you see a fork in the road, take it."
