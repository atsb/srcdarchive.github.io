        Too bad this is too hard to try again, otherwise
        I'd release a nice demo. Oh well.

        This will prolly desync with fdoom exes, I dunno,
        I record with doom 2's exe, so keep that in mind
        when you go, "Oh, Chris just went all retarded,
        he's trying to mate with the walls again."

        Again, so it's a recurring problem, eh? :P

        heh, :)
