  More than a year ago I got this and thought I'll go for 19 one day, but
  I won't be doing so in a long time, maybe never - redoing a
  simple and easy run and over and over again then waiting for the
  jackpot of luck with the archie isn't my idea of fun - so why not grab
  the two points before someone else does?  I'd like to increase my point
  count to a whopping 10 for the next update =)
