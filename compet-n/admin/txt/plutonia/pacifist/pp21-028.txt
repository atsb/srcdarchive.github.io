Description :

I tried for this one a long time ago, around April 2002 or so, but the :30 I had
then wasn't valid because a Caco was in the splash >.< So I never could upload
it.

The time on this demo came as a slight suprise to me, I was only expecting to hit
:29 at my best, but I'm happy with :28 ^_^

Vile's :34 was impressive, and the only way I even had a chance of beating it was
to use the Rocket Boost.

Too much faster would require a LOT of luck, because the boost is pretty much
luck-based whether or not you pull it off without hurting anyone ^_^

I'm happy, I finally got that lucky run ^^
