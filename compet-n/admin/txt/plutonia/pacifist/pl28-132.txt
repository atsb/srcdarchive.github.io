  Description :)
  
  The beginning part with the yellow key was so-so, so I decided
  I would continue to experiment with the blue armor.  I didn't
  managed to get the armor, although it didn't matter in this run.
  Sometimes health can be a problem, but mostly just with the
  chainers, so I wouldn't recommend the armor.  After that the
  problem is getting stuck by the baron or the spider.
