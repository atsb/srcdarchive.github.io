  Description: 

Well this one came amazingly fast on a horrible level...it's a couple of
secs slow because everything worked like a dream, but it was so early I
still wasn't sure of the route :). Tried for a while to improve it, can't.
Possible to use Sedlo's end trick - you can get the rocket launcher, just
dodge the imps or get the chaingunners to hit them - but it's very hard
(and probably tough to keep enough health that long).
