  Description :)

  I did 1:42 yesterday, and I thought I'd improve it because
  there were some mistakes in it.  This demo has quite a few
  1-2 second mistakes but it's also quite lucky in places.
  The red key room takes much luck to get out quickly, and
  also it requires much luck to get the invisibility without
  getting fried by the arch-vile(though I would have survived
  anyways)  Speed route is possible but very difficult.
