        Man... you have NO idea how happy this makes me.

        This is by far the HARDEST thing I have ever attempted
        and completed.

        Sedlo man, thanks a LOT for that rocket jump, without
        that this would have taken me a lot longer to do, and
        been a lot slower.

        P.S. This demo is shit, the only reason I upload this
        crap is because after 4 days of straight trying, I get
        one bloody exit. Sedlo, you may be a quake llama, but
        you're my hero!
