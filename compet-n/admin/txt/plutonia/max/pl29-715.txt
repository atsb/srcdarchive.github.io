  Description :)
  
  This demo is dedicated to Schneelocke.  He asked about a max or
  -fast demo so I made this.  It's quite an annoying map actually.
  There are many places where you can mess up.  In this demo the
  door didn't open so I wasted almost 20 seconds to retrace my
  steps.  I think the rest of the demo was pretty good though.
