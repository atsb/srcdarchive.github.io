  Description :-)

  A great map, except from one thing: YOU DO NOT place a mancubus miles away
  were it's almost impossible to kill him. The only safe thing to do is to let
  Mr Cybie handle him. But believe me, I had uncountable tries because of this,
  and that's why the demo isn't that great. You simply get tired pressing "q"
  after five minutes of (possibly :) great dooming........
