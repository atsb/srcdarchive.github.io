Description: Another lovely map in plutonia...this is only a 10s improvemnt
             over Adam H-s record. The thing that keept annoying me was that
             the archie that you are supposed to meet outside the yello-door,
             just isn-t there. He clerverly jumps in the teleporter right next
             to blue door. From this point you can just hit the restart button.
             Unfortantly this happend 50% of the tries...:(
