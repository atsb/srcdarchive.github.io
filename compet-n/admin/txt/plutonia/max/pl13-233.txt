C-N entry #114.

Thanks to Henning for his strategy.  This
demo resulted from a fairly lucky attempt,
afterwards I had a hard time just getting
below 2:40.  I thought my performance at
the end scene was messy, as I demonstrate
exactly why I hate the PE (the monster I
favor the least from any doom game. :)
