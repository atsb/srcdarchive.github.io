  Description :)
  My 9th COMPET-N entry for Hunted, this demo won't bring me pleasure
  though, my cat died earlier and February 15th will forever live in infamy,
  February 16th isn't too good either. My Olivia girl broke up with me that
  day.

  I've lost both my Olivia cat and my Olivia girl now. Olivia the cat lived
  to 21 (or 22), an outstanding age for an animal of her species. It's been
  a long time since I've cried but today brought the tears down my cheeks.

  But anyways, back to the demo, almost lost it at the end, good save on my
  part.

  If most people played other levels like I play this level, COMPET-N would
  be allot harder to compete in.
  								
  								
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 2:44 by me, timestamped:
  Thursday, December 22, 2011, 3:34:50 PM.
