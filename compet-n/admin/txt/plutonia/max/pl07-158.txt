  Description :-)

  Oh yeah, finally under par...
  A nice LMP by DL, learned much from it. My first succesful try of the level
  was 2:22 so I knew this won't be too hard. (Usually I'm far worse on my first
  tries.) 
  Hmmm... what else to say?
  This is a nice level, especially because it's MAP07 :)
  I like the title too...

  Note: Because Final Doom's EXE can't handle "joyb_speed 31",
        I used the original DOOM2.EXE (version 1.9). So, to get a
        correct playback of this LMP, you'll have to type:
        DOOM2 -FILE TNT.WAD -PLAYDEMO WHATEVER
