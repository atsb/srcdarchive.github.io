C-N entry #119.

Thanks to Henning for his run; I use his
route for this demo (I wouldn't dare to try
and find another one anyhow).  I played this
one rather casually, not worrying about the
final time and enjoying the gameplay.  I had
a little trouble deciding what to do at the
archvile/revenant room later on, with some
wasted efforts with the SSG, but overall I
like the way this one came out.
