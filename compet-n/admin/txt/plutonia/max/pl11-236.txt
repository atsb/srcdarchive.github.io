  Description :)
  I'm actually kinda disappointed about this, my PL11-237 looks so much
  better. That run had such a quality feel to it. I know most of you won't
  but if your reading this and enjoyed PL11-236, make sure you check out
  PL11-237 because you'll enjoy that one even more, or at least I hope so.
  
  But anyways, this is still a great run. Half the time I was blinded by
  fire but I know the map so well it didn't effect me at all. My strategy
  here was a combination of the strategy I used in PL11-237, but with a
  little more risk taking. I tried as much as possible to never take any
  brakes in-between shot gun blasts, in other words, as long as an
  Arch-Vile's in-front of me, I'm holder the right-click (my fire button) as
  opposed to clicking, then clicking again for the next fire. This means
  that I take cover less, and thus, must rely on the Arch-Vile flinching
  which is not very reliable, but it's what got me the record.

  Here's the text from PL11-237, it will make some of the things I discussed
  above more understandable, but to understand PL11-237.txt, you'll need to
  know what's with the failed PL11-237 attempt. The failed PL11-237 attempt
  somehow failed because the secret somehow didn't register (WTF!??). But
  anyways, here's my PL11-237 text file:
   "Yes!! Finally beat [well, tied :(] my failed PL11-237 attempt!!
    Took a slightly new rout this time, not sure if it actually saves time or
    not but it defiantly doesn't slow down the run.
  
    The trick here was to hurt the enemies but not immediately kill them,
    because in order to immediately kill them, you must stop and take some
    time out. But here, I hurt them a little, but don't take (too much) time
    to stop, instead when I'm trailing back after the yellow key switch has
    been clicked, that's when I finish them off.
  
    I must say, I'm quite proud of this one, looks like something SAV88 would
    record though don't tell him that."
  
  Ahh, my 4th PL11-2xx.LMP entry this week... I need a girlfriend.
