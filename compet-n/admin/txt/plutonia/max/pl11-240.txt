  Description :)
  Insane SR50, but it's virtually impossible to get on record on this map
  without using it extensively. I've been playing this map for a while
  trying to bring my PL11-241 down since it's 7 seconds slower than the
  UV -FAST record. I got a time of 2:37 but somehow, the secret didn't
  register so I'll have to settle for 2:40 for now.
  
  I think 2:32 is realistically possible without tool-assistance, but it
  would be very difficult and require not getting stuck while using SR50 and
  each Arch-Vile would have to die in four shots and you better not miss a
  shot if you want this time. I'll keep playing this map till I get a 2:37
  or lower, but 2:32 is for sure possible - but not by me... yet.
  
  I wonder if anyone, besides my self, will beat one of my Plutonia map 11
  entries... PT11-420 is easily beatable, the rest, not so much.
  								
  								
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 2:41 by me, timestamped:
