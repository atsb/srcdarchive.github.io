  Description :-)

  A beautiful level, but quite chaotic when playing for speed... I killed
  the "unkillable" chaingunner twice, once to get the kill for him and once
  to get the kill for the archvile, since he is truly unkillable, so I'd get
  100% kills. (Even 3 times still doesn't give you 101%)
