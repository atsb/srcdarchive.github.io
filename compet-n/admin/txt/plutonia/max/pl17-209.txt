  Description :-)

  IMO this is one of the best maps ever designed, my taste indeed. A dark brown
  team decorated with green slime summons the right atmosphere. Lots of strategic
  placed enemies, the chaingunners can be frustrating. My route here is pretty
  drastically changed compared to the one John Keniry used in his nice 2:59. 
  I think that 1:59 is very possible.
