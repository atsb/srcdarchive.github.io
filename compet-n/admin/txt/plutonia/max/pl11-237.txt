  Description :)
  Yes!! Finally beat [well, tied :(] my failed PL11-237 attempt!!
  Took a slightly new rout this time, not sure if it actually saves time or
  not but it defiantly doesn't slow down the run.
  
  The trick here was to hurt the enemies but not immediately kill them,
  because in order to immediately kill them, you must stop and take some
  time out. But here, I hurt them a little, but don't take (too much) time
  to stop, instead when I'm trailing back after the yellow key switch has
  been clicked, that's when I finish them off.
  
  I must say, I'm quite proud of this one, looks like something SAV88 would
  record though don't tell him that.
