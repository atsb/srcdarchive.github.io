  Description :-)

  GeminI made a nice improvement to Yonatan's old record. I found a better route
  and made this demo. It went pretty well until the end where I got a bit excited
  and wasted a rocket. I should have used SSG on the remaining monsters from
  that point, not rockets. But all in all I'm pretty satisfied with the lmp. It
  takes some luck to have a cybie-vs-caco fight rather quick. I could have gotten
  a really good time if the two BFG's in the yellow-key room had been
  more effective. It took me around four hours to make this demo, and 
  it was a pure pleasure. A very nice map with GREAT gameplay.
