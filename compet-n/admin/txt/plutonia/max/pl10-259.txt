  Description :-)

  This map is pure slaughter all the way. Lots of action going on, still most
  of the time you are quite safe in there. The only way you can die is firing
  a rocket into your face... those lost souls can help you tremendously doing
  that :) I really worked very hard to get under 3 minutes... had one 2:52 with
  100% faked kills (one chaingunner remained) which was near perfect. In the LMP
  in the collection the end got quite close, huh...
