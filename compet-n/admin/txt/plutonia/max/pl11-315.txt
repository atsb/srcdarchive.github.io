Description:
	I owed it to you, guys. Can you imagine that pure Ultraviolence is
	much more difficult thanwith fast monsters? There is still a 4 seconds
	gap to my fastest "GM" style LMP. You need much more luck with all the
	Archies, when they run around they are hard to hit from close range.
	I dunno if there is a faster route through the maze, but this way you
	have got the least trouble with Archies running out of their area.
	There are still some seconds left for improvement, taking the berserk
	was plain silly, you don't need to take the secret exit (somehow 2
	Archies died there, I guess one with me by an Archvile attack), and
	I collected all the health potions, you can leave at least the lowest
	2 or 3, that means 81% items. I like a 100 100 100 screen more, but
	that is impossible here. This is not the last LMP for that map, I
	recorded it in Tyson style (even without pistol), and because UV is so
	difficult, I added -fast in the command line. That LMP should be in the
	/misc directory in the COMPET-N site within the next year :)
