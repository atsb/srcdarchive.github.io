  Description :-)

  Ack! One of the least impressive maps in Plutonia. The sewer textures are
  awful, and those tunnels make you sick. The gameplay is good over the
  first four minutes (I especially like pumping those cells into those
  monsters). But then it's player's nightmare! There are two LARGE monster
  teleport places, and in 19 out of 20 demos you won't get them all teleported
  in in reasonable time. The 2nd teleporter is worse, sometimes it takes
  minutes for the last monster to finally come in! That's why my route
  there seems stupid with all the messing around, going from place to place;
  but it's still the best if you want to get under 6 minutes, heh.
  My best exit with 99% was 5:52, and it was VERY tough to have this LMP
  with 100% kills and under 6 minutes.
  So level design people out there: ALWAYS test your monster teleporters
  before you release your levels and don't let the monsters wander around
  trying to teleport in!
