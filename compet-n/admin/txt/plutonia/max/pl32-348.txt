Description: Do you know the strange feeling you get after getting something
	     you really wanted for some time, only to realize it
	     dosn't affect you as you expected? Think this is the case
	     with me atm...I really wanted to have this one sub 4 mins...
             For one thing TAS is 3:34 (that one with -fast, but with TAS
	     fast monsters are hardly a drawback in a slaughter map like
             this cus of the heavy infights), so I imagined sub 4 mins
             with regular play should be really cool. Well, guess its not
             too bad. After all it beats my old max with some 30 secs.
             Getting a 4:20 is no big deal at all, but cutting of those
             last 20 secs can be a pain. I really don't know why this one
	     got below the magic line. I expected to get a 4:10 or so...
	     When watching the lmp again tho, I realize that the ledges
             part went faster than it seems, despite me picking up that
             extra 200 sphere. And the rest of the map went w/o problems
	     at all. This was a pretty hardworked demo for a change, I hope
	     I'll be able to do something else now :) 

	     /me holsters the bfg and goes to take a well-earned(?) piss...
