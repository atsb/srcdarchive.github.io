  Description :-)

  I don't like this level, it's built nicely but gameplay is really bad, you
  can't play speedy without hiding, I must say though that the traps are
  nice... what I hated the most was the dark metal area, you can't see
  anything there. But I had to do it since there was no COMPET-N lmp for
  that yet.
