Description: 
I wanted to try something new, this is my first max demo.

I missed 2 early SSG shots, so that cost a lot of time. 
I also didn't kill anything with 1 of the rockets on the imps at BK.

I got lucky at red key area, getting PE and mancubus in 2+3 rockets.

I can see this going at least 3 seconds faster, but that seems to be very difficult.
At least it does for me so far, but then again uv-max isn't too different from uv-speed,
you still have to move and aim well anyways :)
