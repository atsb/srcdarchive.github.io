  Description :-)

  Ouch! Rather hard one to speed up. The start with all those shotgunners can
  ventilate you in few secs. 2'ndly there is this famous hell knight trap which
  usually leads to a certain death. Then there is that DAMN lava-lake with 
  hoovering painees and cacos all over the place. IMO that is the worst part- it
  forces you to play whimpy. Dunno if my time here is good or not, but after 
  playing this map for some 10+ hours I got tired. The design is not bad, I have
  always liked this kind of lava-theme...
