  Description :-)

  Not a favourite Plutonia map. Some good parts, and some awefully bad planned.
  The end is hard if you speed, I did it pretty slow in this demo. The rest
  went OK. I don't know if my route here is the best. In contrast to the 
  old Compet-N demo of this map, I return to the blue-key room twice. This
  because you won't have to wait for the monsters to teleport, and also cause
  you will get the imps aligned when you return to the main room.
