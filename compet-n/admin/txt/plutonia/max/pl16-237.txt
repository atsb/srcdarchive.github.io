  Description :-)

  A very small map with lots of action. I spent quite a lot of work on it,
  because the faster you go the more you'll die. My route is totally different
  from Daniel's old one, I really recommend you to watch his demo first before
  you see mine. Still some mistakes in it, but I had luck with the elevators
  all the time... The arch-viles can cause much pain too.
