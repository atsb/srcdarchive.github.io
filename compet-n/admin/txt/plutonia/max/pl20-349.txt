  Description :-)

  Another extremely well designed map with great gameplay. I really like the
  baron's room and the cages with revenants. The only bad thing while playing
  is that sometimes the second arch-vile teleports away from the
  main area and then you can restart the whole thing. Actually that's the biggest
  problem, once you finish that arch-vile it's pretty easy to the end.
  The only thing you'll have to pay attention is your rockets supply, don't run
  out of them till the exit because the revenant cages become very tough without
  them!
