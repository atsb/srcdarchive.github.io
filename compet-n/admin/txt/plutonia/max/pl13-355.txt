  Description :-)

  Another fun map, this one has some traps, the only dangerous one though is
  the one with the archvile and the chaingunners, fortunately I killed them
  and he didn't revive them a lot... Just wanted to get under 4 minutes, but
  this lmp has some funny parts, like the monsters fighting each other in
  the outside area, the chaingunner nearly killing the mancubus and then me
  helping them both win ;-)
