  Description :-)

  Now everyone knows how much I like MAP07s... so it was quite obligatory that I
  do this one. Not that it was a pain :) I really liked this one. Design is
  wonderful as always, and the layout of the mancubi and arachnotrons is nice,
  unlike some other MAP07s. Weapon placement is lovely too. Uhm, the 0:05
  improvement over COMPET-N is because the old record was my own :) the older
  time was top-notch too (2:05 by Daniel).
