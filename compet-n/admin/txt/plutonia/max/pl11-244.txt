  Description :)
  I’m a bit disappointed about this record. In 11/1/2009, I had my first
  COMPET-N entry, PL11-246. I was proud about how it had lasted for so long, 
  but now it’s broken... by me.

  God I need to play some other maps...


  [Btw, 77% kills is maximum on this map (in UV) with out going to the exit on
  the right or with out the "-respawn" parameter.]

  
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 2:46 by me.

  Utility's: Doom Mouse Spinner, you can download it @
             ftp://mancubus.net/pub/idgames/utils/misc/dms015.zip
             (Sorry if link is dead, ftp severs have a tendence to fail.)
