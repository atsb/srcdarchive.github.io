  Description :)
  
  One of my favorite Plutonia maps, also thanks to tatsurdcacocaco
  for telling me how to submit a C-N demo. Now of course this was 
  not an easy run, however there is still much time for improvement
  and i think it will be beaten again soon in the future. But i am
  still proud of this one, after all this is my first Compet-N demo
  :) 
  [Btw, 77% kills is maximum on this map (in UV) with out -respawn.]
