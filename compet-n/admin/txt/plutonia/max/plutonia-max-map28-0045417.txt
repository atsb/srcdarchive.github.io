Description: 
Monsters not teleporting in is by far the most annoying thing about this map.

Too many exits with 98% and 99% kills.

Some changes to the route, I grab RL earlier, use my cells a bit differenlty.

You can also grab a rocket through the wall at the first switch you press.
It only happened once (by accident), but it could be useful for the mega 
armor room (where I lost 1-2 seconds because demon survived and I didn't manage 
to grab the armor).

I also tried to do a trigger skip using a rocket boost, makes the BK room easier 
to clear when you go back, though I have no idea how the monster teleports can be 
affected. I might have wasted a BFG in the second to last room, not sure, but using
the BFG twice there might help with getting everything to teleport, I have no idea.
