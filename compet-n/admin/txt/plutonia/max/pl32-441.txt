Description: Nice...Thanx Goes to Adam Hegyi for the cell-tips. Maby I can
             return to D2-Max now? :)

             Note: Cause Final Doom's exe cant handle the joyb_speed31, I
             used the originall Doom2.exe (1.9). So, to get a correct
             playback of this lmp, you'll have to run plutonia.wad 
             together with Doom2's exe...got it? :)
