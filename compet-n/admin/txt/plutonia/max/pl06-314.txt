  Description :-)

  One of my beloved maps, I've played it for the gmcol, and the previous
  COMPET-N record was mine two. Since the lmp doesn't playback with doom2.exe
  (because of the different style teleporters work), I had to learn it again.
  While I played I remembered from time to time how I've done it before, but I
  guess I've changed some parts too. The Cyberdemon was easier than 
  expected, it was less frightening than some years ago, so I release him
  with the Revenants still alive. Could be that is the only place I am 
  faster than before.
