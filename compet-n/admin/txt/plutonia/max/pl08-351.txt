C-N entry #112.

Thanks go to Andy for his demo here;
I used his strategy for the blue key
chaingunners.  I wanted to try this
one after doing the nightmare run, and
it seems the basic idea doesn't change:
without armor, a single mistake can be
enough to end the run.  I totally miss
with the SSG twice, but the end went
well enough to compensate, I suppose.
