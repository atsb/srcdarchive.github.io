Description: After doing this map with fast monsters in 3:42 for the
	     GM-Collection (you have still not watched it? Why?) I felt like
	     I should record this on UltraViolence too. I think you can't be
	     better than let's say 3:15. Maybe I still use too much SSG. But
	     I can't change my mind, SSG is the best weapon for Pigs. Even if
	     it kills them slower than maybe Plasmagun and Rocket Launcher.
	     It is really easier here to kill the Cyberdemon without any trick.
	     Sometimes I die there because I am stuck at these damn poles. If
	     you ever design a map, don't place such stuff at critical places.
