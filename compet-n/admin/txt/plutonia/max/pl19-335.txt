  Description :-)

  Another great map from Plutonia, this was a lot of fun to do and I thought
  my old (5:19) lmp was way too slow, there is still some room for
  improvement but not below 3 minutes I think, I am pretty satisfied from
  the time, since I killed the archvile before he could revive anyone and the
  cyberdemon only with bfg (with other weapons it wastes time).

  The reason I go back to the start area twice is that I got 97% kills in a
  previous try and I didn't want it to happen again.
