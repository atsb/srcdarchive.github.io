  Description :-)

  Hmmm, a map with DOOM2 MAP29 style, much easier though. This map has one invul
  and insane amount of soul/megaspheres, you just cannot die :) I clean most of
  the first hall while the elevator is rising, also with invul and rockets so
  I can save my cells for later. The jump from the rising stair in the second
  hall is intentional, since I have to visit the revenants' secret I guess
  that's the most appropriate time... I guess my way of killing the cyber is
  fastest and easiest, it's good luck that the autoaim of the plasmagun works
  in that distance...
