C-N entry #120.

Thanks to Andy for his demo here.  This
is one of the few levels of any doom that
I have never played through completely.. I
believe the only other one was ev31 because
it lacked a certain key. :)

The gameplay is similar to av32, IMO.  It
was fun for a while, but relying too much
on infights to produce fast times made me
lose interest (no offense to Andy, who made
AV32). I tried to improve this one, but perhaps
this demo was too lucky for me to beat, or I was
too bored to stick with it.  I thought about
starting a small max pack for HR, so enjoy this
plutonia pack in the meantime.
