As is happens this demo is first proper Compet-N max for the Twilight. Henning got unteleported revenant in his pl15-243. This demo is my first exit without monsters left alive under Henning's demo time. I have 2:29 with two lost monsters and 2:33 with a chainie forgotted near the yellow key.  Route credit goes to Henning Skogsto and Daniel "Demonlord" Lindgren. 
pl15-odd is an interesting noclip situation.
