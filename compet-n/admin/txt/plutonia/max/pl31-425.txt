  Description :-)

  Here goes; me and Henning had a competition on this level, for two months or
  so... His first time was 5:33, then i got a 5:24, he got 5:09, me 5:02, he
  4:45, and finally me with this one... I sent this to the team (well, Adam ;)
  a bit too late, 'cause my internet connection didn't work for a while,
  so Henning didn't really get that much time beating this. But if you check
  out the Compet-N Plutonia times once in a while, there might be a faster
  demo by Henning... :)
  Really nice map BTW, especially for fast-recording :)
