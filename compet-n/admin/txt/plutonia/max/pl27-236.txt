  Description :-)

  Ohh look at this one, very nice. Imagine spending 3 days with instant playing 
  just to end up improving a whole demo with only 1 sec. You can sometimes wonder 
  what the point is :-) A rather perfect map, lots of cells and a BFG. You can
  leave very many monsters behind and crush them later when you're about to exit,
  but this doesn't make it more easy, believe me...
