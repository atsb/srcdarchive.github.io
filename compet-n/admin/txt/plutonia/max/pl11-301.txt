  Description :-)

  Another map I've played before (besides 10, 24 and 31). It was easier to
  remember the maze than for the others to learn it. Tried different routes,
  started with 30 seconds off my best time (-fast monsters ;), and wondered
  even that I couldn't reach the my previous COMPET-N record. But the critical
  point here is that you've got to kill _all_ Archviles from _closest_ range,
  best at a corner, where you can show yourself, have them start firing at you,
  and blast them out of your sight ;) Unfortunately I haven't hit any archvile
  at the exit, and had still 100% at the exit, which takes much longer to 
  die. But the second-to-last Archvile was too much irritated when I fired 
  at him to make me jump.
