  Description :-)

  A beautiful map with tons of health and tons of rockets, very fun to play,
  I am sure it can be done under 3 minutes and not too hard but in nearly
  every run I made something went wrong, monsters didn't cooperate etc...
  it's amazing what a difference there is between playing this normally and
  speedy.
