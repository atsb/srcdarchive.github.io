  Description :-)

  A pretty tricky map, lots of close combats and teleporting monsters. The end in
  particular can be hell, I had lots of good rounds which ended cause that archie
  fried me (80% health lost every time). My demo here is not very good, the 
  mid-section is ok visually I guess. I had some luck with the chaingunners
  in the green tower- they teleported quickly. The end didn't go well at all
  though, I had to hide from the archie. It also bothers me that I missed some
  shots in the dark metal room where those damn spectres stalk.
