  Description :-)

  Extremely good looking map, very well planned and filled with action. Good from
  beginning to end, surely one of my (many :) Plutonia favourites. I didn't work
  on this demo for many hours, its not a hard map to record. I had some luck
  with the two archies, although the 2'nd one managed to spawn a caco.
  I had one go where I strafed over the exit and down the cliff, think
  that one was better looking :-\
