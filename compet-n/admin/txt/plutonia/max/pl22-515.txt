  Description :-)

  Great map!! Lovely gameplay and awesome design, very realistic in a strange
  way. I enjoyed playing this map a lot. The big garden with the rising bridge
  can be annoying though, mainly cause of the painees and spectres. Some 
  missing in this demo, but below 5 mins will be hard (my second best time
  was 5:32). A lot of nice ideas in this map, like the slime-falls and those
  beautiful mountain shaped outdoor areas. Peo's old demo is pretty stylish, what
  shaved off some time in my demo was the direct run for the redkey (instead of
  killing the monsters and then teleport back).
