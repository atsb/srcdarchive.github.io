Description :

Yay! My first Plutonia Max-Kill demo! =)

While going back and re-downloading all of the current Plutonia Max-Kill
records, I noticed that for a Hegyi map 30, this one just seemed...slow.
It was still a nice demo, however, and you should go watch it =) I thought
I'd give it a try.

15 minutes, and had a 1 second improvement which sucked...so I decided to
make a better looking one than that one was. After changing the route,
and leaving the Cyberdemon for the end (seems to have a higher success
rate of killing him this way...), and 3 hours or so of playing, I get
this, and I'm proud of it ^_^

Route credits go to Adam Hegyi, who had a great demo before me.

Oh yeah! I thought I'd include this 1:16 exit that I had...I swear, this
WAD was doing ANYTHING it could to make sure I didn't exit that time!

Enjoy!
