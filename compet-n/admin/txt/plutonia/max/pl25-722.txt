  Description :-) Whoa! This is a real bitch map! "Buggy" as well.
  Not a favourite of mine, about 50% of the recordings have a sergeant
  "buried" in the texture. took about 2 hours of playing to get this.
  It is very hard even in normal uv, all credits to DL who did it with
  -fast in 07:30!! It gets easier after you have killed all hellknights..
  Agree with DL, that there is no "safe" way to get past them..
  There are 2 hidden sergeants behind 2 shutters, if you wonder why I 
  shoot plasma at the wall? Just checking that they are dead..
