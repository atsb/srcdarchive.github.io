C-N entry #113.

Thanks to Adam Hegyi for a nice route here.
This level was fun for a while, but became
irritating once it got down to squeezing
seconds away from the time.  As he says, the
skulls are always there to help you destroy
yourself once the time comes to clean up the
hordes near the yellow door.  The AVS don't
teleport sometimes, either.
