Description: The trick with the red key and more important the SSG helps here.
	     I even managed to jump through the other window and had plasmagun
	     then. This is an every-monster-dead entry, the time for a 100/100
	     could be improved by maybe 1/2 minutes. At least, you don't have
	     to check for chaingunners left. I had very many rockets (27) at
	     the exit room, maybe I should have used them on the crowd at the
	     yellow door. But there isn't that much space, you can hurt yourself
	     easily there. If you don't like to jump to the red key, you can
	     also wait for a Dude to open it, since the other side is a normal
	     door. Think you should kill the monsters outside first then :)
