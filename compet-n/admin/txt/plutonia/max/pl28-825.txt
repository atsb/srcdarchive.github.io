 Description : A very long level from Plutonia. An easy level really, the only 
               catch here is, are you lucky enough to get 100% kills. I
               guess thats what puts people off it, cos you cant really send
               in a demo with less, cos it would take less time also, to kill
               the demons that you missed....
               All the monsters *usually* teleport in anyway.
               Survival is easy here, so time is important. I dont think I
               made too many errors, I suppose about 7:50 - 8:00 would be the 
               optimum time...
               Anthe made some good points in fdgmcol.txt about this level,
               especially about the tunnel. It looks sensational!!! :-)
