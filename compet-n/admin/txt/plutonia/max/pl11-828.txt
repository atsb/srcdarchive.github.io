Description: Nice level. The only problem is that you have to search
             for your archviles. I like it anyway, except that there
             is no easy way (or no way at all) [ ? ] to kill all the
             archviles. I managed to leave only two of them alive :)
             Perhaps 1 is possible.
             Only an initial entry.

[  Admin. Note :-)  An excellent "initial entry" - Very well done :)

   To beat this entry you need More Kills or a Faster Time.

   "Hope there will be improvements." ;-)
