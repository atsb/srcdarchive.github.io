  Description :-)

  A nice map, but could have been better... Some potential ammo problems. In
  the end I killed them all from close range instead of hiding and playing
  it safe, this way it's a lot more fun ;-)

  I think the time is ok, there aren't too many mistakes, perhaps around
  2:45 is possible...
