  Description :)
  It's nice to see a 3 some where on that tally screen, disregarding the par
  of 3:30 of course. This run is quit a lot faster than my PL11-240 I did a
  few hours earlier. Much less SR50 was used when I knew I was approaching
  an area where I generally got stuck at. Still a few parts where I run into
  a wall and take a half a second to get back on the road. It's a shame I
  still haven't beaten my failed PL11-237 (the secret somehow didn't register)
  though I'm very surprised this run ended up being a record as I was talking
  to my dad toward the end of my demo, and when ever I talk and play at the
  same time, my demo usually ends up being shit. Pretty cool that he got to
  see me beat a record in real time though, especially at such an unexpected
  moment.
  
  *sigh* I wish I didn't instantly over-write my failed PL11-237, it was a
  pretty cool run especially since the world record at the time was 2:41
  (by me of course), that's a four second improvement.
  								
  								
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 2:40 by me, timestamped:
