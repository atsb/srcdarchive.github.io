  Description :-)

  When Peo refered to this map as "terrible" in his Compet-N entry, I don't
  think he meant to say the map is ugly. The gameplay can best be described as
  terrible though. Its surely an awesome built map with a wonderful wood-theme,
  but the placement of rapid firing enemies is a disaster. The cybie is just
  wasting time and cells, and the end is a real pain in the ass.
  As a former recorder of this map said: "This was not a very speedy
  performance by me..:)"
