Description:

	Dunno if I ever killed Cyberdemon with SSG before. I had practise
	a long time ago in cybrdeth.wad, with rockets/plasmagun and more
	difficult with Shotgun. And not one Cyberdemon at a time, but 6.
	Sorry Yonatan that I've taken over one of your records, you are free
	to strike back. As I watched your LMP I had noticed a cell pack
	behind the Revenants, you see that it's very helpful. The rest of
	the time improvement I gain at the Barons, but rockets are dangerous
	there, it's my favourite suicide place there :). I think the map is
	not that difficult, but a very good training map indeed, wide open
	area to catch every rocket :) I dunno how much time it saves when
	you are able to make some 3000 Hitpoints BFG shots at the Cybies,
	I think it is too dangerous. I like to waste BFG for crowds of mon-
	ters, such as Pigs and Revenants, even if Revenants survive the
	traces of one BFG shot. So I fire 2 or 3 :)
	If you really want a challenge, I think Hell Revealed map 32 is what
	you should play. I still can't believe that Yonatan survived it.
	One time 3% health right in the middle of a crowd of monsters and
	2 Cyberdemons, and the other scene I wondered about was that he wasn't
	telefragged by the Icon Thrower (oh yes, a 10 minutes map with an Icon 
	Thrower! You will never run out of monsters ... :)

Yonatan: "Hmm, the text file seems very long, I am probably learning from Kai"

	I like the long text more :)
