C-N entry #116.

Thanks to Andy for his nice run of this
map, and also thanks to Vincent for making
the yellow key useless with his special
shortcut.  I had to practice the trick a
few times to ensure that I wouldn't mess
it up at the end of a nice run, and my
nerves were on end once the time came. All
in all an excellent map, great replayability.
