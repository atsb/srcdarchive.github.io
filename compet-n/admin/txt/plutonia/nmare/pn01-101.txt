  Description :-)

  Welcome to newbie terror Thierry! :))))
  
  Don't worry, it's quite a common thing at COMPET-N
  to beat someone's introduction demo as fast as
  possible, so that no one gets a "hey, this is easy!"
  impression here... Adam Williamson is the main terrorist,
  but he is away right now so I took up his job.
  
  57 seconds cut off Thierry's time, I think someone
  could go well under 1 minute, as this is a relative
  easy nightmare map of Plutonia.
