Description: this demo is 2 months old, i tried to improve it... w/o success :-(.
	    
	     2 tricky parts here, the yellow key area...very luck dependent. And the 
             red key area (with tons of barons and an archie).

             I found a strange bug while playing...and that helps to complete this map
             on NM. It involves a linedef skipping (like ev12) : it's a line on the
             teleporter that you must skip, this line raises the sector with the 
             barons and archie. When they're up it's a pain, reaching the red key w/o
             BFG is impossible i think. When they are down, take care they can still 
             shoot and claw you.

             So this is a new trick :) only usefull in NM and it do not work very often.

             note : another 1st ever :)
