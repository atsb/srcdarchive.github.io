Description:
 First map I'm trying NM with Plutonia ... very fun to play and not too difficult if you have a little luck, especially with the spawning monsters. mmm... here I was quite lucky ( look at how the mancubii miss me ... I didn't understand anything while playing :). Oh, and the little trick in the yellow key room is very useful :)
