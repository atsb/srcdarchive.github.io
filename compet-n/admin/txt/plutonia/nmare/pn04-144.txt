Description: Sorry Henning, you may think i've betrayed you :=)
             But as we spoke about it, i tried it and i got
             the envy to do it :) As i played i felt it wasn't that hard.
             I found some tricks to make life easier. But your success will
             depend mostly on the barons...

	     Henning > i know u'll be a lot faster, i played rather safely here..
                       just wanted to exit. 1:15 would be great :)

	     note  : yeah, another 1st ever in the pocket :)
