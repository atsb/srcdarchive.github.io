Well afaik is this the 1st plutonia nm recording from scratch :-)
Sorry for this, but I was rather proud after making it, since I 
even did it with 100% secrets. Although this map has only 1 secret,
this makes it much harder since you need the rocket launcher to kill 
the pain el and the caco, so the time is rather uninteresting, because
I need to play the whole map, what surely increases the fun when watching
and yes that's what you now should do ;-) (just a suggestion ... )
