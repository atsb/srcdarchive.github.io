  Description :)
  
  BTW, I stopped after arch-vile blast for a reason, there's
  a linedef which you need to cross while the door is closed
  to open it, if I continued running after arch-vile blast
  the door would still be closing because it was opened when
  you go get red key and that way the linedef wouldn't
  activate and I would find the door closed.
  Archies can be annoying as seen here, well this just proves
  that I am able to get 49 and I might go for it someday :)
