Description:

I got my target which was below 1 min, but I was not 
satisfactorily filled. Therefore, I tried this map again 
to improve 1 sec or 2 sec, and I obtained this run.
The last part was really, really lucky. I don't yet know why 
I survived it.

I wouldn't return to pn32 because I came to feel tired of
waiting lucky chances. Considerable luck would be necessary 
to get a faster run.
