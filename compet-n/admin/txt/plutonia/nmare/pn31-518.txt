Description:
Entry #26, this improved time came on the third try, to my amazement.

I wrote previously: This is not the greatest performance by me, but it was by
                    far the hardest.  Playing this map on nightmare took its
                    toll on my nerves.

                    It takes more strategy than one would expect to play this
                    one on nightmare, mostly to guide the cyberdemons to the
                    right places so you can safely go about your business.
                    Overall performance can be considered messy, and there was
                    one point after I grab the yellow key where I should have
                    ate a rocket.  You'll know it when you see it. :)

The primary reason I redid this level is because Vince brought to my attention
a secret that I overlooked.  It's not a major secret, but the teleport in the 4th
cyber room counts as one.  I pick that up in this demo, so this one also counts as
a nm100s demo.  Not only that, but it looks better, too. :)

A big thanks goes out to Vince for pointing that out. :)
