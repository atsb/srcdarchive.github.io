===================================
Description :-)

To fx: No slowdown or other tools were used in making of this run. Some 
alcohol was though.

To quote sedlos pn10-21.txt, "safe play on nm is kinda old already". This
is about as unsafe is gets, I must have had close to 200 runs that got to
the exit room, which in itself wasn't trivial, and this is the first (and 
probably only) succesful one. Includes some weird stuff like me going nuts 
before going for the glide since I only killed two spectres and was
wondering where the other two were. Thankfully somewhere else, possibly
stuck at the elevator or something. Unlike the first two (or three if you
count that pn08 one) runs I posted I feel like this is actually "worthy" 
for compet-n.

So yeah, enjoj.

(I included a savegame at the exit room so you, too, can feel the pain. 
Or alternatively practice if you want to get the record... but please go
for the nm 100% secrets one first)
