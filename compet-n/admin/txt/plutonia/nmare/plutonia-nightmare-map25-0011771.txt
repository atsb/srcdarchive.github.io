Description: 
pn25-216 by Adam Hegyi is quite an old record, since then there has been discovered a glide
which allows you to skip quite a bit of the level. I was surprised nobody has improved this
one before with the new route. I tried the UV-speed route before looking at pn-216, I figured
I wouldn't waste my time on it, but the starting route of pn-216 is quite safe.
