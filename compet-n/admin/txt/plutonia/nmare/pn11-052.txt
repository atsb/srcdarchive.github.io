Description: I wanted to test my skills today...just to see if I'm rusty
             after whole month of not playing this game. I started this
             becouse fx mention to me today that record is 58? here..
             I just had to improve that...and quite eazy (20 min. job)
             I get this one. But now this was faster that my uvspeed record
             which leads to another story...
