Description :

Well Vile, I actually didn't think I'd beat your time, ever. I guess I
just got an amazing lucky break on this demo. I dunno where the Pain
Elemental went this time either, but I don't care, he's out of the way.

I've been working on this one since Vile did pn12-020 (I recommend
watching his as well), and it was a VERY difficult demo for me to take.
This is my first exit in about...oh....1000+ attempts ^^' It didn't
become my main project until about a week ago...

Had one attempt where I got the jump and just missed the exit by a small
distance, the time on it was 19 seconds.

I'm really proud of this demo, my personal fastest one I've ever done.
Although it's funny when I blast myself, I quickly switch to the automap
to see how badly angled I was for the jump, but as you can see, I made
the jump ^_^

The route credits and Archie-Rocket-Jump credits go to stx-Vile.

Sedlo, I think it's your turn to optimize this one like you did the
UV-Speed ;)
