Description :

Woooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!

FINALLY improved it!! Hegyi's demo is AMAZING!! I had trouble shaving just this
1 second off of his!

I spent quite a long time on this one, working off and on to complete it. I
finally have an exit though, and I'm rather happy =)

Back when I was a keyboarder, I tried this then...my best was EXACTLY 1:18.00,
and 1 more gametic faster would've broken the record then.

Come to think of it....it's been MANY months if I was working on this when I
was a keyboarder...that was around 6 months ago or so. I'm extremely happy that
I accomplished beating the time on this one ^_^

Exact time was 1:17.80 so I almost didn't get it =P

Thanks to Adam Hegyi for a spectacular 1:18 on this map! I'm sure if he still
recorded demos, he'd rip this demo to pieces easily. Enjoy ^_^
