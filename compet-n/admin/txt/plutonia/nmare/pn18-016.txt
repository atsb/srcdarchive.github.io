Description:
 hehe ... I don't understand how I finish the level :) HUGE mistakes here: first I miss the SSG ... "what the heck?" and I went on; I manage to get through the imps and sergents with pistol ( not really easy in NM); a little later I stupidly fell from the ledge, and was about to press Q ... but M.Archie must have felt pity for me, and me made me jump to the exit, what surprised me a lot :)
52s off Istvan's time :)
