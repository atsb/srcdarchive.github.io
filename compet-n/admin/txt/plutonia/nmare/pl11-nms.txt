Description: Same as in the UV speed run. Maybe even easier, because the
	     Archviles stay where they see you first and attack you. Some-
	     times in the UV attempts it happend that I heard no Archvile
	     awakening sound when I pressed the button and run out, if you
	     managed to be that lucky you've got a map without monsters, all
	     you have to do is to turn left after the start.
