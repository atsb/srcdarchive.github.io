   Except the last room, is not so hard, but that one is a different story...
 I tried many routes there
   -only running and and hopeing the cybie will not catch you... once I pressed
    both buttons and tried to escape but I jumped in a rocket which was aimed 
    to a revenant....
   -playing the role of bait while a cybie moves to a harmless place and 
    pushing one button, then moving the cybie to other place and pushing
    the other... but I always get killed by revenants...
   -killing the cybie like Kai did in his 'gm' .lmp, interesting,
    not the revenants are dangerous this way but the chaingunners...
   -and finally this way... no chaingunners on your back, and even the 
    revenants will help you... it become close, too many revenants came up, in 
    wrong time, and I missed the hideing place... 

 Anyway, enjoy it...
 
 Many thanks to Peo, he helped me a LOT with his tips!
