  Description :)
  
  I tried a route innovation which involves skipping those
  3 revenants saving some time. I didn't need to many tries
  after that so I don't know how much luck is needed to finish
  the map this way. It also means you don't have to grab the
  rocket launcher, and in this demo by the time I get the
  rocket launcher I don't have any use for it.
