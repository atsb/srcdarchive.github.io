  Description :)

  After a while I was able to get 49, but I decided it was
  crap and that I should try to improve it.  I tried it
  a lot and then finally I get this.  You'll probably think
  this is not a lot better and you're probably right, but at
  least I felt better about my performance in this demo.  I had
  quite a lot of frustrating experiences with this one:
  one demo where I fell off after reaching the final teleporter,
  2 times where the cyberdemon shot me right before the end, and
  one demo where I was running up to the wall to do the rocketjump,
  and then a shotgunner respawned in my face.
