Final Doom - Plutonia Experiment - Level 05 (Ghost Town)

  Skill:   NightMare!  Can handle it!
  Kills:   74%
  Items:   78%           ********
  Secrets: 100% and Time * 2:10 *
  Min Hlth: 11%          ********

Comments: This level is harder in NightMare than it looks in this
          recording.  At the end, usually a Baron respawns before
          you kill the Arch Vile and makes life difficult.
          I make the start harder by not taking the MegaSphere
          early, because usually you need every drop of health to
          survive the end.  Still, because it can be done so
          quickly this is probably one of the easier NM Plutonias.
