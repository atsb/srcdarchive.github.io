Description :

I shaved off two seconds from Selim's run using the rocket-boost through the
space near the Megasphere. I originally had a 1 second improvement, but this
one came along shortly after.

This could probably go to around 30 seconds using the rocket-boost, but it's
luck that determines if you can survive the blast mostly. You have all those
enemies firing at you and if you can't get them to somehow infight they'll
cause you to kill yourself with the boost ^^'

This thing is action packed throughout it...at least I think so...

My school's prom was today...and this run was pulled off when I got home from
it ^_^
