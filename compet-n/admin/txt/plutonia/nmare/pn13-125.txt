C-N entry #83.

A big thanks to Vincent for being the first
to run this, I use his strategy here.  The
switch room with the archvile/chaingunners
turns out to be the most difficult part, as
it is trial and error to run past the gunners
and hope you don't die.. and sometimes my ssg
shots don't kill the spectres, which is just
irritating.

One note, this run is also ps13, but the funny
thing is Vincent actually runs over the only
secret sector (the soulsphere) and didn't get
credited for it in the tally.  A shame it didn't
trigger, but it's done now, so there. :)
