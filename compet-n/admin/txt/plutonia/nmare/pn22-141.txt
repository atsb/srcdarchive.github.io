Demo entry #14.

Description:

Anders Johnsen greatly extolled this map in the old Plutonia demopack. Yes, i
think it's a very beautiful combination of technology and hell, with the
atmosphere remindering me of some levels from Zen Intergalactic Ninja (one of
the very best NES games, Konami, 1993). Even though there are some even better
maps in Plutonia and Evilution.

The blue key trap is a bomb with very random blast damage :) I got seriously
hurt there, but saved some stimpacks to correct my health after it.

I leave the NM Secrets demo to Vile, as it's stylish.
