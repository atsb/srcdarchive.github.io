  Description :-) 
    The great escape!
    HUH, this one needed a lot of LUCK... I kept on trying because I got the
 red key at my 2-3rd try, and I thought only some seconds left so maybe...
 I was right, watch the result... rather enjoyable... full of action. There
 are only a few seconds where I didn't pressed the fire button ;-)))
