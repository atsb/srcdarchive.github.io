C-N entry #79.

This one is frustrating sometimes..
especially getting knocked off the edge
when you hit the switch at the very end.
I used Anthe's method here, saving the
invincibility for the end.

I integrated pn09 and the undone ps09 into
the same run; the secret Anthe skipped was
close to the main path.
