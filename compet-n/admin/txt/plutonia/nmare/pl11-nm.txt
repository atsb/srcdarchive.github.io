   Frightening map... but I took revenge for that poor guy at the begining.
 The rule 'you must have a clear plan' must be true here twice! And you must
 learn the maze, at least that part where your route goes.
   It may become boring to watch some of the scenes, it is not like the other 
 nm entries, I played quite safe, but who can fight those archvilles face to
 face , noway!
   I was untouchable during the recording, so this is why the 'minimum health' 
 is 115!
