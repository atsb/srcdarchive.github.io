Description :-)

This run is kinda BS - you have to survive getting up the elevators 
(which I got maybe once in 20 tries), set up the glide and hope a 
chaingunner won't mess you up, get the glide fast and then not get blown 
up by the archvile. Cack_handed got 19 on UV and I can't see why that 
wouldn't be possible on NM but I sure can't make it happen. A couple of 
times I managed to run past the first two sergeants without waking them 
up which was interesting.
