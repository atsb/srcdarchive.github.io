  I really don't know what happend here... the revenants didn't came out...
  Once it happend during the practice, and now again, this way is a LOT easier,
 even with a weak start I could survive it.
  If you know the answer, please tell me I'm really curious...
  
  In your way back, better knock on the door, and the imps will open it... this
time I thought that they were stucked too, like the revenants, so I tried to 
jump in again, but they opened the door 'just in time'.

  Credits to Kai for the shortcut.
