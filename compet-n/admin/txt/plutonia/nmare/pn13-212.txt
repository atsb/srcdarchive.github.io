Description: Another unbested map on skill 5 falls :)
             It's not that easy i must admit, the hardest is to get out of archie place
             alive... the baron sitting at the bottom of the stairs sometimes do not
             want to get out .. (this time it was ok :).
             You'll say that the archie room is easier with the blue armor, that right
             but try to get it b4 (lots of mancos:) and when you come back with the blue 
             key the mancos block your way. So skipped it by using a key grab (similar to
	     doom2 map06 yellow key grab).
             In fact that's the 2nd time i can return to the yellow key room. The 1st time
             i died cause of the mancos :).
             The rest is pretty easy.
   
             Tip : i think it's possible to exit archie's room w/o killing him...  
                   that would be a lot faster.
