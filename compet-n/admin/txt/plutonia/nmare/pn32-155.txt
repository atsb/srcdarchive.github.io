             Well...guess a few more oceans passed since then, cus this was 
	     rediculously easy...spent about as much time on it as the 
	     uv speed. Can't belive I found this to be hard really :D 
	     A few bfgs here and there, some rockets to dodge and you are 
	     home safe. Its less of a pain than underhalls on skill 5...
	     Of course this demo is timewise a big joke, just wanted to
	     try it out for nostalgic reasons :)
