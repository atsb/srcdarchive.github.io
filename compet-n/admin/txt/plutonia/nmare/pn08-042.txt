  Description :)
  
  After rp24 I was trying some other glides and got to this 
  one. After a while I was able to get it to work so I made
  this demo. There's not too much to worry about except for
  some chainers and the arch-viles of course so it can be
  done in a movie. Btw, Stx-Vile still maintains the nightmare
  secrets record which is much more impressive than this crap.
