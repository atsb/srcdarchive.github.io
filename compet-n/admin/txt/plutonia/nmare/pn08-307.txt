C-N entry #78.

It goes without saying that a big thanks is
in order to Henning for his previous demo
over this map.  If you don't know the story,
his demo was disqualified because he admitted
to using IDDT in the blue key room.  That demo
laid out the groundwork for this run and
wouldn't be possible without it.

I plan on improving this run, because it is a
bit sloppy in parts, but I think I'll wait until
my frustration with the run has died down a bit. :)
