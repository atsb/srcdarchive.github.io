   The beginning is PERFECT... no damage till the blue door.
   I wasn't played this with my keyboard, and this one doesn't offers me 'free'
 control, so the 'silly' movements is the result of this.
   At the end it seemed that my fire button want to took me down... that first 
 bfg shoot was a century for me... but I had some luck... huh.
   I didn't picked up an 25% health bonus at the end, so the minimum health
 should be 63% (not bad!).
