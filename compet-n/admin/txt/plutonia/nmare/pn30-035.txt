  # Description:  #  HIIIII :)  2 days ago I had 40 seconds on this level and I decided #
  #################  to post it, and on the txt I wrote "I'd like to reach the optimal  #
  # time in this level, which should be around 35 seconds, and I'll try :) " and here   #
  # it is... yeahhh XD									#
  # Maybe it's not optimal, 'cause I think it should be 32/33 s, (I killed the cyber    #
  # slowly ) but I'm really proud of this because the old record on this level was      #
  # made by Xit-Vono and he had 43, so I'm really happy.				# 
  # Will I try this again?  eheh, you already know the answer :)   yeppppp		#
  # Until then... see ya folks :)                                                       #
