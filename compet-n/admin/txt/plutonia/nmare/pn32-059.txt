Description:

I challenged this map again after a long separation.
When I got 1:05 demo which is my first Comepet-N Entry,
my control skill was not good. However, I believed that 
below 1 min is possible from that time.
Yes, I eventually got below 1 min. Although I only waited 
several hours until luck came to me, the record is pretty good.
