Description: Very few Archviles running around, and I tried to make no noise
	     :). Minimum health is 100% (at the start), I always wondered how
	     a Max-min-health entry could have more than 100. Anyway, since I
	     wasn't hit during the whole LMP (Nightmare is just so easy :) and
	     there is no item left, I think this LMP cannot be beaten. I've got
	     115% health at the end. Hm, I could have shown the secret sector.
	     It's opposite to the first door I pass. The button there makes a
	     trace to the yellow key and to the yellow switch. Just if you
	     don't know where to run in that maze. I prefer the red key, it's
	     closer to the button for the door and not guarded by a separate
	     Archvile.
