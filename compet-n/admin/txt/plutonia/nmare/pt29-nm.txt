  Description :-) Not too hard, but it has some tricky parts..
  I played it fairly safe and saved plasma by killing the
  first arachnotron with the sg, I also killed the baron to get
  the soulsphere just in case there would be problems on the
  way to the exit.. You have to make the jump for the megasphere 
  and take the yellowkey at the same time, without that, press quit!
