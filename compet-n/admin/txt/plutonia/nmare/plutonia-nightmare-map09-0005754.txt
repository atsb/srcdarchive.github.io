Description: 
My first nightmare demo.

pn09-104 didn't grab the invurnability, I think you can save time by picking it up and
using rockets instead of plasma on the 4 spectres + cacodemon. Even if you don't the 
time loss would be very small and obviously it's much safer. I also used a triggerskip,
because getting knocked off by mancubi directly after hitting switch was quite common when testing.

So this was quite a safe route, glide could be faster too.

Also, very annoying to do guideless glide with invurnability.
