  Description :)
  
  This was the first time that I tried to telefrag the
  mancubus.  Usually I just go along the edge but this
  way should be faster, and that's why I got this time
  instead of the usual 2:05 or so.  Like stx-vile, I took
  all the secrets, although the one behind the key is not
  far off the route, it does make the map slightly harder.
  I was quite nervous for the ending, there were a lot of
  fireballs making me bounce around but I somehow managed
  to say on top.
