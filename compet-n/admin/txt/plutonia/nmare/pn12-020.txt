C-N entry #103.

Well folks, it's all over: the plutonia
nightmare speed table = OWNED! ;)

Seriously, myself and Casey had been
thinking about this trick for a while,
but I just fired up the map tonight and
found a nice spot to try it.  It's an
amusing trick, so enjoy the demo.  Most
of the fighting here is used to draw the
PE away from the teleport, since his skulls
pretty much ruin any attempts at the jump.
