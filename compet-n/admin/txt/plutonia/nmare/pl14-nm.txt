  Description :-) 
     Hey, this was hard... I don't know what happend to the first archie, he 
 didn't teleported in, unfortunately the second did. It was the second time 
 I killed him, without killing I died so many times at the  yellow door,
 almost gave up... I had TONS OF LUCK this time, really!
    The rest is not too hard if you kill the revanant at the balcon.
