 Kind of funny route I've found here...  
 First I tried to make it with picking up every key, but once the archville 
 killed me like this time... so I thought it would be nice to end this level
 without any keys... watch pl18-022 too.
 I think it is possible with normal route too, once I picked up the blue key, 
 but a chaingunner re-spawned in my back, and killed me. It's hard to play 
 with keyboard, those bastards always re-spawning in your back, those fast 
 turns would help a lot!
