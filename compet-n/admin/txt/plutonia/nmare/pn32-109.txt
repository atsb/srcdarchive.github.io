  Description :)
  
  When I saw my record on youtube I decided to give this a
  try because it was a very old recorded and recorded on
  a pentium 90 with significant slowdown. This map is
  somewhat luck based since there are things that the
  player has no control over, such as whether the first
  or second cyberdemon respawns. All 3 cyberdemons were
  killed quickly so this is a pretty good time.
