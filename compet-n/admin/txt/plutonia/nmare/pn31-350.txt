C-N entry #177.

The infamous Cyberden is getting some
great attention this update so I made
my own lame contribution.  I think the
current pacifist route is more tricky,
this just isn't as nerve-wrecking as it
used to be.  The only tricky part is
the end, since cybers like to stand
guard at the door to the chainer room.
I almost get smacked by a rocket leaping
from the yellow key pillar and I provide
my own spin on the end RJ.  It hardly
works but it's fun to pull off. :)
