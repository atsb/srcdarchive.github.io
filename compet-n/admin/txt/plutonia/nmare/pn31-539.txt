Description:
Entry #25, and I had no idea what I was getting myself into with this one.

This is not the greatest performance by me, but it was by far the hardest.
Playing this map on nightmare took its toll on my nerves.

It takes more strategy than one would expect to play this one on nightmare,
mostly to guide the cyberdemons to the right places so you can safely go about
your business.  Overall performance can be considered messy, and there was
one point after I grab the yellow key where I should have ate a rocket.  You'll
know it when you see it. :)
