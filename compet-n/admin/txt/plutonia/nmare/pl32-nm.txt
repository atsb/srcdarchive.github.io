Description: I've wanted to nail this one on skill 5 before. Couldn't do
             it 8 months ago, but that's an ocean of Dooming since :)
             I know it dosn't look that good- or hard. But belive me, its
             *hard*.             

             Note: Cause Final Doom's exe cant handle the joyb_speed31, I
             used the originall Doom2.exe (1.9). So, to get a correct
             playback of this lmp, you'll have to run plutonia.wad 
             together with Doom2's exe...got it? :)
