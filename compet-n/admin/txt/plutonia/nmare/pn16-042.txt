Description:
 Well, I haven't seen any demo for this level so I had to find a route by myself.
mmm.... w/o a few tricks, the level would really be unfair. And the last room can really be a hell. I'm quite satisfied with my solution here, no time wasted and no monsters horde on our back. Oh, and taking the yellow key carefully helps a lot :)
13s better than Robert :)
