  Description :-)

  This is probably my first and last contribution to Final Doom Nightmare...
  I hate Nightmare and can't really see the point of playing this skill a
  lot... but still, I did this one. It is not too hard, you need to kill
  cybie while being careful from all the shots around you and then hit the
  rockets with good aim or else with all the spawns PLUS the REspawns it
  will get very busy there...
