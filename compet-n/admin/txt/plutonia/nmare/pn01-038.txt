  Description :)

  I'm very happy that I managed this jump in a nightmare
  demo :)  At first I thought the jump was ridiculously hard
  but now that I've practiced it I can get it around 1/5 times.
  It may seem lame to do this only 3 seconds faster than the
  long route, but I still think this is a good time for me.
  Previous exits were 43 and 51.
