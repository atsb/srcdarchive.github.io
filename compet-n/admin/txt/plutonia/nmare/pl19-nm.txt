 Oops, think I must hurry with upload, so just a short txt....
 Istvan asked me this day (or was it yesterday =) whether 
 I could make this map and first I didn't want to because 
 of all those monsters around (I prefer quite play) but
 well it's a plutonia map and we all know those ones, the end
 is luck pure and while playing I didn't think I would make it
 because of all those mistakes I made. The position I use at the 
 end was found some lmps earlier and really make things easier
 and all other tricks like getting cybie start fighting with
 others senseless....

 Enjoy ...
