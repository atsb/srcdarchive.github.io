                I did this demo, then went and checked. The teleporting
                monsters are all in an area that opens up after you
                get the red key - so don't make a noise and they won't
                appear.

                One second faster than the UV record, but then this is
                much easier on nightmare. I had a big dose of luck in
                that the rising wall at the blue key didn't rise - gained
                maybe three seconds there. Alas, the running quality
                in this demo is not great, and the stupid exit platform
                knocked me off! 1:36 was clearly not to be.
