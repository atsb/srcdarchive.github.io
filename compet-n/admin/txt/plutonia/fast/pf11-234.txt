  C-N entry #11.	Date:12/10/2011


  Description :)
  Though I recorded this LMP file on second day of June, in 2011, I did not
  immediately post it because since I've done this map so much, I felt like I
  was hogging the Plutonia map 11 board and that I better brake a few
  records on some other maps before I submit another PF11-xxx.LMP file.
  But, in honer of DOOM's 18th birthday, I decided to submit a C-N entry.
  This sadly was the only map I had an entry for, but you got what you got
  and this is what I got, my 4th PF11-xxx.LMP entry.

  Now, about the actual game-play; I was quite amazed to get this time. It is
  ten seconds faster than my first  PF11-xxx.LMP entry which was back in
  03/03/2011 which I find hard to believe was less than a year ago. Now, on
  this I clearly got lucky, there's no skill at all in this. The Arch-viles
  flinched at the right moments and the walls where just at the right spots
  for me not to crash in to them to much with my insane mouse driven SR50
  (NOT "mouse driver", I just use the mouse click to turn on strafe) which
  almost got me in trouble on my first C-N entry as you can see here:
  http://www.doomworld.com/vb/showthread.php?s=&postid=831080#post831080

  I won't be surprised if this will be my last C-N entry, I don't have 
  much time to play DOOM and when I do, it is to precious to spend on anything 
  other than family and friends. 

  Ahh, I feel so old yet I'm so young...

  [Btw, 77% kills is maximum on this map (in UV) with out going to the exit on
  the right and with out the "-respawn" parameter.]

  
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 2:41 by me.
