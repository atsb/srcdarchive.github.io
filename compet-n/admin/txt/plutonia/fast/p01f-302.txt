Description: Quite easy level, Revenents can however sometimes
	     cause a lot of trouble, but I found out that they
	     are way easier than in original UV mode, this is 
	     because they shoot at the same moment they see you 
	     (pillars blocks their shots) and therefore doesn't 
	     get too close too quickly..
	     Pretty satisfied with the time it's only about 30 
	     secs from my UV record at 2.36.. Quite few monsters 
	     and pretty linear makes it easier though....
