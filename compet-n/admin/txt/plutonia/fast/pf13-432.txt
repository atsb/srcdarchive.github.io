==============================================

Aesthetically speaking, one of my best demos.
The time is not so good, however, I expected at least 4:25
at the exit... not to mention Tatsurd or Kimo could undoubtly
get ~3:50, they are much better arch-vile killers.

Yellow key door   :37      Happy with the beginning, 5 sec.faster
                           than my second best.
Ladder           1:57      4 seconds lost. The cacos were in good
                           positions to kill them quickly.
                           No luck with HK/chainee or arach/manc
                           infighting. Playing safe with the rev
                           (credits go to z0diac).
Soulsphere       2:38      6 seconds gained. Still, the arch-vile
                           can be killed faster.
Baron - 5 SSG shots        I like it :)
Rocket launcher  3:16      1 second gained.
Switch           4:02      No time gained. But hey! I have lots
                           of health at this point, unusual!
Exit             4:32      4 seconds gained, 12 overall compared
                           to 4:44, my second best. Of course,
                           the last pain elemental could have been
                           killed faster.
