  C-N entry #10.	Date:05/29/2011

  Description :)
  I made this demo on Saturday, May 21, 2011, but was to depressed to submit
  it. Life's been sad now that ive lost My Olivia girl. But anyways, back to
  My DOOM life. So, I know ive been playing this level like crazy and so
  here's another entry... but since ive been playing this level like a drug
  addict, to cure my addiction im now playing all of Ultimate DOOM's levels
  maxing each one out and then after that, ill do DOOM II's... maybey ill
  brake some records... I don't know, proballly not as I'm not realy a DOOM
  expert, just a Hunted expert.
  PS: wow, it's a good thing the first time I was writting this it faled to
  save and I had to start all over... I was angry as hell and was cussing
  and everything when I first did this. But anyways, this demo is pretty
  ugly so if you don't like bleeding eyes, watch PF11-242... and yes I know
  this is full of missspellings but I'm tired and lazy and I'm not gonna
  put any extra enerjy into anything right now so ya. Have a good day :)

  PF11-242 Description:
  Just like my last demo but with less SR50, I guess it's about time I learn
  that slow and steady wins the race...

  PF11-244 Description:
  Wow it's been a long time since I broke a C-N record, and it's been a long
  time since Ive played Doom. Since my last entry in April 2010 I haven't been
  playing much of anything, but today I decided to play some and, after two
  hours I did what I had given up on a long time ago. I don't think I'll be
  making any more demos, but I don't know. I still love Doom but braking
  records isn't really important to me anymore, now that I know so much more
  about this crazy world. But I wont get into that, just enjoy the demo :)

  [Btw, 77% kills is maximum on this map (in UV) with out going to the exit on
  the right and with out the "-respawn" parameter.]

  
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 2:42 by me.
