  Description :)
  Ehh, one second improvement. PR18-148 was a much better demo.
  Anyways, under 2:00 is quite doable; I will improve this later.

  PS: Can't beleive Revved's UV -RESPAWN run was slower than his
  UV -FAST run.
  								
  								
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 2:12 by Revved
