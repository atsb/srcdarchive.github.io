Description:  Quite easy level, also very small and fast with
	      not that much monsters. In fact I think this is one 
	      of the smallest levels in Plutonia.wad (maybe the 
	      smallest??). However, I think it was nice playing it 
	      eventhough sometimes annoying things happened, like 
	      when some monsters shots starts going through solid 
	      walls without explanation.. This happened quite often 
              at the start with the Barons of hell and with the
              Mancubus. 
	      Further the level has no armour at all, no Soulsphere, 
              Mega or Blure sphere so you have to 
              run "slow"....... Or you'll die.
