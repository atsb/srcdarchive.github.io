  Description :)
  Just like my last demo but with less SR50, I guess it's about time I learn
  that slow and steady wins the race...

  [Btw, 77% kills is maximum on this map (in UV) with out going to the exit on
  the right and with out the "-respawn" parameter.]

  
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 2:44 by me.
