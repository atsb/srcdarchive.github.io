| Oh my, I thought this game would never let me win...                   |
| There are two C-N entries on this map, both by Demonlord, both very    |
| old but very stylish. The problem was, Demonlord thought four          |
| chaingunners (which are constantly being resurrected) cannot be        |
| killed, so he ignored them. Both 2:39 and 2:43 demos are invalid       |
| UV -fast demos, let's say the truth.                                   |
|                                                                        |
| In order to correct the matter I wanted a 100% real kills demo below   |
| 2:39, as a slower demo would not be interesting IMO, after 15 years.   |
| Attaching a bonus demo, in which I assumed 3 rockets vs. already       |
| "injured" mancubus should be enough. The time was 2:38, the mancubus   |
| survived, NONE of these rockets did even 190 HP damage...              |
| At that moment the best legal run I had 2:40.03 and the best one with  |
| one missed kill was 2:34. Needless to say, I'm very happy with 2:32.   |
|                                                                        |
