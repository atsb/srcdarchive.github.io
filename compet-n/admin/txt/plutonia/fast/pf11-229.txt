  Description :)
  Yay! Over a minute below par!
  
  I'm pretty happy that I still got it in me to compete here at COMPET-N,
  even if it's only against my self. I was getting worried I would go a year
  without a record. I've been very busy studying Networking and computer
  stuff in general so that I can get a decent job, and there's been little
  time for Doom or for anything of please for that matter. 
  
  This is quite a pleasant demo, at least from my point of view -- as I
  improved my previous record by 5 seconds. I've learned a lot from
  studying Ancalagon's demos. The basics is: never get stuck on anything and
  never miss a shot (even if it means navigating somewhat more slowly, SSG
  reloads take a long time); but the less obvious is this: always move
  forward, don't kill as you go, shoot as you go, and as you backtrack
  throughout the map after obtaining the necessary keys to advance or exit
  -- finish them off quickly! I must say, I have a long way to go before
  mastering that last step, and I think few Doomers have. If the practice
  was applied more regularly and rigorously, many of the Ultimate Doom max
  runs could be improved by at least 5 seconds, some even 10.
  
  The not getting stuck part was previously very hard for me, but as Kimo
  had always told me, don't overdo SR50 :)
  
  ...I got really lucky with that third-to-last Arch-Vile.

  [Btw, 77% kills is maximum on this map (in UV) with out going to the exit on
  the right and with out the "-respawn" parameter.]

  
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 2:34 by me, timestamped:
