  Description :)
  This record is shit, it's absolutely something I shouldn't distribute to
  COMPET-N but I'm sending it anyway because I'm quite proud that I could
  overcome my handicaps. My parents for years warned me of Carpal Tunnel
  Syndrome and so I always made sure my wrists weren't bend upwards. But
  lately I've been developing another syndrome, I forget the medical term
  it's called but it's caused from having the wrists bent forward all the
  time. It's very painful and moving my hands is very hard, thus, my mouse
  aiming is a little fucked up. Over the past few years, I've noticed slight
  pains in my wrists but just thought it was do to stress. When my mom get's
  stressed, her rheumatoid arthritis kicks in and she always feels it in the
  wrists first. It's gotten worse and worse and worse for me, but since it's
  spring brake where I live, there shouldn't be much stress going on now
  should there? It wasn't long before I figured out what was causing my
  pain, and since I've been playing a lot, the pain really increased. 
  
  Starting about 3 days ago, I had to strictly stop playing Doom because my
  wrist where so bad. Just today I got back into it, and thus I'm making
  very shitty demos. But I'm very grateful that I can still play and
  hopefully my damage isn't permanent and as I slowly change my habits,
  hopefully the damage won't continue.
  
  But here's some more info, my right wrist had it worse by far, and I was
  wondering why. I have relatively big hands and my pinky finger always
  slides off the right end of the mouse and when I grip the mouse, my pinky
  is below the other four fingers significantly. Over years and years of
  using the mouse, this has cause my pinky and digitus annularis
  (right hand ring finger) to be malformed. I just noticed it a few days
  ago when I was examining my wrists. The curve in the mouse also added
  slight damage but it's nothing significant though after a few more years
  of using a mouse with such a curve, who knows what damage could occur. I
  use the Logitech Wireless Mouse M505 just so you know. The first thing
  I'm going to do is get a wider mouse, because my malformed fingers are
  really disturbing and are causing allot of pain.
  
  But anyways, happy Pi day :]
