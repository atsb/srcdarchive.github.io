Description:  Hmmm... Thought thisone would be very hard at first
	      sight especially the chaingunners that are revived
	      by the Archviles seemed to be hell..
	      However... this level has a lot of health and ammo
	      (plasma, rockets) and also an Invulnarability+
	      a bluresphere they both help A LOT.
	      I think that without the spheres thisone would be
	      nearly impossible...
	      Very funny level once you've learned it, quite
	      a lot like Punisher.wad or plutonia level 32.....
