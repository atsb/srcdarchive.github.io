  C-N entry #6.		Date:03/03/2011

  Description :)
  Wow it's been a long time since I broke a C-N record, and it's been a long
  time since Ive played Doom. Since my last entry in April 2010 I haven't been
  playing much of anything, but today I decided to play some and, after two
  hours I did what I had given up on a long time ago. I don't think I'll be
  making any more demos, but I don't know. I still love Doom but braking
  records isn't really important to me anymore, now that I know so much more
  about this crazy world. But I wont get into that, just enjoy the demo :)

  
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 2:45 by Xit Vono.
