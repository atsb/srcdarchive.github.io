  Description :)
  I hope Ryback knows how deeply appreciative I am of his concern for my
  wrist, it means a lot to me. Very few people in my life have shown any
  concern for me, regardless of how serous the situation is.
  
  Here's what Ryback wrote in PF19-241.TXT:
   "When I started recording this I hadn't seen Archy's updated 3:11, 
    just the 3:51. Plenty of scrappy, hard fought playing, but the 
    route looked like it could be made a lot more systematic. I 
    think this way is the maxkill route, I haven't watched any of 
    any of the records to make sure. So this is a first attempt
    at that and it can no doubt be pushed a lot further. Really the 
    only bit of the level that should be trickier with -fast is 
    handling the pain elementals. 
    
    And Archy, about the wrist pain, try keyboard only! :) To be 
    serious, I used to have a very mouse-intensive job involving
    mapping software, and after about a year or so developed this
    persistent, uncontrollable twitch underneath my right thumb and
    forefinger. After a two week break it went away. Just give the
    hand a rest and it may heal itself."
    
  I achieved PF19-311 by using... well I'll just show you what's in
  PF19-311.TXT, it's will be much easier that way. Here's PF19-311.TXT:
   "Much better than my shit PF19-351, I've overcome my wrist pain by using
    just the keyboard when ever possible, i.e. not in a "sticky" situation."
    
  In this run, I did the Keyboard-mouse combo the whole time, but I've been
  practicing using JUST the keyboard. My second best time on this map
  killing all monsters and getting all secrets with the -FAST parameter
  while use just the keyboard was 2:54; my fastest time using just the
  keyboard was 2:5x; I think it was 2:51 but I was quitting pretty fast when
  I saw a time above 2:40, so I'm not quite sure. Wish I hadn't overwritten
  that demo, would've been a great file to attach to PF19-233.ZIP, I
  could've let the world see my progress... but you're probably not
  interested in that anyway; so ya.
  
  I don't know if I'll ever get to the point of being able to brake
  COMPET-N records using just the keyboard but I must say, 2:54 is a pretty
  decent time.
  
  Anyways, this is a good start. Thank you once again Ryback, and that was
  quite an excellent rout.

  
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 2:41 by Ryback
