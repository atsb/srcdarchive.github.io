Description: Well...just played until I reached the exit. Quite diferent
             route compared to Daniel "Demonlord" Lindgren's 8:32, think
             its faster- but also more dangerous.

             Note: Cause Final Doom's exe cant handle the joyb_speed31, I
             used the originall Doom2.exe (1.9). So, to get a correct
             playback of this lmp, you'll have to run plutonia.wad 
             together with Doom2's exe...got it? :)
