Description:

This was an insane map on UV-Fast. It depended on luck too much 
when I went to a soul sphere or I entered the red key's door. If 
a good infighting didn't happened between chaingunners, I received 
many bullets from various directions and died in an instant even 
if I had over 100 health. Spectres were also a little tricky. They 
often obstructed my jump. I just tried the map for warming up, but 
under 2 min is so good.
