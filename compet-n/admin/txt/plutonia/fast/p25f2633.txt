Description: One of the hardest levels I've ever played, and with
	     -fast monsters...........it's HELL.
	     In the Hell Knight room I found no good strategy at all,
	     the only thing I noticed was that the Baron Of Hell do 
	     not teleport if you never leave the platform, he can't 
	     "telefrag" you, so this made him piece of cake. I have yet 
	     no strategy on the remaining 6 Hell Knights, I try to kill at 
	     least 2 before going to the "backside" with the Chaingunners, 
	     but sometimes you die before you know whats going on...
	     Left the Megasphere to the end, mainly because I thought
	     that the Chainees would hurt me more than they did......
     	     At last, if you want a real challenge try this with -fast
	     monsters...........I had NightMares.
