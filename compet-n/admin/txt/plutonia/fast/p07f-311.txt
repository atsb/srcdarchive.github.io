Description: Thought I'd give it a try, it's pretty hard even 
	     in UV so I didn't expect things to get much easier..
	     Revenents are hell, Barons of hell are not.
	     Not much to do about the Archvile, just stand and pray
	     he stops teleporting and that some rockets hopefully
	     hits him.
	     This is NOT an easy level, but once you've killed the
	     Mancubus and the Revenents the remaining part is piece 
	     of cake...
