  Description: This is too good a level to just give up :)
               The bit where I skipped the SSG was *not* in the
               original plan, which got me confused for a bit,
               and later attempts to conserve ammo were not
               very effective.  At this point I was expecting a very bad
               time :)
               But the spider-revenant battle went well,
               with most monsters in that arena killed for me.
