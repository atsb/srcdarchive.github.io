  Doom2 -playdemo with Doom2.exe Version 1.9 - Only

  Final Doom - Level 31 - "Cyberden" - Plutonia.wad

  Kills   100%
  (Items  100)            
  Secrets 100%  and Time   7:38
                           ----

Description: Full credits go to Claudio and his 6:48 demo.
	     Better bfg use could put this around 5:30, but 
	     that would be herding the Cybers for a BFG or 2.
	     I tried a speedrun on here, but once there are
	     3 Cybers active it becomes very annoying.

	     (this space for rent)   :P
	     I'd like to say 'HI' to all the Compet-n players
	     out there... especially Adam for his great job 
	     running this thing.

	     recorded with doom2 -file plutonia.wad
	     but playsback with either.
