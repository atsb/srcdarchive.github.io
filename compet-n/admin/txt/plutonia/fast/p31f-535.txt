Description: I'm sorry Albert for stealing your first point, but this is
             one of my favourite TNT map. I think you shouldn't give up and
             beat some more TNT demos. There are lot of demos that really 
             need improvement.  Btw. Talented or not talented, mostly is
             that about free time and patience. :)
