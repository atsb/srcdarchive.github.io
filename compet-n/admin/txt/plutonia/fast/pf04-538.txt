  Description: I haven't yet watched Xit's demo, so I don't know which way
               he went. I wanted a route where I could use the big weapons
               on the big monsters. The plasma gun is hard to reach early,
               but the rocket launcher is easy enough to reach.
               Once you've got it you only have to worry about the PEs
               (themselves proof that Plutonia was never meant to be
               played with -fast :), stray revenant shots, and cacos
               sneaking up on you from behind... which happens
               surprisingly often!
