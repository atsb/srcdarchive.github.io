| I tried avoiding copying anyone, I believed Henning / stx-Vile UV Max  |
| route was too difficult with -fast monsters, didn't try to learn it,   |
| now I'm not so sure about its difficulty. The beginning was based on   |
| George Bell's UV -fast demo, the rest is mine. Should be easily        |
| improved by any other player with a critical eye, I don't feel like    |
| inventing new routes here ATM.                                         |
|                                                                        |
| One of my two favourite Plutonia maps (the other one is MAP26).        |
| Wonderful non-linearity, superb item placement, fantastic, non-orthodox|
| texture choice, this map simply rocks.                                 |
|                                                                        |
