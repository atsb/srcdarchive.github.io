  Description: While playing through this level I thought of a way
               to improve the route. It saves a few seconds, but more
               importantly, makes things a lot easier, giving you
               more successes to choose from. Even so, this still has
               a stupid falldown, and the end might have gone faster, so
               under three minutes is certainly in reach.
               Nice exit frame on that chaingunner though... :)
