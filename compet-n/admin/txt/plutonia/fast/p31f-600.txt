Description: Not much to say, except that this is my very first entry here at Compet-N.
	     ...and probably there won't be many more, since I feel I'm not that talented to keep
	     uploading demos here every now and then.
	     Hope this record longs for at least some minutes... :)
	     Most of the credits to Doug Merrill and his previous entry for this map.
	     Oh, and to Adam Hegyi, for mantaining such a brilliant demo site.
