  The Plutonia Experiment – Map 19 – UV Fast

I have a good reason to start smashing people's faces in with hammers right now. This level is BRUTAL! Many things would kill me, like my own rockets, not getting into a safe place for the imps in time, as well as the fact that it would only lower once, meaning if I got 99% kills, I'd scream. I even got so nervous that at the end, I picked up some rockets which I don't even need. At least I did it.
