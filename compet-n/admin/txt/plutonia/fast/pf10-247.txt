===================================
Description:

In the early stage, I had to run through many chaingunners without an armor. 
There was a blur artifact but it was not enough. A lot enemies after a yellow 
key fought against each other easily for fast monsters, so it often brought 
the good result. However, I frequently killed myself by blast damage of RL 
and couldn't deal with the rest of enemies smoothly for many lost souls. It 
therefore was not easy to get under 3 min.
