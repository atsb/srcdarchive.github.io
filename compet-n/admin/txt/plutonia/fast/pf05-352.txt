  Description :)

  When I first exited and saw 100% kills I was a little worried
  cause usually arch-viles revive at least one monster, but
  I ran it back with timer.exe and it said 0 monsters left.
  anyways, I haven't had any problems with those stray monsters
  in Plutonia like I do in other level sets.  As for the demo,
  it was pretty easy.  If you have bad luck the spider will be
  facing the wrong way so you can't get it in a fight with
  other monsters.  That ending was cool, I was about 1 inch from
  being blasted by that archie.
