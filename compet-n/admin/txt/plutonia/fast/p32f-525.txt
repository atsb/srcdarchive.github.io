Description: Uhum...how did this happen. I was getting times around the
	     06:20-06:00 area...then this. Infights worked like a dream
	     on the ledges tho, might have something to do with it.
	     Special thanks to Claudio Barba for inspiering me to do this.
	     Note the time stamp on the demo btw :)

             [To playback this lmp, you'll have to run plutonia.wad
