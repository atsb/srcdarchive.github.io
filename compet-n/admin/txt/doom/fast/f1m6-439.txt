Description:  Another one done during my DANG runs :). My first attempt was
              a 5:23, only 30 secs off the record and I knew it was slow,
              so I had a quick bash at getting a time using the non -fast
              route - which isn't actually as hard as you'd think, hardest
              part is getting the 30 second door trick to work. I first
              recorded a 4:47 which I deleted by accident, so had to make
              this :)
