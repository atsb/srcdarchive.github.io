  Description:  Demons! I tried to leave them for when I get the BFG, but 
                there were to many of them. This is a great map. I remember
                how long it took me to finish it when I first started playing
                Doom. It's a little sloppy, but it is the fastest time I got.
                On to trying to fill up the rest of the empty slots.
                Hope you like it.
                Demonlord were are you?
