Description: You guys just don't want me to play any other map huh. When I saw Chris's lmp I
             thought for sure it was Radek:-) I guess I play this map more than any other
             because I'm always defending it.
             Of course caco placement is the key to a fast time on this map.
             Long live Doom!!!
