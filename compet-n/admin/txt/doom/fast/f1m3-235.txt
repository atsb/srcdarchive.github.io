  Description :)
  I've held on to this since October 25. I wanted to do better.
  I just don't have the time to play Doom anymore. I hope players
  continue to submit entries to Compet-n, and I hope CNDoom fares
  well. This may be my last entry. I've said that before and
  obviously I've been wrong and I may be wrong once again, but I
  possess a sad degree of certainty this time.

  Doom has meant a lot to me. Compet-n has meant a lot to me.
  Thank you, fx, for maintaining such a great legacy. My
  adolescences has been spent competing for this site.
  I really can't thank you enough.

  By the way, COMPET-N record was 2:44 by me, dated:
  2015-10-03.
