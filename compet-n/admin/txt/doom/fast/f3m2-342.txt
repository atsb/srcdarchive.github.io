Description: One more empty space in COMPET-N... The interesting thing in this
             map is that each category requires a completely different route,
             otherwise it's a bit annoying and very confusing (my first try was
             5:29...) But after some more tries you find that nearly always 
             everything goes right, for example there are two moments when i
             turn around and see a demon or a spectre running behind. And that
             demon was always there, i didn't have to go and search for him a
             single time. However, i'm not a very good route planner, probably
             it's far from being optimized (as i said, this map is really 
             confusing :)

             Btw, while playing this map, i happened to kill a lost soul with
             a single SG shot _three_ times and i've never succeded to do that
             ever before, i didn't even know it was possible. Maybe this map is
             special? :)
