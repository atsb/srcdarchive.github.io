Beats my last record by 5 seconds. This demo shows off a pretty neat new
route that I reckon can save 1-2 secs over a normal time, more if you get
really lucky (if the trooper triggers the lift at exactly the right time,
you can kill one imp, three troopers, go down the lift, kills the imp and
the two troopers, come straight up without having to wait and kill the imp..
but that doesn't happen often :>). Knowing Adam H's luck he'll do it first
time and get a 1:48...<mumble, curse, mumble...>
