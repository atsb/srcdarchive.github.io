Description: Originally I wanted to throw some new -fast maps into Compet-N.
             After 5mins in f2m3 & f2m4 I gave up...I don't think anyone want
             to see .me in a f2m32000.lmp, running around and searching for
             secrets and monsters (:
             So I sticked to speedrunning (Hi Jan :) and did another 35 here.

             Uhh....Adam....thx for "defending" my f2m1 (((:
             At 2:01 I wanted to do this by my own....but this 1:52 just looked
             too good then....
