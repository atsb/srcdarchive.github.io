  Description:  I didn't hurry in that recording. The goal was to compare
                the difficulty of -Fast with -Respawn.
                Result:
                If you are playing just to survive -Respawn with 100% kills
                and secrets is BY FAR harder than -Fast. In -Fast you can
                always whimp out and hide behind corners and shoot only when
                there's no danger of getting hit.
                When playing -Respawn this strategy will fail soon because
                monsters will respawn faster than you kill them.
               
                I guess that if you are speeding -Fast will become much
                harder.

                I like that map!
