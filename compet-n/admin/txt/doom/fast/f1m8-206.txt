Description: I did this easy, ugly map cause I wanted to have 1 point
             altogether :) I think I was pretty lucky with the ratio of
             dead demons in the start, besides the exit-trap finished me of
             really quick! This recording can of course still be improved- but 
             anyway: Panter -0.5 points ;)
