  Why would one take the "standard" route? 
  With the route I took, lots of monsters are killed by other monsters,
  especially with -fast. 

  It's incredible how Thomas' record wasn't beaten for two years!
  I'm sure that this 0:39 will be erased soon by some Doomgod,
  like it happened to my r4m4 entry, but anyway, I'll be on the list
  for another week. :)
