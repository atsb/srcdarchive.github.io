  Description :)
  I'm not happy with this demo. I miss some very easy targets (like the
  human in the maze) and it took more than rockets to kill the spectres
  in the final room. This is a very frustrating map, the balancing act 
  at the beginning with the shotgunner often fails, and doomguy 
  apparently loves to purposefully avoid hitting barrels like it's his 
  mother. At the end demons love to run up to your face and induce 
  rocket-suicide, and before that humans love to hide upstairs (that 
  shotgunner couldn't hide though :).

  This could be done a lot faster. The monsters in the yellow key trap
  can ALL be killed with just three rockets with proper shot-placement, 
  and as I leave the yellow key room my final rocket was wasted on
  just a Sergeant and one imp. As I run into the final room, I
  needlessly waste a rocket, a rocket that could have been used to 
  finished off the last of the demons instead of the slow shotgun. 
  With some risky play, all the monsters in the locked area of the 
  final room can be killed with just a continuous blast of rockets.
  It requires walking towards the center of the room (after pressing
  the button) to wake up the monsters in the left compartment of the
  room, then quickly walking backwards to avoid suicide while blasting
  rockets. This is very frustrating because even more of the pinkies
  and spectres will lunge at you. It's much more reliable to do the 
  same without walking forward to wake the monsters towards your left,
  conserve three rockets, and finish off the the leftmost demons with
  the final three rockets after blasting everything else. Of course in
  this demo that doesn't work :(
