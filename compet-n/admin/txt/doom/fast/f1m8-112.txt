Description:	I don't enjoy playing this map, because there are so many
		things that must work - how many pigs you manage to kill in the
		beginning (whit the barrels), and it will help if the Spectres
		and the Demons kill each other in the end.

		This is not an optimised LMP, I wasted to mutch time killing
		the pigs in the beginning, and killing the Spectres and the
	        Demons in the end.
