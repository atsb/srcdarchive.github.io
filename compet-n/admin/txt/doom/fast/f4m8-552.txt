Description:   I really wanted to hold a Compet-N record but I am not able
               to beat any given times so I had to play with fast monsters
               for the first time. Was E4M8 -fast to hard for everybody or
               did you let the entry empty to give a Non God a fair chance?
               Anyway...
               With fast monsters the Shotgunners are a real pain, I never
               survived the start as seen in Anders's U4M8-250. I go twice
               to the goodie pillars because I want to have maximum Health
               and Armor when going for the big guys.
               You may notice that I am a Mun waster, bad BFG performancer,
               E4M8 lover and...
               I played as offensive as I could but the next record may be
               only half my time, though I think you won't be bored.
