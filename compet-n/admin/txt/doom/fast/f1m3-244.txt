  C-N entry #74.	Date: 2015.10.03

  Description :)
  I'd say a 20 second improvement warrants an upload. I was
  originally going to upload after getting under 2:50, but after
  getting 2:45, I just couldn't until I beat Radek by 20 seconds.
  Shame that pinky moved way before that rocket hit; killing him
  off with the shotgun took some seconds. The behavior of the
  first pinky and specre seem to be the biggest factor in ruining
  my runs.

  Previous times were: 3:01, 2:57, 2:50, and 2:45. Some big jumps
  there, maybe I'll get lucky and score a 2:3x soon.
     
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 3:04 by Radek Pecka, dated:
  2001-09-14.
