Description: Two Doom-crazy friends of mine "forced" me into doing this :)
             Damn ugly map...This a bit better than Panters -fast lmp 
             though, take an advice dude- stick to speedrunning :))
              
             Hopefully this won't tease you into beating my very first 
             Compet-N entry Panter :) This lmp can be improved by quite a bit,
             but I wont offer any more time on it...(I won't let Doom become
             my life as it has for my poor Norwegian fellows :))
