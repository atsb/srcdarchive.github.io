  Description:  This is a fun level, but not enough plasma or rockets to do
                fast. I lost a few seconds at a few spots, but I'm getting
                bored. Pretty hairy though,for a long demo I think it's 
                pretty exciting(non stop killing). DB shotgun would have made
                a big difference:-)
                On to trying to fill up the rest of the empty slots.
                Hope you like it.
                Demonlord were are you?
