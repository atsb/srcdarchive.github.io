  Why? Because it took 3 minutes to beat... :))
  Seriously: the point award is not just for the hardness of the category.
  Regular UV is much harder to beat than -fast!  

  This LMP is still SLOW compared to n2m8-035 by Panter... but I don't
  care... this one scores 0.5 points only :)

  BTW: it's not that harder in -fast, at least the cyber is easier to hit...
