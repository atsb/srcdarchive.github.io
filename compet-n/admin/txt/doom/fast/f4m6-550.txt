Description:   Man, what an improvement over my last time. Rini said it could
               be done under 6 min. and I got this in a couple of hours.
               Of course I could have never done it without seeing his last
               lmp. Thanks Rini for your encouragement. I'm sure it can be
               done faster, but not by me right now:-) I always liked this
               map and F4M6 was my first compet-n lmp, so I had to try to get
               it back.
               Demonlord where are you?
