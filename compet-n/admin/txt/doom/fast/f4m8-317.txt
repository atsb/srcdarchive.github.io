  Description:  I revisited my Doom1 nightmare collection and while watching
                my n4m8 recording thought that it should be fun on -fast as
                well. It is - as long as you do not try to be faster than
                3:30, then it starts to become a bit frustrating.
                Optimizing the time is surely not the same as optimizing the
                fun you have when playing ;-)
                Sorry, Ralf to take your only COMPET-N point, you surely
                can find som other maps to improve.

                If you wonder about the 100% kills and secrets:
                There is only one secret in that map, the sector with the
                chaingun. Use iddt-iddt to check that I killed all monsters
                (except some lost-souls, but they don't count for the kills
                ratio.
