Description:  had a thought about my old route and wasn't that
              satisfied... so i changed it slightly.

              to lure the barons out of their corners, i get the
              backpack in the very beginning.

              and since you have to stay in the room as a bait
              for the barons, you can also get the keys first
              instead of waiting. this time all 4 barons actually
              walked into the room.

              ...and this time, i'm first! the last two times,
              first with the record at 1:16 and i played 1:14
              only to see another 1:14 already in the /incoming.
              so i played 1:11 and what happend? a 1:08 in the
              /incoming. quite anoying, but nice COMPET-N... :-)
