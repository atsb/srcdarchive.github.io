Description: Since this is my very first lmp, I'm satisfyed with the result, 
             and I've got nothing to complain about :)) 
             Nasty those lostsouls btw...took me some minutes to make this lmp.
             Why the heck does this only give 0.5 points?? Its surly harder to
             play -fast than regular uv (in most maps anyway...)
