As you can all see, this is a lightyear from optimal. If one
1.Kills the two sergeants on the top of the stairs with one shot
2.clears the next room with _three_ shots and 3.kills the two
sergeants in the secret corridor with one shot (it took me three)
and 4.runs fast, I would say 0:30 could be done. It would require
a Sedlo or an AdamH though. :)
