  Description :)
  My goal was 2:24. I wanted to beat Anders Johnsen by 30
  seconds. I've spent a lot of time on this map and learned
  quite a lot about it, but the simplest thing to take away is
  that if you want UV-FAST records, just fallow the MAX rout
  more closely than the record-holder did. This fallows the MAX
  rout quite closely, though weapon usage is much different.
  I'm disappointed that the door behind the final imp didn't
  raise, that could have saved 2 seconds if an invisible pinky
  died there. The barrel switch incident is also embarrassing.
  I tried to improve this demo for a few hours but I'm ready to
  move on to other maps. The time is good enough that I don't
  have to worry about someone else beating this on a simple whim.
     
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 2:28 by me, dated:
