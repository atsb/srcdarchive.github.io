  Description:	This is infact a fun level to play. There is only one, or
		shall I say two problems:
			1. - Low on health
			2. - Low on ammo
		These two problems forces you to play the level a bit slow and
                chicken like.

		When watched it may look easy, but problem one and two 
                make this level hard on -fast. So, at some stages I play 
                safe and slow...
