  Description :-)

  After Kai took maxkills with 0:51 I decided I won't play this level anymore.
  But now with 0.5 point for -fast I decided to play again...
  Now about the level itself:
  This level should be easier with -fast than normal UV because of the
  monsterfights... Well I thought I could get into low 50s but I didn't
  succeed. Maybe someone else will (Kai?)
  Anyway I'm happy to be under 1 minute and to beat Poeppy (again).
