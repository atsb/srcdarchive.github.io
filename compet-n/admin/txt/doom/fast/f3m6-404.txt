                >Rini Hi Joe, I hope you don't mind that I finished off all

                >pretty bad recordings I did not practise them alot.

                No problem my last time was slow anyway. Hope you don't
                mind I stole some of your route:-) I did practice them a lot.
                I see how good you really are. I know you can get a faster
                time.

                >Hmmm, in fact it was the easiest of those -Fast recordings

                I'm no Anders or even a Rini:-) Pretty soon he will have all the
                fastest times. I was going to go for some Tyson recordings
                and I see he has put up times on the maps I was working on that
                seem unreachable for me. I guess the ultimate challange would
                be to beat some of his times, but I guess I would have to quit
                my job and leave my wife and kid:-)
                Demonlord were are you?
