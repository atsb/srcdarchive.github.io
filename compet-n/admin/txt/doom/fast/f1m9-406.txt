  Description:	In fact I like this level, I love the way it's built......:)
		But there is one problem! I hate playing this level -Fast.
		The fast movements and shoting from the enemies, force you to 
		play "chicken-stile". You need to stay in the end of the
		stairs, hide behind corners.............:( Oh Well.......

		I'm sure that - this map can be done much faster. I finished 
		whit one rocket left, missed to much whit the shotgun, and so
		on.
