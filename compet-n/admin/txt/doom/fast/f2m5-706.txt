Description:  Strange things happend in this recording...I heard sounds  
              (nope, not skulls), still everything was dead...Maybe I'm
              starting to get a paranoia :-) I also turned before exiting
              and lost some 8-10 secs cause I heard a skull (thought it
              was a lost pig). Anyway, its below 10 mins now...
