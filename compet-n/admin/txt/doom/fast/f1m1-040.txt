  Description :-)

  Tjenare Peo, gamle man!  :-)  Just thought I'd quickly prove that
  the standard 100/100 route works with -Fast monsters as well (you
  wouldn't want to know any details though ... like, say, "How many
  times did you die in the room with the four shotgunners?" or "How
  many times did you die in the room with the zig-zag pathway?" ;-)

  [ .BAT stuff snipped for briefness - it was getting old anyway! ]
