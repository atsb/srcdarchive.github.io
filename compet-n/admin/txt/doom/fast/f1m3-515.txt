  Description :-)

  Tough first two minutes. Off course it can be beaten,
  but only by the "German speaking players" ;-)

  For the judge ! "This .LMP is tested on two different
  computers !"

[  Admin. Note ;-)  But it only has to work on ONE... MINE ;-)

   Seriously: If a .LMP works OK on one PC it WILL work on ANY
   other PC... assuming the DooM .EXE and .WAD's are the same.

   Also - Many Congrats on being the first of the four(!) Last
   DooM II Grand Masters with D2GM-PS2 and ThanX for the offer
   of a beer or six (next time I'm in Sweden) for uploading it
   BEFORE the other "pretenders" "sneeked in" before that nice
   Mr. Lmps chap passed it ! ;-) [ See F23-2248.TXT ]
