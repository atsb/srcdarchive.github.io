Description:
Haven't been playing much Doom lately, but seeing Archy recording all his 
UV -fast records just gave me the urge to join in. Bit of a shame that
the record I chose was one of mine, but it really was dire and in major
need of improvement. Hopefully a 47 second improvement is worth it.

It's strange, I've always thought of this level as one of the most 
frustrating to try and play -fast style, with 360 degree attack fields 
for most of the level's duration and lost souls everywhere. Yet this 
didn't take long at all and I got into the level's rhythm very quickly.
You still need a good deal of luck, but only at a few points, while the
rest is consistent and repeatable. This run went very well, the only major 
problem being the need to kill the imp down in the pit (sometimes he'll 
be killed for you) while a lost soul was distracting me. Probably lost
about 3 seconds there. Still, equalling the max record isn't too shabby.
