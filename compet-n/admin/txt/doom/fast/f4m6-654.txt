  Description:  I just watched Joe's f3m9-249. Congrats Joe, this must've
                been a tough one. Then I remebered a mail of Joe, where he
                invited me for a little competition in f4m6. I won't go
                for any LMP competitions anymore, but I somehow thought
                that doing f4m6 might be enjoyable.

                ... and it was, this recording took me only 10 minutes,
                and this gives me a GOOD feeling. I did not expect it to
                be so easy. Ok, I had no time to practise, that's why I
                missed the red key several times and almost forgot the
                soulsphere. In fact I did not plan that route, I just started
                playing.

                And now Joe, you surely can do it close to 6:00, or even
                below. The "unofficial" record is 6:15 done by Esko,
                the recording in which he showed the great red key trick to
                me. (You surely remember, it has been this trick that made me
                 go for n4m6!).
