  Description :-)

  Sorry Cowboy, but if you wanna keep your COMPET-N points, then you should
  work hard for them.
  The route itself is the same, a little improved use of the RL...
  Sorry Rini that it's not Pacifist, maybe I'll make it some time...
  IMHO 0:23 is possible, 0:22 only for .EXE players.
