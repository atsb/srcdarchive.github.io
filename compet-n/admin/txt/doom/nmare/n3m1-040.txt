Description: Hmmmmmmm....sorry Hegyi....
             I think it is no fun to beat people who don't care about their
             points...and in the moment I only see Hegyi also playing for
             Compet-N.

             I just want a little bit more challenge in these things, and still
             nobody beat only one of my entries...
             So Hegyi: please try this map again...I won't go for a 38..(:
