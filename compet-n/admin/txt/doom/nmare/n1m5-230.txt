  Items   : 55%
  Secrets : 77%
  Time    : 02:30
  Par     : 02:45

  Comments: For a long time the speed record for this map was 03:14 by
Andi Kren, then in July or August I completed it in 02:58. I began to 
wondering if I could beat that, and I then began to wonder if it could be 
done under par on nm, as e1m7 has. 

I tried it a few times, but kept dying, which is unusual for me in this map. 
Then I realised I was trying to go about the same speed as my latest uv LMP
which I showed to Richard Sham (time = 1:48). This is just too fast for nm
skill, so I took it at the speed I did it when playing on UV under par (for
the free interpretation in my DOOM Velox exam).

And so it happened ... 02:30
