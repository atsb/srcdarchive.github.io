  Description :-)

  I thought I'd try for a .LMP of this mission... On NightMare! AND
  Under the Par Time - I already had a N2M3-031.LMP, so I just KNEW
  it would be possible - AND it happened ! Not by just one or a few
  seconds, but TWELVE !!!

  A DooM (1) Incubus "hard" level, completed (well) UNDER PAR ! :-)


  I love the smell of freshly fried NightMare! Demons... ;-)

  It smells like... ... ... VICTORY !!!


  /Me holds out pan with E2M3-NM!-Under-PAR Spectre cooking:

  Here, have a smell...

  Beat THAT !


  If you can find some way of not needing to go for the soul-sphere
  plus "bonus" cells, you will make it even faster - And maybe even
  under one minute ?!? ;-) Good luck in trying... LOTS ! :-)

 Ah, the nurse is bringing me my cute new BLACK jacket - it doesn't
 show up the blood stains too badly ;-) BUT I just don't understand
 why it has to be so TIGHT !?! AND how am I supposed to hold onto a
 mouse with NO hands... I'm training, I'm training...
