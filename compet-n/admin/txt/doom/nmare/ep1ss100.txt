  Description :-)

  Hi to you all. Had a lot of time over the weekend and decided to
  record all of the EP1 maps the way I did in my D1SG-AAK: shotgun
  only plus (to add some spice ;-) 100% secrets (except for N1M8 :).
  This is DooM like I love it, the classic maps played the classic
  way. It's really a pity that I played the last three maps (N1M3,
  E1M7 and N1M8) with a permanent speed key and that's why those
  entries look different. I tried this one day ago and today only
  noticed that I play so damned hectic, but couldn't remember what
  I did one day before :-) However, N1M3 I played much too often,
  N1M7 I couldn't do within the next few tries and N1M8 was just
  too good to be true, so I didn't re-record any of these. What I
  re-recorded was N1M1, yes :-), it looked rather bad to me and I
  could do in my first try (wow :-). The same with N1M2 and N1M4.
  N1M5 is surely the most exciting one to watch. When I re-watched
  all of the .LMP's before I uploaded them I couldn't believe how
  I made them.

  Ciao
