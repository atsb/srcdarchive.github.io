  Description:

  Well, not the easiest NM level... I was killed two times by the imps in the
  cage when running to the blue door, and once i made all the way to the exit
  but that last jump failed and i fell into the slime. That was soooooo
  frustrating!!! But if i can survive this far one time, i'll succeed once
  more eventually :) So i went on and after a few tries i really succeeded
  but i was close (watch the health while i was preparing for the jump :)

  Actually, this wasn't meant for COMPET-N, e1m9 was the only ep1 level that
  i hadn't made in NM so i wanted to fill this gap. But as the only NM lmp i
  found of this map was Anton Magleli's 2:22 record, i decided to upload this
  one... This is the only time i reached the exit and i don't think i'm gonna
  try this anymore :)
