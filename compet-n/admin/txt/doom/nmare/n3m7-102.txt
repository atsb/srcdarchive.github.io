It seems I'm kinda obsessed by these
maps full of demons. I was practising
it since it's my main problem when I
go for an e3nm and I got 1:06 first
exit with a lot of mistakes so I thought
that the record should be beatable.

Well, here it is, not a really seducing
demo but I'm still happy with it.

Under 1:00 is doable IMO.
