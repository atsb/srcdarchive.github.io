  Description :-)

Well, this jump gets easier and easier with practise :). This was much,
much easier than I had expected...you have to trust to luck a little to
get through the three pinkies, but apart from that it's even slightly
easier than UV, as you have 4 rockets to play with. Only took 4 or 5
tries. I was a bit suprised to make the jump, the rocket seemed to have
exploded too far away...once again, this route and the jump are by
Andy Kempling, AKA Aurican, awesome trick :)
