Description : My second compet-n entry!!!
              Yes Adam, UV is just the same like NM. The new UV time is 00:15 
              and so I thouht 00:15 is also possible (without strafe50). And 
              here it is. :-)
              I think 00:14 is possible (without strafe50). But I don't want  
              try it. Hey Adam try to beat me!!!
