  Description :)

  Hi folks.  I thought I'd try this cause I noticed 30 sec.
  seems kinda slow for a map where the UV record is 27.
  This one is pretty much done the same way as UV, but it's
  a bit slower, since you need to avoid getting hurt at the
  beginning, and those pigs tend to get in the way often.
  I lost some time with that door so I knew that to have a
  chance at 29 I must use wallrun at the end, so thanks
  Ocelot for telling me about this trick.  If everything
  goes great I would say 28 is possible, but who will try?
  Vince? Adamh?
