  Description :-)

  Hmmm... quite interesting that pacifist or near-pacifist route of you
  guys, but I think this route makes things faster...
  Played this quite a lot now, I wanted to do that jump to the exit
  but it didn't come. Maybe I'll do it in another life... Under 1:00 is 
  definately possible with that jump... (which is, quite funny, because
  UV Speed record is 0:59)
