  Description :)

  As AdamW said, it's possible to do this without killing the
  caco, but it's already hard enough as it is and having that
  caco alive would make things much harder.  I died many times
  after the red key, but finally things worked out and I was
  able to finish in a decent time.  Previous exits were 1:26,
  1:23, 1:20 and 1:23.
