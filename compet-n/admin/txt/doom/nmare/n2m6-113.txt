IN YOUR FACE DOOM.EXE!

This is one of the maps where you
feel the game just doesn't want
you to get to the exit. I died at
the last doors 3 times DAMMIT!

But hey, I got my best demo thanks
to that.

I was pretty much shaking like hell
after I took the red key, I couldn't
believe the luck I was having and I
almost failed to open the door with
a pig biting my scared ass. Phew.

I think this is one solid record,
1:10 would be optimal but don't try
it if you wanna stay healthy.
