Chris:

Of course, you insane players out there will want to do this
the UVspeed way...


Well, not quite :). I _did_ go for the key first though, it's not *so* hard,
really. Bloody irritating run, this. All sorts of things can go wrong,
although admittedly most of mine involved killing myself with rockets :).
I'm glad this one worked because it's the fastest of all the runs I nearly
completed, I have various 1:00 and 1:03 dying-near-the-exits.
