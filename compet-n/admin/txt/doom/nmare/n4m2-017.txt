I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that 0:17
on the screen. I had done :18 on prboom before
and I thought it was impossible to go faster on
nightmare... .

Something strange happened here. There was almost
no cacos around the platform. Watching the demo I
felt that maybe the jump could have been done
without shooting at them?! I never saw something
like that before so I didn't wanna spoil the run
but maybe with extreme luck it can be done...I
dont know.

Anyway enjoy the run I won't go for 0:16 :-)
