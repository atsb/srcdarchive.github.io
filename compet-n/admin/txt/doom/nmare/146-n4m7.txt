  Description:  I've collected maps for a complete doom-nm single level
                collection. I don't know if I have enough time to complete
                n4m1, but I've done all the rest.
                This LMP shows that it is possible to complete n4m7
                w/o the health ever dropping below 100%.

                Btw:
                If you don't know how to determine the MMH, that's how:
                Watch the health everytime the player takes damage, and take
                the smallest value of the whole recording. If the player takes
                no damage at all, the health at the exit counts.
