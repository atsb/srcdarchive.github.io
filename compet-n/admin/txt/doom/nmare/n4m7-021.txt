The pacifist lmp by Yonatan and the speed lmp by Daniel gave me the idea to
try their route on NM as well. It worked although I fumbled a bit with the
hidden exit switch (I died there earlier). I hoped I could do it faster but
compared to on UV you really have to kill all sergeants at the start and find
a clear path between the pigs to do the strafe on jump (it can actually be
done with a normal strafe jump but then it must be a perfect one)..
