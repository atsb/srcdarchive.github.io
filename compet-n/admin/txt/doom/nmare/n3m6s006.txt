  Description:  Oh, yes one everlasting point for poor little Rini ;-))))
                I collected eight 0:07 before thisone. The fastest before
                was a 0:07.05


                Btw:
                All the strafe50 running is 'handmade', no strafe50 driver
                or other cheats, just the [STRAFE ON] key. I have to make
                this explicit here, because when looking at gametics like

                GF50 SR50                       #     161 (00:04.60)
                GF50 SR50                       #     162 (00:04.62)
                GF45 SR50                       #     163 (00:04.65)
                GF50 SR40 TR8                   #     164 (00:04.68)
                GF50 SR40 TR4                   #     165 (00:04.71)
                GF50 SR40 TR1                   #     166 (00:04.74)
                GF50 SR50                       #     167 (00:04.77)
                GF50 SR50                       #     168 (00:04.80)
                GF50 SR50                       #     169 (00:04.82)

                everybody would assume the (ab)use of a strafe50 driver.
