Description: 

A more difficult start technique saves much time here. No need to shoot the
right hand side sergeant, and if the enemies work out right you can do the
first platform after just one shotgun shot. It took me two tries to get the
BFG here, so I think optimal is 0:21. The running here is close to perfect.
Sorry to take almost your last points Selim...
This is of course secret exit and nm100s record.
