  Description:  Sorry Patrick, I did not watch your 1:47. But as you said
		something about "Pacifist style" I guess my strategy is very
		similar. The time depends very much on how fast the spectres
		eat the barons, pure luck IMHO.
		BTW:
		This is my first COMPET-N lmp played with mouse.
		Looks rather ugly, huh.

		.. and for those who don't know "DooM - Pacifism"
