  Description:  No great performance, but a lucky one, and ...
                with the maximal Minimum Health I've ever seen in that level!
                (and I really scanned the whole internet to find a safer one)
                I played this just for fun and discovered later that this
                recording is the "safest" one. That's why I wasted the
                fantastic health of 53% at the imps near the supercharge so
                carelessly.
                I tried to get a safer recording afterwards, but luck was
                against me.
               
                Try to beat that 37%!

                Btw:
                If you don't know how to determine the MMH, that's how:
                Watch the health everytime the player takes damage, and take
                the smallest value of the whole recording. If the player takes
                no damage at all, the health at the exit counts.
