  Description :-)

  I actually recorded this .LMP while training for DooM 1 Incubus.
  Now I have done both "impossible" Maps (E1M3 and E1M5) with 100%
  secrets. So this is not thought as a Speed entry, although that
  only the time counts - I tried to kill every single monster at
  least once as seen in Steffen Winterfeldt's Version for DooM 1.2
  (see the DHT homepage for that incredible .LMP)
