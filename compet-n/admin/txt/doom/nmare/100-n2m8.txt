  Description :-)

  This level is almost too easy even on NightMare! :-) I decided to
  leave the MegaSphere untouched ... "Winners don't use drugs!" ;-)
  I ran out of rockets in the final showdown, but I really couldn't
  be bothered to get some new ones  -  so I finished off Cybie with
  that "fully automatic rapid fire combat pistol".  Don't worry, it
  only took a few more shots to get him down, so you probably won't
  fall asleep while watching. ;-)

  [ .BAT stuff snipped for briefness - it was getting old anyway! ]
