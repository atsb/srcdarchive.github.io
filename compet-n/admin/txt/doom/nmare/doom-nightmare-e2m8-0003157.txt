Time     : 31.57
===================================
Description: Dozen of attempts and multiple 33-35 time demos later, well I got around 31 seconds, even if it is
behind the Compet-N record by 1 second (though CNDoom has a separate database so...). I would try again
for at least 30 but I can't say I am fond of relying on RNG to get me the time there, especially since it took
me longer than I thought to get 31.57. I guess this works.
