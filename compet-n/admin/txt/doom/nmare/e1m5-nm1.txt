  Description :-)

  This is one of the two hardest maps for the DHT5 title D1 Incubus
  I'm currently training for (the other is E1M3), although this MAP
  is easier than E1M3 (with 100 % secrets of course ;-)

  ( See Steffen Winterfeldt's wonderful (Ver. 1.2) .LMP on the DHT5
    Homepage  http://www.cam-orl.co.uk/~fms/dht.html )

  Got another version but this is the better one. It's difficult to
  describe all the tricks I use, I'll explain everything to anybody
  who wants to know them exactly (via email). There's still one big
  mistake I make - Before I get the blue key, I spent a rocket in a
  pinkie's (and my) face, which made me a bit nervous for the next
  few seconds, but what shall's ;-) ? (I don't mind)

  The playing speed is very high (normally I play SLOW on NightMare
  !) but here it is impossible because of all the Demons & Spectres
  and their permanent respawning.

  [ There is a bug in the doom engine. If you save a NightMare game
  and load it again - the monsters respawn but are not FAST at all.
  (This does not occur with every re-load, but after the first time
  "the bug" stays.) I solved this with the -LOADGAME # -FAST option
  (ThanX to ZlatkO). It makes it easier to play levels like this if
  you're able to train at all the separate situations. I can really
  recommend this sort of training for everyone. (Except Steffen.EXE
  :-) of course ;-) ]

  BTW: Hunter Hoof is wrong again... :-) (Sent him the .LMP ;-)
