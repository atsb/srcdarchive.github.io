Description :)

Hi Panter and Ilya!
Just showing you what is possible...

After getting 20.05 once and 20.11 three times, finally I had luck...
I missed the first rocket, so I didn't think I'll come close to killing
the spider. But it's done now and I'm happy with it.

Hmmm...
Is it possible without using any rockets?
