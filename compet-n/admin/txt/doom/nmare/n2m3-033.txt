  Description:

Equalled John on the first try, took about 1/2hr to get to this. Not that
hard, it depends on how much damage you take early on really. I'd say 0:30
human optimal, but there's no particular reason this can't be done as fast
as it can be done on UV, which is 0:28 - it _really_ is, trust me.
