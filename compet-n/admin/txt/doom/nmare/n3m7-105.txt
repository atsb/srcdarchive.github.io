  Description:
	
       Implemented Adam Hegyi's jump... a very tough jump for a quite hard level...
       the fast pigs make it very hard to run through.... so for the jump i took care
       .... i used Strafe50 which makes it easier.

       Everything is hard here ... go through those 4 shotgun uys without dying... 
       to slalom between the pigs ...cause they rarely let you enough space...
       and to do that damn jump...

       That's the first time that i do this jump on Nightmare! skill.
       
       PS: Adam, you can beat this easily :) you're the master of E3M7 :))
