  Description :-)

  This is my best try during my ep4-nm runs. As you can see I lost
  lots of health between the red and blue keys, sometimes you don't
  lose at all. On the other hand I didn't lose health coming out
  of the blue key.
  Theoretically even 90% could be possible with lots of trying.
