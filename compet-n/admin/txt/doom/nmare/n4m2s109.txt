Description: Hmmm...I always wondered why this map is only done w/o secret
             exit...should be the same I thought...and tried a bit (:

             As you see this route was EXTREMELY HARD to find out and the
             final .lmp shows this, in an unbelieveable and amazing
             perfectness...hehe...((: (quick note for Adam: that's ironic....
             I didn't plan to fall down 2 times :)

             btw: I want an extra point for this new "out of base" map !¨! (:
