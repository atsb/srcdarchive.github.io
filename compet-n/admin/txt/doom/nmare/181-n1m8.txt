  Description:  This map is another candidate for 200% MMH. I don't have the
                time to go for this task, but you can see from my recording
                in which I take damage in only two occasions (both well
                avoidable), that it is possible to end with 200%.
                The last room, in which you must nearly die to end the
                level is of course exculded - agreed?

      Comment:  Don't expect me to compete any more, I will have simply
                no time to do that in the near future - maybe next year.
               
                If you got new pacifist lmps, mail them to me, do not
                expect me to pick them out of incoming - I did this,
                but I won't be able to do it anymore.
