Description: George Bell mailed me, that he has to complete this level for
             his D1I. So I tried it a little bit in Nightmare!, ...

             This was the text for E2M6-217. But now I've reached the exit.

             It's quite Steffen's way except that I close a door to avoid
             awakening the Baron and some pigs. You need some luck on the
             way back from the yellow key, you must hurry a lot there, or
             the hallway will be filled again and the monsters open some
             doors they should not open. It is quite hard not to have the
             pigs bite at you especially where there are more than two of
             them. Without a chaingun or bonus cell box this level can be
             rather hard.
