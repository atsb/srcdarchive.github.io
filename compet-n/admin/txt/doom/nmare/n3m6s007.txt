  Description :-)

  Yeah, this is my second COMPET-N entry!
  I was looking at Ultimate DooM best times and I realized that E3M6 UV 0:07
  (by Thomas Zajic aka ZlatkO ThE GoDFatheR) was way beyond E3M6 NM 0:14, and I
  thought, wow let's do that 0:07 on NM too...
  It took 30 min to record this one. LMPC says I hit the switch at 7.54 secs,
  which is quite good (Thomas's UV time is 7:74). I think this time can be only
  beaten by a strafe50 driver. Hope no one really wants to beat it... :-)
