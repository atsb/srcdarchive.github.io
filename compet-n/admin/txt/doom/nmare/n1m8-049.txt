  Description :-)

  Still improvable.
  
  I find the following funny, btw:
  (d1i-jrh.txt)
  
  "E1M8 Swarming Pinkies and Invisible Pinkies render this an impossibility.
  Also, you must have both Barons dead at the same time to lower the walls.  
  Not easy with chaingun/shotgun, especially with Invisibles chomping and 
  respawning."
