  Description :-)

  Well, this completes my E2M8-NM* series ... this level isn't that
  hard at all even on NightMare!  - I wouldn't be able to finish it
  if it was ... ;-) The time was measured with a stop watch  (which
  I bought especially for my E1M3 ManiA :-), it goes from the first
  movement till the moment the screen freezes after  good ol' Cybie
  hit the ground.

  I *did* include a .BAT with this, 'coz  S.;-)  takes good care of
  all the newbies out there. :-)  However, I'm convinced that every
  serious LMP'er (like Anthe and me) has a highly-sophisticated one
  of his own to handle this stuff - right? ;-)
