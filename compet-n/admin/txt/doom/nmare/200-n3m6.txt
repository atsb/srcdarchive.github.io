  Description:  It's weird, I had so much trouble in doing the 181-n1m8
                while other maps just wait for someone who does them on
                200%. This is dead simple, and I don't think the route
                is hard to find either. It's just that someone has to do it.
                Btw: Of course you can take the secret exit as well, this
                doesn't change anything, but I think two recordings
                (200-n3m6 and 200-r3m6) are (more than) enough for the same
                route, so I won't make four out of it by playing it to the
                secret exit too.

      Comment:  Gnaahhh, it's not so easy to stop ....
