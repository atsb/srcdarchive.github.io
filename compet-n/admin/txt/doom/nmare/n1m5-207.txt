Description: This comes almost 18 months after Anders' n1m5-215, and I
             guess he is right in saying that this map can be completed
             on nm in under 2 minutes. Notice how I just miss the lift to
             the invisibility and have to call it back down again - this
             probably cost about 5 seconds. It might even be possible to
             skip the soul sphere and save another 5 seconds or so.

             I first completed this map on nightmare just over three years
             ago and I've had a knack for it ever since.
