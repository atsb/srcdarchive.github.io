  Description :-)

  Hi there. Anthe strikes back again. An earlier thought undoable
  map again, and yes I had lots of fun trying this. Compared to
  U4M1 (maybe someday to follow) this is not that hard, but still
  a bitch because of the start, however I spent some time for a
  nice analysis of this start and I think it went perfect in this
  .LMP, the "Winterfeldt Jump" is the next (more psychological)
  hurdle to take. Also I had to realize that I must kill most of
  the cacos because of the later jump to the "cybie-teleport". At
  the end I was fairly lucky (also nervous ;-) to survive, but,
  yaah, I did it !

  So, one question remains: is an EP4-NM.LMP possible ?
