C-N entry #60.

I think that I'm the first to use the DDQ route in a nightmare run, which
also brings this run closer to the UV record.  The entire run from the
beginning to the red key is quite easy with practice, but the end scene
is a huge leap of faith.  It's quite entertaining. :)

Still, I am disappointed with the way the rest of the demo looks.. I know
I could have run this much better, but unfortunately, I tried for several
hours (and several days) after getting this demo and never succeeded. So,
good luck to anyone who tries this one.  Time to get back to practicing for
30nm..
