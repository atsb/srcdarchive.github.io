  Description :-)

  Three days ago I hadn't played this level at all except for a saved
  game 5 months ago. Now I have done it in NM! and regular... I have a
  faster one but Yonatan thinks it has too much wallpunishing in it ;-)

  BTW, watch our "superb" Final doom collection where we make "chumas"
  out of "The Casali Bros" creation! It can be downloaded from:

  ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/doom/doom/themes/TeamTNT/fduvdemo.zip

  But since you're all very clever you will of course use a mirrorsite!
