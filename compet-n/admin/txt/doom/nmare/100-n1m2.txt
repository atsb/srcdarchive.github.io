  Description :-)

  The only tricky part is to get to the SuperCharge without getting
  hit - which is not always as easy as it sounds.  Lots of Soldiers
  and Shotgunners can make that a real challenge. The pistol, which
  seems to be aiming off-centre at times, doesn't help either.  :-/

  [ .BAT stuff snipped for briefness - it was getting old anyway! ]
