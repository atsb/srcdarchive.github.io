Ok, this is certainly one of the ugliest maps I have
seen from Ultimate Doom, but this route is not that hard. 
Just hold to the right and you will not trigger the
Barons. I got 4 lmps ending in 38 seconds and I am sure
it is possible to get at least 36 seconds (skip shooting
the last imp) and even maybe 35 seconds with lots of luck..
