Description: Took me about two hours, the end dosn't look good at all.
             I'm not doing this as to optimize, I'm practising for episode
             4 NM-run. If anoyone have any sugestions or tips which could be 
             helpfull, I'd be more than glad to hear from them.
             Hmmm...next: N4M7...
             Oh, and: This GREAT route I use here is Rini's TM :-) Although I
             prefer BFG for the end-sequence...
