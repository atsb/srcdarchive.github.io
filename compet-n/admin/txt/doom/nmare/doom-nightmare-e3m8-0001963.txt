===================================
Description: I have to say, Adam really struck quite a gold run on this map. And then Kimo Xvirus came in with 18.97
in time and that was perhaps the most luckiest RNG run for a boss map in Doom. Maybe some day someone will get 29
seconds on E2M8 but well that would be assuming someone has the luck and patience to try that. I gotten 20-22
seconds dozens of time until suddenly now I am at around 19 seconds. Well assuming anybody wants to beat this in the
miliseconds, well go ahead. Though if you really want to go further, try below 19 seconds, now that is really just
pushing your luck.
