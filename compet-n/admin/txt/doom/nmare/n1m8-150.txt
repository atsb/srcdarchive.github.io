  Description:  Last movement at 1:50, switch pressed at 1:38.
                I tried to compare the time at which the switch is
                pressed with the privious fastest by Davorin Mestric,
                but that's impossible, he played with UT all the time.
                Very strange.
                This was too easy (and it will be very easy to beat as well)
                I guess that nobody has played it for speed so far.

                Hmm, wasn't there someone who said, that the quality of
                entries in the -fast and -respawn category cannot be
                compared with speed, max and nm?

                In the case of DooM-max and DooM-nm it can!
