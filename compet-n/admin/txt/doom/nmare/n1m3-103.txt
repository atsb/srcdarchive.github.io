	      This map used to be alot of fun on NM...but now it have become
              far too luckbased.	I'm sure you can play until next year w/o
              even reaching the #%@œ&% exit once, or you can have more luck 
              then I'll ever have and do it in first try. Screw it...!

I thought the map became more fun the more I played, but I do agree that luck does
play a good role in this one.  The demons are proving to be quite annoying in
NM.
