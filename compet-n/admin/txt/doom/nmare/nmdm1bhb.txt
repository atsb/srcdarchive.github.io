  Descriptions

  Wow... this shows what I do with my free time. Here's a description
  of each level.  Thanx to ALL those .LMP makers out there who's
  techniques I mimicked or worked on.  A huge thanks to Steffen and
  Anthe, who's skills and movies drove me back to single player.
  This took about one week during my free time to finish.

  N1M1 - I hope there isn't a soul on earth who can't do this... the
         Ultimate DooM route is easiest, but I chose the faster route
         which can easily kill you, took me 7 tries to get 12 seconds.
         I didn't want to waste too much time with this one.
  N1M2 - Not too rough.  No critical parts.
  N1M3 - Thanx id for making such a beast of a level!  But isn't it
         amazing how so many levels are possible?  I exit to the
         secret level.  I planned this route myself.  Though I mess up
         in getting the rocket launcher secret twice!
  N1M4 - Very simple if you know the path to take... I missed the key
         like a fool :)
  N1M5 - Another near impossible map.  I didn't want to do this one
         again so I copied my D1I DHT exam for it.  Very watchable and
         cool, like N1M3.  I get near death twice (below 10%), my
         route also.  I saw two other recordings of this from scratch
         recently.  One of Anthe (good job!) and a keyboarder (agh!).
         Well done!  I would never expect a keyboarder to do such a
         difficult level on NightMare!  But maybe my route needs some
         work ;)  Damn dances :)  I fall apart totally when I entered
         the third building :(
  N1M6 - Simple.  The *only* hard part is the end. I didn't feel like
         re-recording so I copied my DHT lmp.  This one was done way
         back with my crappy old mouse.
  N1M7 - This one sucks!  Too many enemies, too many barrels (of fun),
         not enough chaingun ammo.  A decent amount of health.  It's
         run or be killed (what fun... just like N1M3 and N1M5, but
         somewhat simpler).  This one took me a great many tries and
         the fact that you can get shot from everywhere doesn't help.
         Plus, the respawn time sucked for me.
  N1M8 - The beginning's all luck with how many demons die and the end
         you wanna ignore the Partial Invis, otherwise relatively easy
         although I got the Invisibility and I get nailed repeatedly
         by my good friend, the Baron.  A very poor lmp file, but the
         level was boring.
  N1M9 - I didn't have enough time to complete this one :P

  N2M1 - A pretty hard map considering it's the first level.  Just aim
         well and you should do OK.  And make sure to get the shotgun
         first and plasma right afterward.  Can be hard if you don't
         keep calm and play well.
  N2M2 - I didn't have a plan going into this map.  I just tried to
         remember Steffen's D1S which is why I got the (useless)
         yellow key.  I even start to get crushed... heh.  Too
         annoying to get the weapons and I didn't need 'em so it's
         better to take the quick way out.
  N2M3 - Simple level.  Strafe run at the beginning, grab the shotgun.
         Get the plasma and key, and plasma your way to the health and
         end.  2nd try.  I've done this one MUCH better.  But check
         out the health I've got at the end.  If not for the Mega-
         Armor I'd have been dead!
  N2M4 - I start out great and get wrecked by some sergeants.  Don't
         ask why I got the Supercharge at the end.  Fairly easy if you
         know the route.  And if the Caco waits for you at the last
         step... use Shotgun or he can take you out, plasma sux around
         corners.
  N2M5 - The hardest part is getting the shotgun at the beginning.
         Otherwise, it's just a run to make it to the end.  Took me 3
         tries I think.
  N2M6 - I didn't have enough time to complete this one either :(
  N2M7 - An all around pretty cool map.  The look and play is fun.
         Too bad I don't get to visit it all.  Getting the shotgun
         isn't really hard either.  The only part to worry about is
         with the demons during Invulnerability; if you can't get out
         in time, you can get screwed.
  N2M8 - I'm not re-recording this because it's just a boring level.
         Yeah I get hit; no, I don't care :)  I got some pretty cool
         moving shots against the souls though.
  N2M9 - I almost forgot it was on Nightmare!  Dodge and get them to
         fight, then run for it... I half expected everyone to respawn
         and I messed up the final room sorta (not knowing what to
         flip).

  N3M1 - Getting past the initial cacos *can* be hard but really isn't
         if you use the imps.  Getting the shotgun safely is also
         annoying.  The rest shouldn't be too hard for a seasoned
         DooMer.
  N3M2 - Simple.  Just a run for plasma, a grab of a key, about 80
         shots, a flip of a switch and you're out!
  N3M3 - In all honesty, this must be the hardest start of any
         possible NightMare level in DooM (from scratch anyway).  I
         found out that if I turn right after the init refresh daemon
         is done, and start to strafe left and run forward, I'd get
         past the demon.  I can't read what the AI will do next so I
         kept dying and I also tried to get the rocket launcher a
         couple of times, and almost made it once (except I killed
         myself like a moron.  After I got the shotgun I forgot the
         route! As you will see.
  N3M4 - 3rd try.  I had bad luck with rockets the first two times :P
         After the start the rest is damn easy.  Not that the
         beginning is hard either.  I even totally miss the two
         switches and I still exit.
  N3M5 - The only thing standing between you and the exit is a simple
         route, *slight* luck with Demon AI, and how far you get with
         the Invul.
  N3M6 - Damn.  They can't get much easier can they?  3 unbelievably
         simple routes to this.  I include two.  One without any
         killing, and one that's interesting (secret then normal exit).
         The other way is to get into the secret exit with the rocket
         launcher.  1st one's a D1I.
  N3M7 - Completed on my first nightmare run!  Sadly... I missed the
         strafe run jump about a million times at the end.  A simple
         level, except maybe the beginning sergeants which can kill
         you quickly, but don't give ME a hard time.
  N3M8 - Get the SpiderMastermind to fight the others and you have a
         big ugly, shiney, wall guarding you, not to mention you can
         destroy that wall and beat the game! :D
  N3M9 - My D1I Free... I did it my first try.  Cut it close at the
         end, but I achieved my first try goal.

  N4M1 - I can't do this one...  I suggest getting the Shotgun
         immediately followed by rockets to telefrag 2 sergeants.  No
         health is total BS on id's part (6% doesn't count).  Go ahead
         Steffen, Anthe, Daniel... try this one!
  N4M2 - Another impossible Nightmare level brought to you by the
         psychos at id.  Tried this one a billion times.  I somehow
         got the key blue key once.  PURE LUCK on my part.  Any takers
         on this one?
  N4M3 - The start's a bitch.  You nail that, most of the rest is easy,
         except for a hard jump that I never thought possible until I
         saw Mike Pratt's D1I.  I kinda mess up but it won't seem very
         noticeable to the watcher.  Another D1I.
  N4M4 - The start's luck.  Took me 10 tries.  Not too difficult if
         you know the secrets.  I took the wrong teleporter.  I wanted
         the rockets and chaingun.  Oh well.  Still a pretty good run.
  N4M5 - ???
  N4M6 - ???
  N4M7 - The beginning's hard.  But if you get to the Cyber room, the
         rest is a snap.  This was going to be my out of base D1I if
         someone uploaded E4M3 as their out of base.  No one did so I
         was stuck with this; hence, the dance.  There's also a second
         route included without the invulnerability and it's probably
         about 10 times as difficult.
  N4M8 - Pretty damn hard.  If id didn't include all the weapons and
         health... it would probably be impossible.  It requires a lot
         of skill, luck, ammo, and the Partial Invisibility.  Without
         it, the sergeants and troops make quick work of you.  This
         one for me was pretty damn hard.  Took me about 20 tries.
  N4M9 - I saw this on a D1I and the jump is really hard.  An easy map
         if you have patience.  But the jumps at the beginning were
         luck for me.


  Hey id, great job on Quake.  It's not perfect but it grows on you.  But
  rest assured DooM will never die!  It's a near perfect product.  My only
  complaint with it is that there isn't a third installment. (I want the
  HeXeN engine! :)

  I did this set of .LMP's to get myself to stop playing DooM and DooM II
  on single player.  It worked!  I'll be quitting for about a month or two.
  And if anyone who has good skill with a mouse thinks that Anthe, Daniel
  and Steffen are "DooM gods"... well... they're right.  But these .LMP's
  show that, with dedication, anyone has a decent chance.
