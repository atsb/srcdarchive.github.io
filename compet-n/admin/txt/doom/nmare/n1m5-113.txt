        Don't do that, it'll get chopped off =). How does this strike you,
        then?
        I think the phrase for the exit room is "HA HA HA HA HA i'm a lucky
        little fucker". Hehehe :). Under 1:10 is possible here, if you don't
        bother clearing the imp corridors. Credit to Chris for some route
        help here, especially the neat first few seconds and showing that
        the UV method is possible at the door to circle room.
