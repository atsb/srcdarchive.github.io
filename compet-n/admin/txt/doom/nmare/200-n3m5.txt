                This made me curious. I watched Eelco's e3m5-520
                (Hi, Eelco very nice to have the first COMPET-N player back
                in buiseness) and suddenly reckogniced this route.
              
                ... and what a NICE route that is:
                - no danger of taking damage
                - a supercharge and
                - a plasma rifle for free!

      Comment:  Don't expect me to compete any more, I will have simply
                no time to do that in the near future - maybe next year.
