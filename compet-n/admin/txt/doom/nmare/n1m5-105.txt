Description:

             bother clearing the imp corridors. Credit to Chris for some route
             help here, especially the neat first few seconds and showing that
             the UV method is possible at the door to circle room.

The end of Adam's run is pretty funny, so I included the demo in this zip.
I recommend watching it before watching this one.  The monsters tie me up
a bit at the end because I wasn't brave enough to try and recreate the
effect. :)
