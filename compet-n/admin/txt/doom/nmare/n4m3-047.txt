Description :-)

I guess that's the first lmp by me in quite some time, the reason is that I
played much Quake recently... but Doom is still the greatest. Quite an easy
map on Nightmare, if you take it calmly. Since I wanted the partial
invisibility I took the berserk as well, so I didn't mind getting hit in the
beginning, but I had a try when I reached the invulnerability with 100%
health!

Thanks go to Peo for not minding this at all, and for the previous lmp, and
of course for forcing me by threats to send this lmp :)
