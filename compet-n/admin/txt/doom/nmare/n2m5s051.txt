  Description :)

  After doing my f2m5 I thought that this would be easy, but
  it's really much much harder without that invisibility.  I
  consider my time quite good.  I have a couple of attempts
  where I die at the door in the souls room.  Both of those
  ended around 51/52, so they would have been around 55 maybe.
  With some more TGM skills it could be around 45-50.  This is
  the first time I beat an Adam Hegyi record, so I'm quite proud
  of it.
