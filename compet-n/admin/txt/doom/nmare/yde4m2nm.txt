  I didn't know what to name this, as there's already an E4M2-NM by Anthe,
  so I did it like UGE1M9NM, if it needs renaming, no problem...

  This is hard, but it took me about 40 minutes less than E1M3-NM... I
  believe this route is better than Anthe's, so the lmp isn't as good, it
  took me 3 whole tries to get to the bfg!! Still, I made it, the first
  real thing I do in Nightmare...

  I believe this level is possible with -Fast and 100/100, but very hard...
  and needs a good route.
