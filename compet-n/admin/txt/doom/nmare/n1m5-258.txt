Comments: I watched Anthe's n1m5-314 and saw there were a couple of nasty
          areas which he took quite slowly. So I decided to try and beat
          it. I used the shotgun on the monsters near the yellow door so I
          could save rockets for later. I was lucky to get from the soul
          sphere to the lift without taking much damage.
