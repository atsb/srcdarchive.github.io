  Description :-)

  Well, now I've got it - and this .LMP is really watchable.
  For myself, it's really fun to see all the mistakes I made.

  I played "over cool" for the first two maps, then got my
  normal stress level in E1M3 and increased it enormously
  after some bad luck with a barrel. This kept me confused
  till the very end of E1M4. You'll see two situations, where
  I was totally lost and had   B I G   luck. But however, I
  have many much better recordings, where I finish in E1M7.

  From E1M5 on (the start is very carefull, although this is
  my second favourite map of this .LMP) I played rather well
  I think and I got back onto the planned route of health and
  armour. The end of E1M7 was a little close, but who cares ?

  [ Dear Mr. Admin: I added some seconds right after E1M7, so
    please if this is not enough, do not disqualify me, as I
    can also add some more ;-) ]

[  Admin. Note :-) Andreas already knew that I would NOT DQ an entry
   as good as this... ALL of Episode One on NightMare! Because of...

   Admin. Note :-( Steffen doesn't wait for very long at each of the
   "tally" screens - Just long enough to hit "F1" for a screen dump,
   matching the pace of the near "NightMare-ish" action, perhaps ;-)

   ( A candidate for Disqualification. Nah... It's just TOO GOOD :-)


   He also asked why there were "only" four COMPET-N points (waiting
   for him) for this because Steffen's .LMP would NOT -PlayDemo with
   Regular DooM Version 1.9 [ as I had requested... AND also because
   that .LMP was NOT submitted for this COMPET-N... ]

   He is absolutely correct in asking - EIGHT points awarded !!! :-)
