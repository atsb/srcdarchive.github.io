Description:

  Yes, well this was quite difficult Adam, but as they
  say in Hunga-...hey wait, I'm not Adam H!  What the
  hell's going on here?

  Hehe, not to be taken seriously.  Anyway, this was a
  bit tricky, but nothing you couldn't have done Adam W.
  0:29 on the other hand, probably really is a task for
  Adam H.
