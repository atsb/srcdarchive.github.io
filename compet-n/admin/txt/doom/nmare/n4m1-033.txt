I knew I would beat Vile with this route but
I didn't expect to beat him by 2 seconds.

The start technique consists of simply backing
off after having woken up the sergeants who
will start some infights and then shooting
at the right platform to kill the remaining
ones when going for the elevator. After that,
I use the same route expect for the blue key
room where I prefer to use the RL which is
faster, i guess.

The ending is always really tense, because
you never know how many monsters will be in
your way, and if you miss the last SG shot on
that annoying sergeant you just about screw
the whole run.

I had a far better looking demo which was
recorded on prboom. I started using 1.9 after
I got it and didn't how to turn vert sens off.
Now it's done but it sucked big time to play
with it.
