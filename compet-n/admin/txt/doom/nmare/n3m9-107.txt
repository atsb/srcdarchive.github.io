  Description :-)

As Adam says, it all depends on the start...0:33 is extremely hard here, and
there was a lot of slack in Adam's time, so I just played a bit safer in the
imp room than you need to on NM - to get 0:33 (or 0:32, which is certainly
on) you have to fire 4 shots then walk in, I took a couple more this time.
