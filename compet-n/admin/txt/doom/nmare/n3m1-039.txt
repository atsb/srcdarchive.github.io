Description: Ok...I watched Adam's ep3nm-run and thought, Hey..lets try this..
             I got this 0:39 and DID NOT KNOW that it beats the previous
             .recording (mine :)

             Here are both .lmps... n3m1try.lmp is the original .lmp, and
             n3m1-039 IS CUTTED ! (I just deleted the lines after n3m1)

             IMO it is allowed to use only the first level(s) from a movie.
             How do you think about that..?

             btw: Don't laugh...I die very silly...but it's my 2nd try and I'm
             7secs faster than e3nm (:
