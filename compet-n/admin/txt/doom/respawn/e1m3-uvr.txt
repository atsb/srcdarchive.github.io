  Introduction...

  This is an Example for a New Category of UV -Respawn .LMP's...

  Requirements: 100% (or more) Kills and Secrets OR M.M. Health.


  Description :-)

  Just an initial effort...

  I've not been able to complete this one on NightMare - or even
  "-Skill 4 -Respawn" - which only(?) goes to show that it's the
  respawn that is the killer... E1M3-GM is a *lot* more easy ;-)

  This is one that _Anthe_Kren_ sent me during his D1I NightMare
  training - way back... Maybe I should ask for his permission.
