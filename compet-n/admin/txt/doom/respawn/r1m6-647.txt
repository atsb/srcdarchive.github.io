  Introduction...

  This is an Example for a New Category of UV -Respawn .LMP's...

  Requirements: 100% (or more) Kills and Secrets OR M.M. Health.


  Description :-)

  Just an initial effort...

  Another rough one... Difficult to get a good balance between
  kills, health and speed... and get THE secret ;-)

  A good level for NightMare training - Not as "impossible" as
  E1M3-NM or E1M5-NM but *lots* harder than E2M3-NM or E3M2-NM
  which IM(NS)HO should *not* be rated as D1I "hard".

  Anyway, my very own s-l-o-w E1M6-NM.LMP available - Want ?!?
