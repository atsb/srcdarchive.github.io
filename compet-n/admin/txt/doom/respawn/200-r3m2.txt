Description:  never hit + soulsphere = perfect! :-)

              puh, now that was really tough as hell. i think i've
              played this map at least 50 times to make in without
              any hit(s), trying various route- and kill-scenarios.

              the main problem is, that you can't just make a run
              to the exit, because you have to get the megasphere for
              maximum health. and for that part, you need (more) ammo.
              and to get it, you have to disturb a few more monsters.
              monsters that follow you. and you mustn't kill them,
              since you have a shortage of ammo and (at least the
              cacos) respawn anyway.

              this is now the optimised route, and i think it's a
              fairly save one (only 1 lost soul and the respawned
              1st shotgunner in your back).
