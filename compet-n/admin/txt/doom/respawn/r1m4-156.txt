  Description :  Just made this in the course of trying to do all of episode
  1 on all styles for Public DANG (Public Demo Archives of the Non Gods -
  a good place to send all those compet-n entries that got beaten :>). I
  made a quickie 2:24 then realised I was close to the record, so knocked
  this out. It's not even faster than the non respawn record, so I fully
  expect it to be beaten by tomorrow, but what the hell :).
