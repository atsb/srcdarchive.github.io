  Description:  Your turn Donatas ;-)
                I guess I could reach something like 2:50 here, but my
                motivation in squeezing seconds is not too high.
                I prefer to play new things, where one has to figure out
                new routes. This safety thing (eg. 200-r1m4, 200-n2m2)
                still leaves lots of space to dicover new routes.
