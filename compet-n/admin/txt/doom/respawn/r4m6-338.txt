  Description:  This is not me beating myself, it's just the answer to Esko
                who recorded r4m6 in 6:10. My 7:08 recording wasn't ment to
                be fast, just safe. This route is what I suggest for speeding.
                I neither take the rockets, nor open the yellow door.
                One has to be careful not to score less than 100% kills on
                that route.
