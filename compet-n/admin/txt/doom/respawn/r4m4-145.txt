Description: Interesting stuff (:
             Yesterday night I downloaded the latest r4m4 news...and
             surprisingly I chosed to watch the fastest one today...(don't
             even think about it normally)

             Yes..I don't want to write "took only balbla"...but this came
             incredible fast...even faster than most speed or nm's. (:

             My first try was in the 1:3x's...but the problem is to get
             100% kills here IMO...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
             Yes...this was my .txt after 2 1:51...
             but then to friends came over here and I stopped this for some
             hours...
             Still looks improveable..
