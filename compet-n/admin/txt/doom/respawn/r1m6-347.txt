  DooM - Ep.1 Mi.6

  Kills    101%
  Secret   100%  and Time  03:47

  Description :  _Technically_, this could be done around 3:30ish - i've got
  a 3:30 98/100 - but it's a catch-22, as you have to stick around longer
  to get more monsters to respawn :). Very frustrating getting fast 98%
  runs...
