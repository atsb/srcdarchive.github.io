  Description:  It always has been annoying to end with less than 100% kills
                in max and respawn. The exit jump introduces the opportunity
                for an even more annying end.
                This would definitely be more fun w/o the jump.
                I don't blame Daniel, I blame iD.

         Note:  Only 50% are reachable.

           PS:  Anybody going for tyson here?
