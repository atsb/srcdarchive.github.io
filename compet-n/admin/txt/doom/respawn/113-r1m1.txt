  Description:  never hit + all potions = perfect! :-)

                i think the rule for maximum minimum health is/was
                a little bit unclear. i think that if at any point
                of a recording a damage is taken, the maximum minimum
                health claim cannot be higher as to the moment after
                the damage was subtacted.

                best way would have been to count the cumulated
                damage taken, but that would consume alot of time,
                especially in bigger maps with multiple hits, e.g.
                map 29 of doom2... :-)
