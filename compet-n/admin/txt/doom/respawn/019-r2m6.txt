     Description:

     I think this map is particular well designed, because it pays to get
     every secret and to visit every room. Each of them contains at least
     one goodie. I'm sure that someone will proove me wrong and make this
     with something like 80% just blazing through this level ...

     This recording is my free interpretation for my DHT6 D1M exam and wasn't
     really played for neither speed nor safty, but I think it's ok as an
     initial efford.
