  Description :

  To get the soul-sphere you've got to pass the lava. That costs up to 10%
  as S. ;-) showed in his 090-r1m4. It's no problem to do it with just 5%
  loss and to score 95%. On addition there are some health boni one can take 
  before passing the lava. Going to the mega-armor looks too dangerous to me, 
  so I take the health boni at the blue key card. That's much easier if one 
  has a shotgun - costs some time to get one, but SAFETY is the goal. 
  With a health of 105% I'm prepared for the lava run and end it with 100%.
  That's the first damage I take and I think therefore the score has to 
  be 100%.
  (of course health doesn't drop below 100% after getting the soul-sphere :-)

  If someone is able to pass the lava without any loss, he will propably 
  score something like 190% ...
