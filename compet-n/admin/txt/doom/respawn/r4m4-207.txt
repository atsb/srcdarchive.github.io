                Don't worry about it, I even want to thank you for this!
                If you hadn't made this demo, I wouldn't have tried this hard to
                improve my time. It cost me two hours to beat your time.

                Yeah, there sure is about 20 seconds to cut off, but it has to be
                a Doomgod like Anders Johnsen to do this.
