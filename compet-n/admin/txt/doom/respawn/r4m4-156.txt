Description:  This day started very bad, finding out that
              Donatas had broken my record within 12 hours.
              And I knew that I had only 1,5 hours to record,
              between work and going out tonight.
              Just before wanting to quit for today, I had this fantastic
              recording, under 2 minutes and with exactly 100% kills.

              I just can't wait to see what Donatas has done when I come 
              back home tonight. Hopefully I don't need another session like
              this tomorrow...
