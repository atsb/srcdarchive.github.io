  Description :-)

  Piece of pie, except getting in & out of the red key room without
  having to pick Imp claws & Spectre teeth off your armor later on.
  Unlike "Just Fast", a shotgun is highly recommended  ...  Berserk
  only is just not the ideal way to avoid taking damage.  Duh!  ;-)

  [ .BAT stuff snipped for briefness - it was getting old anyway! ]
