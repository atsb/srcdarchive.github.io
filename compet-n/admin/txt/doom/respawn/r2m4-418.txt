  Description:  This is my first try with 100% secrets and >= 100% kills.
                And, ha ha, I've got EXACTELY 100% kills, pfuhh.
                Beeing so lucky tells me not to try it again.
                I should have read Peo's e2m4-528.txt:
             
                > I had problems with the last secret though.
                > Seem like the bridge to the soulsphere did
                > not rise far enough in most tries!

                I had some tries at 90% too, and didn't know why. I thought
                that maybe it's because I entered the chaingun secret in
                a hurry, w/o shooting the wall open. Really,
                I should have read it before - arghh.

                PS:
                I've forgotten the following credits so many times:

      Credits:  To Yonatan for making the secret finder (scrtfind) and
                to the DEU crew for the nice feature Jump_to_sector.
