  Description:

  I bet you weren't expecting this, were you? ;)
  
  Early this year, I discovered I was just two videos away from the 200 videos
  on my YouTube channel, so I decided that for my 200th video, I'd try to get
  another record in the Compet-n -- on an IWAD!  And not just the Final Doom
  IWADs, either; I would go for one on none other than The Ultimate Doom!  So
  here I am, with a demo that beats a UV -respawn record from 2000.  How about
  that?
  
  Alas, it's an ugly-looking demo; there are several errors here and there.
  Watch me attack the wall with a rocket, trying to kill monsters on an elevator
  who turn out not to be there at all!  Watch me run against a raised floor at
  the end trying to get on it rather than backing up first!  And so on.
  This, however, was the fastest demo I was able to pull off today.  Oh, well!
  
  Still, I was able to beat Radek Pecka's 11-year-old record by six seconds,
  /and/ I made a demo three seconds faster than Xit Vono's UV max demo,
  fulfilling my maxim that a UV -respawn demo should always be faster than a max
  one.  I utilized strategies from that max demo while practicing for this one,
  and hopefully, it's paid off.  Enjoy!
