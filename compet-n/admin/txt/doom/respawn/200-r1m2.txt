  Description :-)

  Easy to get it done without getting below 100 % Health, just need
  to be a bit careful on your way to the SuperCharge. But - to make
  this at least a bit of a challenge I tried not to get hit at all!
  It worked ... and yes, it took me "some" tries. ;-)

  [ .BAT stuff snipped for briefness - it was getting old anyway! ]
