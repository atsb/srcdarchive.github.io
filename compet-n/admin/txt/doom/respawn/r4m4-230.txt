Description:    Before today I never had a clue how to get 100%
                kills in a respawn demo. But this morning, I knew it:
                just count every monster you shoot and go to the exit
                when you have shot enough of them. 
                
                I want to say thanks to my friend Ralf Schreivogel,
                who showed me the empty places in the Compet-n list
                and also to Anders Johnson for not trying r4m4 yet.
