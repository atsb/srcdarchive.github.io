  Description :)
  Yay! Another IWAD demo!
  Under 2:00 is possibly but would require perfect play plus a lot of luck;
  this took me long anough so I'll leave that to someone else.
  Surprised Radek didn't snatch this from Arno Slagboom, but then again,
  2005 was at the end of his career...
    
     
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 2:11 by Arno Slagboom, timestamped:
