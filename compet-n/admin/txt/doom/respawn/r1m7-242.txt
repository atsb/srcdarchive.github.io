Description:	This is what Compet-n is all about, raising each other's
                level of playing!

                I'm sure you will come up with a demo under 2:40, Jan Endre
                and it's just a matter of time before one of us reaches the
                2:30 goal. Maybe Anders isn't even needed for that...  :)
