Description:  After visiting the Incoming this morning,
              I felt very bad. All my respawn records had 
              been broken by Jan-Endre with amazing times.

              R1m2-205 seemed easily improvable though
              and after few tries I got this 2:04.

              Still this isn't the optimal time and I think
              even below 2 minutes is possible...
