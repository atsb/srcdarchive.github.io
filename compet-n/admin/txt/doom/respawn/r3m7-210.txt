Description:	I belive this is one of the uygliest maps in Ultimate Doom.
		Bad structur, textures.................!

		Oh well. I didn't know if I would bader making this LMP, but I
		saw many mistakes in Rini's LMP, so I decided to go for it. I'm
		not todaly saticfide whith this recording. I did beat Rini with
		11 seconds, but there are still many things that can be done
		better. F.eks. all the hanging in the monsters, the second blue
		door is "slow" to open................

		This is not an hard map. The hardest thing I belive, is the
		jump with the yellow door (it's not to hard when you have found
		a way).
