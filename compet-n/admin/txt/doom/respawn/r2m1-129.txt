Description:	YES......:) Finaly I did it! This level is veary hard to get 
		under 1:30 with 100% kills, because in this map there are so
		many things that must work for you (this are the same things 
                that must work on UV - also current by me).

		I'm not todaly satisfied with this LMP, there are so many
		things I could have done better. OK...it's under par, but my
		best time was 1:26 (98% kills), and even this could be done
	        faster.
