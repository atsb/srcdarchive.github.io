  Description :

Don't know why the record for this was so slow...Adam's -fast record
was a full four seconds faster than his respawn record :). The time for this
level depends on how many shotgun shells you fire. I count it by how many
are left, assuming you pick up both shell boxes. For a 1:00 run you have
24 or 25 shells left. Kai's amazing :51 record had 31 left, which is why it
was so fast - he fired far fewer shotgun shells than you normally have to
but still killed everything with plasma and rockets afterwards. I went for
about 28 or 29 shells to get a 0:55. It's exactly linked to success rate,
also...if you went for 33 shells, eventually you would probably get it, and
get a faster time than 0:51...it'd just take a huge amount of time. By
contrast, if you go for 20 shells, you'll get a finished run every time,
it'll just take about 1:05 or more :)
