  Description:  After recording it in 2:48 on uv100/100, here it is
                the re100/100 version. I am pracising strafe50 running
                and I do it as often as I can in that recording.
               
                FastStrafe   3.24%   when strafing  7.78%

                Well there's much to improve.
                Btw:
                I do not use any special tricks for strafe50. I just
                press [StrafeRight] + [StrafeOn] + [TurnRight] at the
                same time. Together with the [Move] and the [SpeedOn]
                key this gives you six kay tu press altogether,
                as long as you don't shoot ...

                Btw:
                Most of the time I end either with 97% or with > 110%
                kills. This is the closest I ever reached.
