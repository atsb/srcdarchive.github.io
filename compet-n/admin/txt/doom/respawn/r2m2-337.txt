             Well, I agree with Arno that this could go under 3:30...
             however, it suffers from the classic respawn problem that
             the faster you go, the less monsters respawn. Credits to
             Arno for his route, I used it exactly at the start...however,
             I did introduce a few changes at the end and at the yellow
             key areas of my own.
