  Description: Now that ALL Doom2 maps are done on re100/100 I start
               to collect some more for Doom1.
               This map is quite funny to play that way. Lots of action
               with the rocketlauncher. As you can see in that recording
               it can cause some trouble if the monsters do respawn next
               to you while you are fireing rockets ...

               Only 90% secrets? Oh yes, a design bug in this map makes
               it impossible to score more.
