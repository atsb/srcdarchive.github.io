  Description :-)

  Right, so why the hell did I do an entry for the respawn category? Well,
  I just thought of beating these entries already there. As I found out,
  it's useless (as I thought) and not interesting, I mean, what's the point
  of playing with -Respawn? (Basil Fawlty tone of voice ;-) Nightmare is a
  lot more interesting!

  So I did R1M1 and R1M2 and I had enough. But you can have them...
