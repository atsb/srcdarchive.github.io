  Description:  I wanted to play this for quite a while, but I did not
                like to take Simon's last compet-n (half) point.
                It's hard to calculate the kill ratio in this map.
                Obviously Panter showed us not his usual skill in that
                r1m7-408 - this has been VERY easy to beat.

      Credits:  To Yonatan for making the secret finder (scrtfind) and
                to the DEU crew for the nice feature Jump_to_sector.
