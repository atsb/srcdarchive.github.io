===================================
Description:

This is one of those rare situations where the -respawn timer is impossible
to have lower than the UV Max time due to the setup. The ending on UV Max
is unimportant to the route and category due to the death floor ending.
HOWEVER, this is ENTIRELY DIFFERENT doing this on UV -respawn. It becomes a
balancing act. Not to mention that it has the most unique route through the
map when given respawning monsters and the requirement for such a run.

The major difference between Max/-fast and -respawn is that you NEED to be
able to reach 100% kills minimum, since it IS possible on ANY map when you
tack on the -respawn parameter. So the question then becomes, "What is the
quickest way to get 100% kills on this map?" What results is this .lmp file.

Starting it out is the same as all categories: blow up the barrel, clear out
the start, grab weapons, take elevator. From here, it changes. You want to
constantly kill any Specters that spawn while balancing damage on the Barons.
If there are no Specters, then you will want to go back down the lift (which
is not seen or needed in any other category) and take out a few of the pink
Demons again. Don't overdo it because you still have to be concerned about
getting a speedy exit. After going down there, if it's needed, come back up
the lift and finish the Barons off.

Yes, the jump trick is still needed to get to the last room faster. Here's
where the biggest difference in the Max/-fast and -respawn runs is located.
All those enemies in the exit? They become legitimate targets to add to your
percentage of reaching 100% kills. For once, the Invisibility is USEFUL.
Picking it up keeps the shotgunners from laying waste to you quickly,
giving you a good opportunity to take them out along with some Imps before
you die. Don't waste time on the Demons as you'll use more ammo for less
efficiency. Getting to the last room though means you need to be within 4
kills or less of having 100%.

It's a rather unique, tricky little balancing act when it all comes down to
it. While it doesn't seem like there's a lot that needs to go on, in
actuality you have a lot going on at the same time. You have to pay a lot
of attention to your surroundings, to the Baron's health, to the Specter
respawning locations, to the ammo, and to your own location when the Barons
finally die. It's fun, but this one actually took me a bit of time to come
up with an effective strategy to get.

Thanks go to Zvonimir "fx02" Buzanic for allowing this .lmp as an entry. Back
in the old days with Adam Hegyi running Compet-N, E1M8 never had a category
for UV -respawn because of the incredible hassle and difficulty of figuring
out if you had 100% kills or not, especially when coupled with the fact that
there is no time seen upon exit in plain vanilla Doom.exe. Fortunately with
the coding of source ports, you can simply run the .lmp recorded in Doom.exe
through a source port like PRBoom+ to see if you have hit 100% kills or not.
You even get to see your time in doing this. The only downside is that you
still have to watch back every single successful attempt, but hey, it's a
start ;)
