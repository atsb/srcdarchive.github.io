  Description :-)

When my friend Thomas showed me his first entries for this new category
I shortly thought and then decided to try the only two maps I really
know good enough to make it within a short time. Well and it happened :-)
After a short time of recording I realized that the best time for this
category should be at least equal if not much better than the corresponding
100/100 entry. 100/100 is here also what you have to do :-) and I did it
absolutely perfect, avoided all unnecessary spectre and demon kills and
finally got under 3 mins ... so I am very pleased with the time ...
