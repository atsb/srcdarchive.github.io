  Description :-)

  If you want to know why I did this and why I stopped, read R1M1-043.TXT
  Anyway I just went through the maze without having any idea where I am,
  killed some monsters twice and therefore got 110% kills. If I look like I
  don't know what I'm doing, don't worry, I don't know what I'm doing ;-)

  What *could* be fun with -Respawn is getting something like 1000% kills,
  of course it would be boring too, but whatever.

  Ok, [Prostetnic Vogon] Peo, take whatever you want from here, I'm done
  here! ;-)
