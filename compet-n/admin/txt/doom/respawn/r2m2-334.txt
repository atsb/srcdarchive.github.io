Description: 

Hmm, I expected something around 3:50 when hitting the exit switch.
It looks very improvable, but Adam said it before:

"it suffers from the classic respawn problem that
 the faster you go, the less monsters respawn." 

But 3:30 is easily possible. 
For now, it's your turn again, Adam_W !
