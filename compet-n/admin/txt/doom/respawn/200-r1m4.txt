                That's not quite true as Ralf Schreivogel pointed out.
               
                > If someone is able to pass the lava without any loss,
                > he will propably score something like 190% ...

                Well, again that's not quite true - because nowadays we
                know Rudy's rail (Ralf Schreivogel has discovered it
                simultaneously). So this was very easy, I just figured
                out some foolproof techniques to pass the lava and to
                jump on the "Rudy-Ralf" rail in the first try. In fact it
                has been so easy, one should try it on nightmare too.

      Credits:  Big thanx to Ralf, who mailed me his discovery and ordered
                a 200-r1m4 from me. Here it is ;-)
