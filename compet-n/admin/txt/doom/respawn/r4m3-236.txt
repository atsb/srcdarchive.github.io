  Description:  Hi Jan. This time I strike back, but I definitely
                won't defend any of my entries for real. Squeezing
                seconds just bores me.
                "So why do you play COMPET-N then?!"
                Good question. Well, it always is fun to invent a
                new route - that's why.
