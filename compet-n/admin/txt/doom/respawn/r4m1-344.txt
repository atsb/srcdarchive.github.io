  Description:  I was hasty enough to write:
                >> A specialty of this map is that it is the only map of
                >> udoom/doom2 that cannot be played with 100% kills and
                >> secrets on -RESPAWN. Try to proove me wrong, but don't
                >> forget I'm not "Hunter" Hoof.
                Adam prooved me wrong imedetially in his r4m1-525.
                It seems like every statement like "XYZ cannot be done"
                will be proven wrong. Let's call it the "Hoof" theorem ;-)
                In this case I was just not aware of the possibility to
                get the blue key and the second secret at the same time.
                If you know that trick, it is really not too hard.
                Adam said:

                > when I saw that screen.
                Unfortunately Adams lmp goes out of sync on my system, so I
                could watch only the beginning (from which I learned how to
                get to the secret), but I could not see how many monsters he
                killed. And as I love my keyboard, I killed much to many
                monsters too.

      Comment:  I said it already a few times before, I'm gonna stop Dooming
                now, but I really had to do this map before I quit.
