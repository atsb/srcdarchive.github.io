Description:  Another 15 mins wasted....(anyone heard that one before? :-)
	      Hmmm...maybe I should state some facts: I dunno what got into
              me some weeks ago, but my doom-inspiration is back :) Time to
              do something about epis2 and 3 max ;) 
	 
              We should let Donatas and Arno finish their fights Panter, its 
              cool to watch theese new guys in action. 
              I'll defend this one now though. Thats the nice thing with
              max/fast/respawn- its always possible to squeeze some more 
              secs.... 

              Nice work Donatas and Arno, keep pushing the maps! How about 
              improving r4m5? I'm sure you'll get it below max...IMO most
              respawns should be done faster than max-times..this do not count
              for e4m1, and map09 though :-)
