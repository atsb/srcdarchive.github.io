  Description:  > Can you beat this Rini or Donatas?

                What did YOU expect ?! Btw: you're right, taking the
                superarmor is a complete waste of time. What did I
                estimate for my personal limit - 2:50, if you find
                further improvements it might be even less, but it
                might become very hard to score 100% kills w/o big
                luck with monster fights. Has anyone counted the
                monsters? Does 102% mean that I killed one or two of
                too much? .. must check with Yona's utility.
                So far competing was fun, thank you Donatas and Jan,
                but I fear that there are players around who will do
                it in let's say 2:30 w/o problems - wuite frustrating.
                So I will propably stop this small competition here.

                PS: I got a new unbeatable MMH record (108-r2m1). >If you
                    guys don't hurry up you will need to play a 106-r4m1
                    for an unbeatable MMH record - have fun with that ;-)
