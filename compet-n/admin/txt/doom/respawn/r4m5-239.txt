  Description:  I had to do this again, because the route in the end was
                really stupid - teleporting to the yellow key and not taking
                it ...
                So I analysed the map in more detail (I never have played it
                on max for real, only Velox, Incubus, Pacifist) and optimised
                the route accordingly. I ended with a route very similar to
                Donatas', but with a faster ending (no teleporting to the
                yellow key).

                It's a fun map!

                Btw:
                There are only two secrets in that map and 90 monsters.
