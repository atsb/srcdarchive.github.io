Description:  What a lucky demo! This demo nearly wasn't done, cuz i wanted
              to quit recording when I fell off to slime. Fortunately I
              remembered I could follow Max kill route. The end is really
              very lucky, I mean, I could have fallen off to slime again,
              I could have been killed by the Shotgun guy, or I could have
              finished with 98% kills.
