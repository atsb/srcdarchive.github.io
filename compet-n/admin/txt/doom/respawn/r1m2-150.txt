A very interesting level with -respawn, much fun to play :). I made a 1:56
of this map originally when the record was 2:05, but Adam told me that
Aurican had set a 1:54, so I made a couple of changes and beat it. Main
time saving here is avoiding a lot of the time consuming stuff in the maze.
I avoid the dead end with the imp and trooper in it, and only go half way
up towards the chainsaw (high enough to get the secret armour room), going
back into the red room to kill some enemies to compensate. As you can see,
I could have skipped some enemies in this demo and gone even faster, but
kills ratings tend to come anywhere between 96% and 107% on this map so
I play quite safe to make sure I get enough.
