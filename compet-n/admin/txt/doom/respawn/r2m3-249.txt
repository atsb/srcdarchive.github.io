  Description :

Beats Jan Jansen's record by eight seconds. Still slower than Anders' great
max record though, so should be improved, although again it's the old respawn
problem....going faster means there's less enemies respawning :). I avoid
killing all cacos except the last one and I avoid killing the baron.
