Description: Marko phoned me tonight, saying that he was about to beat
             my 2:04, with a time under 2 minutes. So I decided to train
             a bit today. In my best try, I got exactly 100% kills (checked
             with Boom.exe), but fell off the exit platform. The time would
             have been about 1:54. I am not finished here! :)
