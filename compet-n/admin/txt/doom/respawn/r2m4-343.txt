  C-N entry #21.	Date:02/17/2012

  Description :)
  Before I did e2re2838, I researched all the E2 -RESPAWN records and
  saw quite a few amazing runs but when I watched Radek Pecka's R2M4-348,
  I was unimpressed. What's even sadder is that this level when it comes
  to -RESPAWN entries only has 2 entries, 2 entries on a 1993 wad???
  
  Hopefully competn.mancubus.net (the website where I get my Adam Hegyi
  & pre-Hegyi C-N records from) just hasn't mirrored really old demos and
  there are indeed older entries for R2M4-xxx. Maybe even on
  pre-Ultimate Doom versions of doom.wad/doom.exe.

  Also, vdgg, this file along with R2M4-343.lmp is NOT read-only :p

  Hmm, does vdgg have anything to do with the Van der Graaf Generator band?
  								
  								
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 3:48 by Radek Pecka, timestamped:
  Monday, August 26, 1996, 5:00:26 PM (WTF, This can't be right, what
  the hell does Radek do to his timestampes? Maybe playing on a dead
  or lagging system timer? Or is Steffen at fault and wanted to go
  into the future a few years just to see if anyone noticed?)
