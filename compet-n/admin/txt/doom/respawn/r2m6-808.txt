     Description:

     I like this map though it's quite large. It contains some nice ideas
     like the crusher in the chaingun room, the narrow passage to the
     red_key_card and plasma_gun which is normally blocked by a baron and
     especially the fake exit.
     I've recorded this while practising for my free interpretation of the
     D1M in DHT6, leaving much room for improvement.
