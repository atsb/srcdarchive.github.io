  Description :

I've said it before, and I say it again: When it comes to Tyson, I'm probably
the worst player compet-n has ever seen. Who else here can wander into a room
with two imps, starting with 100% health and dying after punching the air 10
times ?!? And no, this demo isn't out of sync, I DO actually run into every
single corner and wall on the map. Please improve this ugly demo Adam!
