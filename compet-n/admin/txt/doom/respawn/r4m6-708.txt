  Description:  After completing all maps of Doom2 with -respawn I started
                to play some maps of Doom1. This one has been a real
                challenge, it's by far harder than any other map I did
                and only r4m1 seems to be even harder.
                I took it very careful so the recording is rather slow.
                Imo this route is the easiest with respawning monsters,
                try another one and you will see what I mean ...
                What more to say, hmmm - it's important to save cells and
                health and to use the radsuits properly.
                Btw:
                I like that map very much, its design is just brilliant!
                In principle you don't need any key to reach the exit
                (see ep4-par), but it's better to collect all of them to
                survive (you need all keys to reach the invulerability).
                It's the hardest map of Doom and Doom2. Why?
                It is the only map never completed on nightmare, never
                played tyson and not even played under par when starting
                from scratch. A really nice map ...
