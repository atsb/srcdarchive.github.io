  Description:  With  some incredible luck I played it almost completely
                unhit. But than I just forgot or did not dare or did not
                care (or whatever stupid idea came to my mind)  to shoot
                the sargeant on the stairs, so I spoiled that incredibly
                lucky run and ended with 83 instead of 108 :-----------(

      Warning:  It really HURTS to watch this!
