  Description :-)

  Once you survive the initial four shotgunners without getting hit,
  you only need a bit more luck when crossing the yard. Getting the
  Combat Armor and picking up a few  Health/Armor Bonuses certainly
  helps,  just to be on the safe side if/when a Shotgunner smartass
  tries to get you with his special high precision sniper gun.  ;-)

  [ .BAT stuff snipped for briefness - it was getting old anyway! ]
