Description: 	Just incredible that Jan-Endre's record lasted for so long.
                The time seemed very fast to me, but today I just gave it a try.
                First recording was 2:22, so I knew beating 2:17 would be easy.
                
                Considering the 5% overkill and some errors in this demo,
                I think a time under 2:00 shouldn't be impossible...
