  Description:  Hi Steffen ;)
                
                First i got 3:12 twice, then 3:11 twice and finally a 3:10 w/
                75% secrets. Then again, 3:11 and i wasted _ten_ seconds at
                the lift to RL. So, being at the top of my nerves i stopped
                recording just after getting even the slightest improvement :)
                One more reason to stop was that it's now 12:30am and i have 
                get up at 6:30, and i wanna watch Panter's NM run before going
                to sleep :-)

                Personally i used to get better time when taking the RL, even 
                if it's a real waste of time.
