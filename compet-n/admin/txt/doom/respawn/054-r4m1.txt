  Description:  In my r1m7-301 I wrote:

                And Donatas gave it a try. Hey, 106-r4m1 was ment as a
                joke, there are more important things to life than trying
                that. Btw: There are nine potions and not just six
                (that's why the map is so easy ;-), so I ment 109-r4m1
                of course. Note: it is possible to take the rocketlauncher
                w/o any damage. But anyway I guess 80% is the realistic
                limit - who want's to try?

                A specialty of this map is that it is the only map of
                udoom/doom2 that cannot be played with 100% kills and
                secrets on -RESPAWN. Try to proove me wrong, but don't
                forget I'm not "Hunter" Hoof.

      Comment:  Don't expect me to compete any more, I will have simply
                no time to do that in the near future - maybe next year.
              
                If you got new pacifist lmps, mail them to me, do not
                expect me to pick them out of incoming - I did this,
                but I won't be able to do it anymore.

                .. and for those who don't know "DooM - Pacifism"
