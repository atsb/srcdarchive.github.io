  Introduction...

  This is an Example for a New Category of UV -Respawn .LMP's...

  Requirements: 100% (or more) Kills and Secrets OR M.M. Health.


  Description :-)

  Just an initial effort...

  Another rough one... Difficult to get a good balance between
  kills, health and speed... and get THE secret ;-)

  I'm getting better at this... the work P5/90 helps out a bit.
