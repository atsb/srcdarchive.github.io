  Description :-)

  In this level/category combination, the  Lost Souls  are about as
  useless & annoying as they get. #1, They don't respawn. #2, There
  is no kill count on ExM8. #3, Even if there was a kill count they
  still wouldn't count. #4, They're just plain annoying anyway. ;-)

  [ .BAT stuff snipped for briefness - it was getting old anyway! ]
