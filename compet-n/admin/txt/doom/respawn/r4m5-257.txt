                Hi, Donatas. There are still some DOOM -respawn 100/100 maps
                missing - not because they are too hard, but because no one
                planned a route and recorded them. The hardest maps for
                DOOM -respawn 100/100 are r4m1 and r4m6, that's for sure.
                But in some maps it's not too easy to figure out a good route.
                r3m5 is one of them.
