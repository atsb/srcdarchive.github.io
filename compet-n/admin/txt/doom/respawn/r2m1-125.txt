  Description :-)

  I did 1:33 a while ago, but then came Jan Endre and took this map
  with 1:29. I thought that I should strike back in style... giving the four
  seconds back to Jan Endre.
  I did 1:27 quite easily, then came bunches of 98%-125's and 98%-126's
  before I got this run. It could have been a 1:24 if the imp at the exit
  would have cooperated...
  Hmmm... maybe four other secs could be possible... that would really require
  more luck than skill...

  Anyway, you won't believe... it's a 1:25.97... :))
