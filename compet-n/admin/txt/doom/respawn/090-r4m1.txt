  Secrets   50%  and Time  01:08

  Maximum Minimum Health =   90 %

  Description:  I played this while practising for my episode 4 -Respawn
                recording. I take NO damage caused by monsters at all,
                I just loose 10% health while passing the lava. This
                can easily be done w/o loosing health (as you can see eg.
                in 083-r4m1). So it is no joke -
                you can play R4M1 completely unhit!

                BTW:
                I used Raymond Chi's Doom LMP Utility System Version 2.30
                to remove pauses in E4M6 ...
