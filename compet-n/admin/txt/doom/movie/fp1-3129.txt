  Description :-) Not too hard, there is still room for improvement
  with about 1-2 minutes... If I did not dislike ep2 and 3 as much
  as I do, I might try them with -fast... That leaves ep4, which I
  might do if it were not for maps 1 and 2. To do map2 with -fast you
  need a reasonable health figure coming from map1, thus playing it
  safe and alas slow, so that is the reason I will not do it.. No
  more plus 40-50 minutes entries from me..
