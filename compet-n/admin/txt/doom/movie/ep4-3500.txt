Description:

Redid this because the levels I messed up last time were annoying me and I
wanted to get the entire episode (including e4m8) under 40 minutes. I messed
up e4m7 in a major way but other than that I was happy. 

E4M1 (Hell Beneath)
  Hardest level of the lot, down to 11 health.
E4M2 (Perfect Hatred)
  Under three times the compet-n record :)
E4M9 (Fear)
  Gained over a minute on my last time
E4M3 (Sever the Wicked)
  Rocket launchers at point blank range are not smart.
E4M4 (Unruly Evil)
  Lost a second here :-(
E4M5 (They Will Repent)
  Good time, nearly missed an zombie (it wandered onto a lift lowered by a
  lost soul, leaving the area where it should be), luckily it came to get me.
  The cacodemon at the start kindly appeared when I wanted it to.
E4M6 (Against Thee Wickedly)
  Fixed this one up, decent time.
E4M7 (And Hell Followed)
  STUPID! Forgot to pickup the blue key, wasted 30 secs retrieving it. Later
  I thought I heard something so ran around hunting a non existant monster.
E4M8 (Unto the Cruel)
  ~3:45, taking total to 38:45.
