E1M1 - Standard. I finally got a 0:11 here last night :)
E1M2 - Blah, this is an awful run at the start.
E1M3 - Wow. I've been awful at E1M3 last few days, don't know how this came.
E1M4 - It all depends on the yellow door bug, really. 0:17 is rare.
E1M5 - Blah, sucks. I haven't got under 1:00 in this session :(.
E1M6 - Not bad. Could've been 2 secs faster with better spectre killing.
E1M7 - Woo! Good run.
E1M8 - Played it safe again, sorry :).

Well, I said I wouldn't update this unless it got beaten, but hell, I got
bored :). Maybe more to come, 5:0x would be nice. And i'd still like a true
DDQ beater (this is still slower than DDQ over all 8 maps).
