  Description :-)

  This is just a .LMP I recorded for fun of the entire episode 1, including
  the "secret" level E1M9, with 100% kills/secret. It's the second time I do
  this (the first is in my free interpretation for D1SG-YZD.ZIP). It's not
  very fast, but it's not slow. Will anyone do better? It's easy!

  My aiming in this one is terrible because of two reasons:
  1. I didn't care much about it - DooM (1) is so easy.
  2. I was just after a mouse practice so it was hard to return to normal.

  I did get 100% kills in E1M8 because the last rocket in the "butchering
  room" kills the two remaining demons.

  Admin.:
  Don't disqualify me - please! - after all I supplied my own time table!
  Please? And I do wait 5-10 seconds in every end-level screen.

  I'll be happy to get some email with comments!

[  Admin. Note :-)  This kind of entry is NOT the kind of thing I was
   looking for, as missing a monster or a secret would make the whole
   .LMP "invalid", but if that's what you players want to play for...

   So be it ! To beat this entry you must score more kills(!) or more
   secrets(!) (NOT possible) OR go FASTER _without_missing_anything_!

   Oh, how many points does this score --> FOUR ! [ For now ;-) ]
