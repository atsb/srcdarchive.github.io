C-N entry #27, as well as my first movie run.

Well, this certainly was a fun episode to run, no doubt about that.  I made several
improvements to Anders Johnsen's 8:50 along the way, and this is the final result.
The times I made before this were 8:18, 7:39, 7:22, and 7:01, which I still have in my
collection.  There's not much more to say, this is just a really fun episode and a solid
run, plus it has interested me in making more movie runs. :)

I won't add too much more, but I would like to thank a few people who made this run possible:

- Adam Williamson for his support and route ideas.
- ocelot for his support, as well as his experience in movie running. :)
- Dashiva for telling me that 6:4x was possible (I laughed at him when he told me that, but
it's me who isn't going to hear the end of it for laughing now, beh)
- Anders Johnsen for his fantastic 8:50 time, as well as AV in the near future ;)
