  Description :-)

  Thought I'd improve my own run under 4:30... this was pretty easy.

  Some comments on the maps:
  
  E3M1 (Hell Keep):
    A casual start. Usually I get this time here... a couple of 0:37's sometimes.
  E3M2 (Slough of Despair):
    Nothing special. 0:18 would receive a smile.
  E3M3 (Pandemonium):
    Ugh, a bad time. The old run had 0:31...
    This is the map which decides much of your time.
  E3M4 (House of Pain):
    Hmmmm... only one second outside DDQ. Very satisfied with the time.
  E3M5 (Unholy Cathedral):
    A little bit stuck, otherwise nice. 0:27 seems possible.
  E3M6 (Mt. Erebus):
    A nice time I guess, no problems.
  E3M7 (Gate to Limbo):
    Time is good because a lot of things can go wrong here. Especially in an UV
    run...
  E3M8 (Dis):
    Huuuuuh, I thought this would be easy, I had a lot of cells but the spider
    didn't die, then my health went down. I was very lucky that someone took
    care of the spider :))

  This was nice, I like this episode because it's so easy :))
