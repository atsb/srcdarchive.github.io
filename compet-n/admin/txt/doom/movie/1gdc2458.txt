  This is my first try so don't laugh!

  I recorded this on DOOM vs. 1.9 (UV of course)

  If you've got 1.666 then just change the first byte of the
  LMP from 6D to 6A.


  Mission-Level        Time
------------------------------
  1-1                  0'49"
  1-2                  1'36"
  1-3                  3'57"
  1-4                  2'08"
  1-5                  4'27"
  1-6                  6'06"
  1-7                  5'55"
  1-8                  ?'??"
------------------------------
  Total               24'58"


  This time is very beatable, since I wasted some time looking around
  for extra rockets.  Any comments?  E-mail me at gcauthon@umr.edu
