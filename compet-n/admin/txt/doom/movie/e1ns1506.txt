Description:  

	Now i have all my NM100S episodes at Compet-N :-)
        This one sucks, i needed only 3 hours to do it...so
        it'll be beaten by Adam H.'s next harvest :)
        Anyway all the times are under 3:00... and this beats John's by 
        41s. :)
             
        E1M1: hmmm ?? what to say ? :)
        E1M2: eh eh idem :)
        E1M3: in fact, it's rather easy with a chaingun at start :)
        E1M9: easier than i though... 
        E1M4: damn jump.... needed three jumps... => 10s lost => else i would have been                   under 15:00 !!! :(
        E1M5: i often had time probs with this one... this time i'm not to far away of
              John's time :)
        E1M6: not hard... except the exit room sometimes
        E1M7: some probs might occurs but rarely.
        E1M8: i didn't try the jump here :)

        P.S.: I can still do my NM100S episodes faster if Adam_H movies aren't good
              enough :))) (something i'm not sure though:).
