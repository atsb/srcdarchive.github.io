Description:  This beats previous record by a few minutes.
              Anyway, like my e2ns, it's quite slow and safe.
              So it can be beaten easily but DooM 1 kings like
              John R. and the Adams (H. and W.).
              
              
              
         
        E3M1: i did the trick sometimes, but IMO it's a loss of time for a
              movie.
        E3M2: boring...
        E3M3: i skip the soul sphere
        E3M4: do not waste too much of your cells at the start... they are
              usefull for E3M5
        E3M5: a tough one... this route makes it rather easy provided you
              have enough cells. Anyway i did some mistakes with the
              teleporter. It should be easy to beat the record time.
        E3M6: could be faster if i skip the invul.
        E3M9: eh eh i like doing this one with plasma at start :) the pigs
              are no longer a problem
        E3M7: rather easy with plasma... could be faster without some errors
        E3M8: well... the spider is never a problem :)
