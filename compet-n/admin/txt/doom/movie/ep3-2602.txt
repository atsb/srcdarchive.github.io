Comments:

E3M1  -  1:19		:))

Quite awsome to have my personal record on this map on this episode movie !


E3M2  -  2:23		:)

Ugly start. Time is good, though.


E3M3  -  2:37		:|

This map ain't much of a challenge and I usually land at 2:30-2:45.


E3M4  -  5:27		:|

Although this map is big, I have never experienced 98% or 99% kills here.


E3M5  -  4:19		:)

This is where I gain the most from Vincent. Route knowledge is a must here, and one needs
to listen carefully for imps at the end.


E3M6  -  4:17		:)

Luckily, I heard the last imp just before going to the last teleporter... :)


E3M9  -  2:43		:|

Vincent's time here is really good. At this point I was starting to get really nervous...


E3M7  -  2:57		:|

...and I don't even have to tell you how nervous I was here, just look at the demo...! I
ALMOST got killed here, but the extra plasmacells saved my ass.


E3M8  -  ?:??

Still nervous, so I didn't take any chances here.



Additional comments:

Ah, my first compet-n movie. Feels really good now, since I have struggled with it for a few
days in a row. Although I feel that under 25:00 is within my reach, I don't feel the urge of
giving it another try right now... Better go look at the other episodes :)
