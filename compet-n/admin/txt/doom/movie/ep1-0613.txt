  ----------------------------------------

Note: All the routes in this demo are the routes used in the speedrun
records, except E1M6 which goes through the blue sphere secret and E1M1
which takes the DDQ route. As far as I know all those routes were designed
by Anders Johnsen, except the E1M4 jump which was invented by Steffen
Winterfeldt first, if I understand COMPET-N's nostalgia section correctly :). 
This beats Anders' 6:29. I gained 5 seconds with the E1M4 ledge jump, so
this demo is really 11 seconds quicker.

E1M1 - standard run. Always get 0:12 or 0:13 here.
E1M2 - Got the luck you need. Under :26 is just produced by better running.
E1M3 - i'm not too good at this level, even so I prefer :50 or under.
E1M4 - Damnit. Normally do the jump first time and get 0:20 or 0:19, so 4
       or 5 seconds to gain here. Oh, can someone tell me what the deal is
       with the yellow door opening/not opening? It seems somehow to be
       linked to a lift somewhere on the level, but I don't know where and
       I don't know why or how it affects the yellow door...anyone know?
       Thanks!
E1M5 - Great run! Best time ever. Important thing to know about the circle
       bit is that it doesn't matter how fast you are getting back from the
       switch as long as you catch the lift before it goes up for the first
       time...if you get there quicker you just have to wait longer on the
       lift. Strange thing about this run is it looks pretty slow...the start
       wasn't great, I killed off a few unnecessary sergeants outside, took
       a while to get past the pinky...but one thing that saved 2-3 seconds
       was only needing one medikit from the star teleporter room, it's a
       pain to have to go and get the other. The other thing that helped a
       lot was only having to kill one pinkie in the exit room, that's
       another 2-3 secs.
E1M6 - DAMN! That bloody pinky had to get into the switch alcove didn't it?!
       Lost about 8-9 seconds (this would've been 1:20 if i'd got out of the
       switch corridor cleanly, I think), and a lot of health.
E1M7 - Best run yet! Helped by a very nice end section, i'm normally too
       cautious but managed to leave some monsters behind.
E1M8 - Did this as fast as I could safely, a) so it's not too boring and b)
       so this will be the DANG record too. I had enough rockets to try
       just killing the barons straight off, but that's *not* a clever thing
       to try on an episode run :).

This could definitely go under 6 mins, IMO. There's 3-4 secs in E1M3, an
easy 4-5 in E1M4, and at least 7-8 in E1M6..E1M7 has maybe 5-6...so that's
29 secs at minimum to be gained :). Someone gonna take the challenge? :)
