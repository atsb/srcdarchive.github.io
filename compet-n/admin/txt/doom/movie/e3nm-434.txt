  Description :-)
  
  Damn, this run shouts "improve me!"... I'll do
  that sometime when I have more time.
  
  I totally mistimed the BFG on E3M3... bad move,
  losing 3 seconds.
  Also on E3M4 I change to shotgun where I shouldn't,
  losing another 2 seconds.
  Anyway I'm still better than Adam W.'s "best column" ;-)

  Under 4:30 is easily possible, do it if you want to have
  this episode. Temporarily.
