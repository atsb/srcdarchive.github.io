Ever since Anders sent in that 12:04 e1nm run, I've been working on this demo
I set a 'training' routine for myself: 50 tries on tues, thur.  100 on mon,
wed, fri.  150 on sat., sun.  700 tries a week (and it doesn't count as a try
unless i get to e1m3 in decent time)

I have beat 10:13 before.  I have beat 10:00 before.  My previous record,
however, was above 9:30 and I wanted to break that barrier.

Now I have done that, setting 2 new Personal Records for fastest time in-lmp.
I am Happy.

Now we can watch Hegyi spontaneously decide that this was not recorded with
doom.exe, as he has all my other point-worthy demos.
I must point out, though, both e1m5 and e1m6 desynch in a dd47->doom.exe
demo transition, and even I have not been able to answer why.

And all I want is the recognition I deserve.  I have worked long and hard
on this demo.  Nine minutes of near-flawless playing has taken me well over
200 hours of trying, retrying, practice practice practice.  Don't blow this
all with one misinformed judgement based on suspicion and hate.
