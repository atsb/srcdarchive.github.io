General note:
*************
 Oh, finally i have done it. It was quite hard (as usually) to beat Ole's 
 record. I don't know why is only 5 points for this episode. Because it's
 a Tyson-Max episode, you have to use Berserk nearly in every map. 
 It's a pity that total time is again slightly over 30 mins. I had two very
 nice runs which could be under 30:00, but i always died in e2m7. At least
 i didn't lose motivation for playing this episode again. Next time it'll be
 under 30:00, i promise. :) 
 

Comments:
*********

E2M1 - Time under 1:45 is ok.
E2M2 - Ahh.., it really isn't my favourite map. It's easy to get 99% kills
       here. Usually i had time about 3:50.
E2M3 - Yeah, everything went well, my best time ever.
E2M4 - Not bad, sometimes can Barons make problems.
E2M5 - Time is very bad, i had usually about 5:40. I think i could be
       faster with pigs near the normal exit.
E2M9 - 50s is possible, i had to kill last Baron by shotgun, it took me 5 
       secs at least. 
E2M6 - Tyson map.
E2M7 - It's quite easy to die in the start. Time is very bad compare with 
       my c-n record.
E2M8 - I was a bit nervous and a bit scared of lost souls.
