  Howdy,

  This is *the* update, all times are OK :--).

  Some notes about this specific recording:

  E4M1: One of the seldom tries where I play the old route. For a
          better time you must have a look at E4M1-039 ;-)
  E4M2: The problem was when playing E4M1 so fast, what means using
          more rockets than Steffen, I always had problems with the
          cacos before the 'Winterfeldt'-jump. Well I just solved it
          by doing the jump as fast as possible ;-). I changed the
          route for E4M2 very often and think this is the safest and
          still faster than Steffen.
  E4M3: I died here much too often, that's another reason for the
          E4M2 route. And ... one second faster than Steffen ;-)
  E4M4:
  E4M5: Compared to the current best time 0:33 by Yonatan Donner (a
          BIG HI to you ;-) this is a bit slow. But still faster than
          the Master.
  E4M6: That's really OK. My best time is around 2:55, so very pleased,
          that's what I am.
  E4M7:

 Have fun
