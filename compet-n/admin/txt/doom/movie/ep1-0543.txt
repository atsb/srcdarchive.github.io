  ----------------------------------------

E1M1 - standard run. Always get 0:12 or 0:13 here.
E1M2 - Hmm, not too bad.
E1M3 - This is a bad, bad level. I hate it a lot.
E1M4 - Messy. There's a bug at the yellow door which is too icky to go into,
       suffice to say it's annoying.
E1M5 - Pretty good really. There's all sorts of stuff can go wrong here.
       Health is rather low.
E1M6 - Would like 1:15 or lower here. Had to take health at the start. No,
       *please* don't ask me why I didn't use rockets for the spectres, I
       just don't know. Reality failure I think.
E1M7 - This level is really fun. A long, smooth run is required. Health was
       very dicey at the start, MMH of 3% at 100% sphere :)
E1M8 - Rather messy. Tried to be safe.

Well, a 30 second improvement over my last time, not too shabby :). Only
12 secs under DDQ too. I think a DDQ-beating run is possible, with a better
E1M5 and E1M6, maybe 1:05 and 1:10?
