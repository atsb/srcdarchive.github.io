  Description :-)

  Well, I saw Yonatan did it in 38:53 and recorded 8 maps, then I watched
  his version and saw that he did all the maps including the secret one...
  then it became difficult - not the time though - but to get 100%/100%!
  So I started to -record, but always left out a monster here and there:
  for instance, I did it in 35:15 with 99 kills on map 7 ;-( The next time
  I got 99 kills on map 6... On my fifth or sixth try I ended up with this.
  I obviously have to practice maps 6 & 7 a bit more to get a decent time.
  It's very frustrating to have a good time going and end up with 99 kills
  on one of the last maps. If someone watches it, you can see that I make
  some extra sweeps sometimes checking out for forgotten monsters. Luckily
  I did that on map 5!!! Heard the frog sound of an imp and went after him.
