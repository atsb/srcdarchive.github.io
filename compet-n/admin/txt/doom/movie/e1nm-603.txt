Map 8    Do no know the time, but it was close (6% health) :)

Certainly the easiest episode. I still have problems remembering
my ways, I also pressed the wrong button once and wasted a fine
bfg shot on the walls! :) I had to get the mega armor on map 8
since I was not sure that I would sustain the Spidermoron, it seems
I made the right decision, phew! :)
