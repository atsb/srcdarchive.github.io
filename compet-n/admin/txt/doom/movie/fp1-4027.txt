  Description :-) I felt at times I was going to end up as chumus!
  Maps 9, 6 and 7 really suck!!! Anyway, this will do as a first entry!
  I am sure "Marvin The Paranoid Android" will do this faster!

[  Admin. Note :-)  This kind of entry is NOT the kind of thing I was
   looking for, as missing a monster or a secret would make the whole
   .LMP "invalid", but if that's what you players want to play for...

   So be it ! To beat this entry you must score more kills(!) or more
   secrets(!) (NOT possible) OR go FASTER _without_missing_anything_!

   Oh, how many points does this score --> FOUR ! [ For now ;-) ]
