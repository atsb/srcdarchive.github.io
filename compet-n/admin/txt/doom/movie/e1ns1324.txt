  Description:

Heh.  I wasn't going to do this but then I thought, "why not try it?"
You beat my time by 41s vince, so I've beaten yours by 1m42s :).

E1M1: The monsters bring down the lift reguarly enough to insist on a 
      fast time for this level.  I got 0:21 a lot, but a 0:20 was quite
      rare.
E1M2: Lots of mistakes on this level, with monsters constantly in the
      way, fortunately I got a fast exit.
E1M3: Vince's strongest level I think, I equalled his best 2:31 in the 
      run before this one, this time I get my normal time of 2:36.
E1M9: An okay start, but things went a bit awry towards the end, the
      time is okay, but the health was far lower than normal.
E1M4: Tsk, problems here.  I quite often get 0:44, but my concentration
      wandered and I had some problems, that bloody yellow key door
      didn't help either :(.
E1M5: I pushed faster here to make up for lost time on E1M4 and got my
      fastest ever time :)
E1M6: I had real health problems in this level, but once you get to the
      yellow key you're home and dry.
E1M7: I followed my normal safe route on this level without any problems
      until near the end, when I had one of those "route madness" moments
      when you decide to change your plan at the last second.  Here I 
      thought I could run past the imps near the metal switch, it didn't
      work very well :(
E1M8: It didn't quite go as planned, the bloody baron went back into his
      chamber! Grrr...
