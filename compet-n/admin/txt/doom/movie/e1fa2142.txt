Description:

I thought first that I still had a little health to spare even if it was 
on fast monsters because episode 1 had many soul spheres and armors in 
the secrets. It was absolutely wrong. Episode 1 with fast monsters was 
still pretty hard. One mistake leaded to death easily, so I was not able 
to use agressive strategy unlike a single level run. I always had to 
think maintaining health and armor for next maps. Improving an old record 
by over 3 min was great. 

E1M1: It was suddenly hard to survive. Shotgunners always annoyed me,  
so I picked up a green armor for survival with losting a few seconds. 
I did not care much about this map's time because there were a lot 
of rooms to improve in the later maps. 

E1M2: Only a easy map in ep1 on -fast. An imp in a small room where 
there was a shot gun usually cooperated me because it rarely got off 
an elevator. The elevator's timing was also bad in this run, but under
2 min should be always taken. 

E1M3: The beginning part was hard, so I could not be careless until 
I picked up a soul sphere. I changed a route which was not entering to 
a secret exit after picking up a RL because you must go to the secret 
exit in a max movie, so accessing the secret exit twice seemed to be 
a little inefficient. Moreover, it was risky on -fast to jump to a 
narrow walkway with many enemies from a secret near the exit. 

E1M9: This map had too many demons, but some rockets from E1M3 helped 
me. I usually managed to get around 3 min, so 2:49 was a good one.

E1M4: The strategy was so-so... I could not think of anything better 
one. Of course, I did not want to receive suicidal blast damage in 
narrow and intricate passages after a blue key's door. 

E1M5: It was ugly and very improvable one. Especially, it was 
ineffective to deal with enemies under an elevator in front of the 
yellow key's door. 

E1M6: This was hard map, so I used some safe strategies, for example 
not avoiding to close the red key's room and unreleasing all enemies 
at once in the exit area. Certainly they were improvable points, but 
faster ways would be so dangeous. I would polish route in other maps 
before changing this map's route. 4:04 was very nice, because it was 
not far from the UV-Fast record of this map. 

E1M7: The beginning was very hard, so I maintained enough health and 
armor when I started this map. 3:17 was still slow. This map was also 
enough improvable, but missing kills 100% would be easer. I actually 
ruined some movies by missing an enemy in this map.

E1M8: Just for survive, so this was nothing special. I should practice 
a jump to a teleport after killing baron at least.
