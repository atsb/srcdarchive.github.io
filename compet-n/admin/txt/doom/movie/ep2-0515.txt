Note:  Hmmm...very plain episode. This was very easy compared to
       the two other episodes I did. Just ran through it until I had
       this 5:15 someone talked about in his 5:30 (Hi Panter :).
       We could squeez this some more P. if you wanna have a struggle...
       BTW; sorry for not beating your e2m8, but to be honest, I don't
       care much about those ending maps...

       Ok...whats next :) Hmm...(NOT episode3...I hate "Gate to Limbo"!!)
       Lets go grab some NM instead ;)
