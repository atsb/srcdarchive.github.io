  ----------------------------------------

Note:  Beats Anders' very nice 6:31. You can see the main difference from the
times, I took a DDQ-style route through E4M6 (credit to Yonatan). Otherwise..
this is really a pretty easy run except for e4m6, my routes through e4m1
and e4m2 mean they are no longer a problem and the rest of the episode is
pretty much a walkover. Screwed e4m7 up completely though, which is a pity.
3 attempts to make the jump. You can probably tell from the demo that I
didn't know before this run how to get back to the top after missing the
jump, had to work it out :).
