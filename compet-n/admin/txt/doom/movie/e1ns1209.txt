C-N entry #28 and my second movie run. :)

Well, this certainly has been a productive month for episode 1, and well deserved to
be sure.  First with the individual level improvements, then with a new e1nm, and
and finally this.  A very big thanks to Johnathan Rimmer for his route and time as
well. :) Very few alterations to the route could be made.

BTW, the new e1nm (e1nm0659) does not show up in incoming, so you'll have to check the
ftp if you want to see it. :)
