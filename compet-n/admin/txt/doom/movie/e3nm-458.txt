Description: Panter TV proudly presents...the first NM-Movie...

             Wow...don't ask me how long this took...a lot of hours on several
             days...
             Really hard to survive when speeding...WATCH my health (and don't
             try NM with <10% at home :)

             This is the 2nd time I made it...the first one was a 5:08 (:
             With this .recording I reached 99 COMPET-N points...


E3M1: Hmmm....41 is ok...although 37 is possible you have to care about your
      health

E3M2: 19 is nice here...sometimes the souls don't let you pass, then it's a 22.
      btw: YES..I wanted to get the last Medipack (:

E3M3: It is impossible to reach the BFG with 4%...so I quickly changed the
      route...

E3M4: Here I never get below 1:00...1:04 is ok

E3M5: This #*#* crusher was a bit too fast for me...and normally I get to this
      map with at least 150 cells. I had to save at least 40 for e3m7, so I 
      took SG here.

E3M6: Not much to say.

E3M7: I died here several times, so I really tried to stay healthy...ok I
      shouldn't have taken the last Medipacks, this was just a waste of time.

E3M8: After all these hours of excitement... (:
      Sorry but I had to take this one very slow.
