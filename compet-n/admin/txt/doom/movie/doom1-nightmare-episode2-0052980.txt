E2M8 comparison is not relevant. E2M1-E2M7 time is improved by 6 seconds.

Description: My first ultimate doom nightmare episode run.
This was somewhat frustrating, reminded me of my first attempts
at episode 4 uv-speed, where I didn't prepare\practice enough but
I figured "I'd eventually get the luck that I need and get an improvement",
I was wrong.

This took a lot more attempts than what I would have wanted, even though
I feel like this is not even that difficult. E2M7 time is terrible, I knew
my time was more than good enough so I played it safe, so there is quite
a big timesave at the very end for anyone looking to improve it. 
E2M6 was quite good though, much more difficult to reach E2M6 in NM 
than in UV, and that map is pretty much everything in a UV run.

I wasn't planning on playing that safe on E2M8, but I went through
the wrong door at the start and so I slowed things down a bit, I 
really wanted to grab the last soulsphere, of course the cyberdemon
was in that room.

E2M1: Absolute shit map to run on nightmare, sometimes you take 100 damage 
before even reaching the blue key. There are many ways to get through the 
demons on the elevator, unfortunately there is no consistent way. Going 
pacifist and letting the shotgunners hit the demons can sometimes work well,
but I think the method I used here might be the best. Shoot the demons, wait
for them to start moving off the platform and run down the middle. 

44 seconds is not a good time, 2 seconds lost to the previous record. 

E2M2: Usually an easy map, but whenever the demon gets a solid block in
or I miss the switch I lose 1-2 seconds, quite annoying.

E3M3: One of the maps where I really should have spent more time preparing.
There should be enough cells even if you waste some on the demons by the
blue key and the lost souls by the mega armor and also at the very end.

E2M4: I wasted so many damn runs to this map, so many stupid mistakes.
Most of them was getting hit by the barons, which shouldn't really happen 
if you practice those parts enough. Closing the first door before entering
the room was a good idea from e2nm-0351. Not a good time.

E2M5: Easy map, skipping the soulsphere on E2M4 would make it more interesting. 
Not a very good time though.

E2M6: Very happy with this time, most important map of the run since it can
really destroy your run, both with the void glide and the switch press.
However, neither of them requires any luck!

E2M7: I knew my time was more than good enough, so I figured I'd grab the
extra rockets. It's possible to get as low as 14 seconds with my method here.
I use a different setup compared to uv speed, it works every time as long as 
you don't get disrupted by any surviving demons. Terrible time.

E2M8: This was unnecessarily slow, I went through the wrong door and the 
cyber ended up by the soulsphere somehow after I shoot myself with a rocket 
and couldn't figure out which room the soulsphere was in.

Still plenty of time that can be saved, but the first maps are no fun at all.
