When I started recording I wanted to get under 7 mins, which was hard
enough anyway. The problem always was (and is) that the best lmps had
the biggest mistakes in it. I still have a 6:52 recording with a closed
door in e1m6, too bad. The difficulty of this lmp (for a uv run) is/are IMHO
the lots of dangerous scenes. It's very easy to die in M3, M5, M6 and M7...
Still in M4 a lot of things can go wrong and also as you'll see in M2
where I lose a LOT of time compared to other runs... 
However I got under 6:45 (as I finally wanted) and as long as there is
no other lmp I am satisfied with this :-)...
