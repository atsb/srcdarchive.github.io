C-N entry #30 and my fourth movie run. :)

Once again, this run looked like a lot more fun than the plain speed run.  Thanks to
Vincent again for his 12:00 time and route, which I altered only to a slight degree.
I'm sure Adam_H will want to improve this time, I simply wanted a chance to run it
once. :)

I hope he uses this demo to his advantage, a time of under 10 minutes is quite possible,
as you can see.  Onward to episode 4! :)
