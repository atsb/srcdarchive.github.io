  Description :-)

  Well the first time this crazy idea got in my brain, when
  John, Rini and Chris got the first three episodes in 
  NightMare 100% secrets runs. I quickly checked the maps
  for secrets and saw that there aren't actually many secrets.
  But I didn't really have time for such a run until now,
  actually I was trying a month or two ago, but couldn't even
  finish E4M2. It was when I finally made E4M1-E4M2 a few days
  ago, when I started to take it serious.
  
  This run is not much different from E4NM, the easy maps are
  still easy, the hard maps are still hard... I was trying
  for 4-5 days on this, routes ready in my head. Three times
  I got to E4M6 and died... I also had some practice sessions
  with FILLUP.WAD for the E4M6-E4M8 part, which helped me a lot.
  
  Map descriptions follow...

  E4M1 (Hell Beneath):
    This is still the barrier map in this run.
    Play as fast as possible but making no mistakes. My run here
    is a bit slower than usual, earlier I was doing around 0:55.
    The only aim is to survive... (Keygrab by Istvan Pataki...)
  E4M2 (Perfect Hatred):
    After a bit of practice, this gets the same as normal exit,
    just that you can't pick up the extra cells on this route.
    I had to play this quite a lot so I got pretty good running
    here. (Switch from slime by Robert Reevy...)
  E4M9 (Fear):
    This one should be easy but sometimes it's annoying as hell.
    I fell down the ledges many times here, and sometimes the
    baron can kiss your ass too...
  E4M3 (Sever the Wicked):  
    Easy. Never screwed this one up, just have to watch myself
    at the secrets so that I get all of them (if you run too fast
    over the stairs you might accidentally miss them).
  E4M4 (Unruly Evil):
    Easy. I screwed up a BFG shot right at the start but it didn't count.
    Later, I had incredible luck with reaching the elevator (just watch).
    I didn't hear the elevator lowering for some reason, so I kept
    pressing the switch even though it was already down for a few
    seconds. Strange things happen, sometimes...
  E4M5 (They Will Repent):
    I don't like this one but I can do it OK. The ending part is kinda
    annoying, I really don't like it. Had to spare my plasma because
    I wasted too much on E4M4, and I wanted to start high on E4M6.
  E4M6 (Against Thee Wickedly):
    Ah yeah... Even with BFG this map is a bitch. First part till about yellow
    key is OK, I can do it any time, but the rest is just pain in the ass.
    I think I was lucky to get through... Oh yeah and cyber was soooo nice
    to me, pushed me off, but 2nd time there was no mercy...
    (Red key grab by Esko Koskimaa...)
  E4M7 (And Hell Followed):
    This map I never managed to screw up, it's so easy. Just follow a safe
    route and you'll end up over 150/150.
  E4M8 (Unto the Cruel):
    Quite easy since I made some adjustments over my old route in E4NM.
    There's more cells and health in there than any of the previous levels...
 
  By the way, this is my first Ultimate DOOM NM100S run in any episode...
  1/4 of my D1SS (the hardest one) is now finished...
