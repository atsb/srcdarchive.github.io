General note:
*************

Hi Adam W. :-) You can kiss this episode goodbye (and soon nr. 2 as well).
I won't let you have them, beat this as much as you like - I'll just take
it back. This is my first all-through attempt which got 100% kills...

Comments:
*********

E1M1 - Time is not so great. Had 0:38-40 in most tries.
E1M2 - Time is ok. Got 1:51 some times though.
E1M3 - Not much to say here. Not a very good run...
E1M9 - Anything below 2:40 is tolerable...
E1M4 - Awefull time in this movie :-( 2:18 is common.
E1M5 - Some bad parts in the middle, good start and good end.
E1M6 - Ok time. Almost forgot two baddies here and lost quite some time.
E1M7 - Not good...
E1M8 - Who cares?
