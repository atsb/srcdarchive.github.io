*********

   A few days ago Vincent told me on mIrc he had no 
   DooM inspiration at the moment. This could help him
   a little bit. My run is just 5 secs faster than
   his one, but I'm happy for anything below 6mins
   since i'm not good in speedrunning. Anyway, I was 
   hoping for better time in e2m6, but it's kinda hard
   to not awake all those pigs. Pity I can't do the
   rocket jump in e2m7, maybe AdamH wants to step in 
   now ? ;)
