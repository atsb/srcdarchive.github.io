General note:
*************

 Yeaaah......, finally!! It was really very very hard to beat Anders's
 record. I played it about 1 month. The biggest problem in UV max episode
 is always to get all map in 100% kills. I've got many movies when i got
 only 98% in e1m6. It really makes me ungry. :) This movie is quite good 
 except e1m7, that time suxx. I don't know what's happened but i was very
 nervous. Though I'm satisfied with this movie. Btw. when i was recording
 this movie i was watching Sydney 2000 open ceremony. :P
