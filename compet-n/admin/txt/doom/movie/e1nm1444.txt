  Description :-)

Ok, if yer gonna watch my demo ya gotta read my preachings...forgive
me if i ramble on, but i've been thinking of things to put here for
about a week now...

The true difficulty of nightmare lies not in the fast enemies, nor in
them getting back up and shooting you again after you fill them full of
lead.  No, what makes nightmare difficult is the absolute chaos and
prevalence of randomness that you just don't see in a game at Ultra
Violence.

Once one gets used to fireballs that go faster than one can run, and
sergeants reloading and firing faster than the marine can, one can
really do some damage, especially if the skill level is 4 with simply
the -fast parameter.  This is similar to tusing simply the -respawn option,
and also with the combination of the two.  But what nobody really can get
used to is being surprised every time we cross back over our own path.
The enemy are already awake, so they get the jump on us, this time.  No
more picking them off one by one, because chaos is already nipping at our
heels.  Soon our swath of destruction will turn against us with mass
respawns and chaotic enemy placements, quickly eating away our armor,
quickly 

Nightmare is a true test of reaction skills.  Adaption skills.  Tyson,
another challenging method of playing, is neither harder nor easier, but
rather different.  Tyson requires a whole other bag of tricks, like near
perfect health management and flawless monster management.  Nightmare, on
the other hand, tests the reflexes, and the brain's ability to think quickly,
and to repair a route so easily completed in UltraViolence that was just
ruined by a random soldier respawning.  Tyson in constance.  Nightmare is
dexterity.  This is why I respect great players like Lindgren, and Peo...
they have 2 of the most irreconcilable but also most necessary skills, and
they combine them so well as to leave a lasting legacy upon the demo archives
(DL is still what? 3rd, after about a year of Doom Retirement?)  A third
skill, which I respect in a great many players, is the ability to learn
a concrete route over many attempts -- such is seen in MAX or speed
fast demos.  The play becomes extremely fast as the players learn exactly
how the monsters are going to move, and how to best deal with that.  And
a fourth skill which I frankly don't have, but is demonstrated by the best
and fastest speedrunners, is ingenuity.  Rudy's e1m4 jump, Anders's e1m3
nightmare pattern of just blazing through the hallway back from the blue
key...these are the path finders, the ones who make doom possible so fast
and so brilliant.  This is the skill I respect most, because it is one I
just cannot for the life of me grasp.  I am merely the optimiser...I run
the levels a million times to cut the last corner tighter, to shave off the
thenths of a second, squeeze the last drop of speed out of the patterns that
have already been invented.

I would like to thank all you people who still do demos for Doom...
especially those whose tricks and/or routes I borrowed.  Keep dooming, keep
demoing, and most of all enjoy the lmp! :-)
