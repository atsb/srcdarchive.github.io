Description:

My first COMPET-N entry where I get to kill monsters :) About eight
minutes faster than Joe Breen (Hey! A fellow Aussie in COMPET-N!), most
of the improvement came in e4m2 (nearly five minutes). All of the times
are *very* suboptimal, I just sat down and started playing through
without thinking about strategy, or even making sure I knew where the
secrets were... This will probably get beaten in a couple of hours, but
who cares. A time of 30 min would be very good.

The levels:

E4M1 (Hell Beneath)
  This level scares me.
E4M2 (Perfect Hatred)
  Great level which really rewards aggressive play. I didn't make the
  Winterfeldt jump, but the BFG trick is almost as useful.
E4M9 (Fear)
  I had no strategy at all for this level, so the time is a bit sad.
E4M3 (Sever the Wicked)
  Rocket heaven... some great firefights in this level.
E4M4 (Unruly Evil)
  Nice small level.
E4M5 (They Will Repent)
  Oh dear. Watch me play 'hunt the secret'. Wasted at least two minutes
  here. This is why you need a route...
E4M6 (Against Thee Wickedly)
  Great level. Time is good, for me.
E4M7 (And Hell Followed)
  Hunt the secret part 2... I was really lucky here, found the first secret
  by accident :) Then I wasted another two minutes trying to find some
  nonexistent ones.
E4M8 (Unto the Cruel)
  Played it nice and slow.
