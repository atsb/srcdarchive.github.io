  Description: Just an initial entry - ok? Please don't blame me for
               the terrible performance, after not dooming for quite
               a while I felt very rusty :(
             
 Comments on
      levels:  E2M1 - Played it safe. Plasma in the first level,
                      this is the plasma-episode.
               E2M2 - Who can count my mistakes here? I even got crushed
                      and missed the exit jump - terrible performance
               E2M3 - Just terrible
               E2M4 - This is for the curiosity collection,
                      I do not trigger the crusher trap
                      (you propably didn't know that there is a trap,
                       but if you play this map w/o the speed on key
                       as I did back in 1994, you will see that it IS a trap)
                      I have never seen this happen before and really
                      was surprised, but I changed my route accordingly
                      (no killing of the lost souls needed).
               E2M5 - I still don't know how to handle the lost souls in the  
                      secret exit area.
               E2M9 - Say hello, nice map.
               E2M6 - Very slow - very safe.    
               E2M7 - Do not know why I almost died here.
               E2M8 - First I whimped out and went for both soulspheres,
                      then cybie was chicken and tried to hide in one of the
                      rooms. Stupid cybie! I prefer the duell in the
                      open arena, it's much more fun and MUCH faster.
