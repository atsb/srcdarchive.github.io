Description:

After doing this with -fast I wondered how hard the max record would be.
Well, this is nearly the 26 minutes Ian talked about. But of course this can
go faster, if you pushed it you could probably get as far as the ep1 max
record.

The levels:

E4M1 (Hell Beneath)
  Pretty good run.
E4M2 (Perfect Hatred)
  Some missed BFG shots, lost about 10s here.
E4M9 (Fear)
  I have the record here, but this is only so-so. You have to check for
  monsters.
E4M3 (Sever the Wicked)
  Okay... wasted rockets.
E4M4 (Unruly Evil)
  Urgh, terrible... didn't have enough rockets and had to change my route.
  Bad plan...
E4M5 (They Will Repent)
  Bit tense at the start, as I forget how to aim :(
E4M6 (Against Thee Wickedly)
  Happy with the time.
E4M7 (And Hell Followed)
  *Really* happy with the time :) Not far outside the record...
E4M8 (Unto the Cruel)
  Easy, just don't miss a monster...
