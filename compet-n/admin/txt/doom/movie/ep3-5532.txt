  Description :-)

  I recorded episode 1 a very long time ago with 100% kills, at the time I
  thought episodes 2 and 3 would be too long and boring to do. Then I did
  episode 2, and thought episode 3 would be too long and boring to do. So
  today I did episode 3, and yes, it was long and boring ;-)

  This is my first try and I don't know the levels very well, so the times
  aren't great, I also don't like these levels too much, Hell Revealed will
  be so much better ;-)

  There was a pause in E3M6 when I had to open the door (in reality, not in
  DooM ;-) but I removed it so the viewer will have absolutely nothing to
  disturb him when watching the lmp ! :-)

  These levels are all very easy so occasionally I switch to fist and punch
  some monsters to make it more interesting (for me), I hope you don't mind.
  Not much else to say, these times really shouldn't stay here, so come on
  people, beat that !

[  Admin. Note :-)  This kind of entry is NOT the kind of thing I was
   looking for, as missing a monster or a secret would make the whole
   .LMP "invalid", but if that's what you players want to play for...

   So be it ! To beat this entry you must score more kills(!) or more
   secrets(!) (possible) and/OR go FASTER _without_missing_anything_!

   Also, since this is so long and Yonatan has supplied his own table
   of data - Thanks Yonatan - I'll just believe the overall time that
   he claims and we'll accept that he missed only a few (?) secrets.

   Oh, how many points does this score --> FOUR ! [ For now ;-) ]
