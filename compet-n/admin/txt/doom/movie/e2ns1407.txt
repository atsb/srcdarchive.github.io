C-N entry #29 and my third movie run. :)

This run looked like a lot more fun than the vanilla nightmare run and much easier than
E1NS.  Special thanks to Vincent Catalaa for his route and time of 16:58, as well as
Chris "Ryback" Ratcliff for some of his individual nm100s routes for the later levels
(e2m5, e2m7).  Only needed about an hour to get this time.
