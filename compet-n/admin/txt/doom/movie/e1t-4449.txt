YEAH! This was a pretty fun demo to make. Not a bad time - it beats a lot of
records not because i'm amazing but because I start the levels with lots of
pistol ammo and a chainsaw, which helps no end :).

E1M1 - not a great run. I don't use the record method as I lose too much
health when I do and it doesn't give you the blue armour (which is very
important to preserve health. People neglect armour a lot...don't! A blue
armour picked up from no armour is equivalent to a 100% health bonus, a
green armour equivalent to 50%!) I've done 1:10 with this route.

E1M2 - urgh. This level is slowed down by the method I use at the start,
which is necessary due to lack of pistol ammo. After that it's pretty
bog standard.

E1M3 - not as hard as it might seem starting with ammo and a chainsaw.
I don't often die here. This is a good run for me, I was usually around
the 6:30 mark.

E1M9 - This is the first map with a really hard part. The end is *so* easy
to die on. If you get a spectre in front and one to the side, you're dead.
If the imps play up at the bottom, you're dead. If the sergeants cross the
bridge, you're often dead. Argh! Only consolation is that if you survive,
even with 1% health (which i've done), you can go back and pick up a couple
of medikits at the star trap, which, with the one at the exit and the one
at the start of E1M4, get you back to 100%.

E1M4 - I was pretty cautious at the start here, as the run before the sergeant
from the right-hand area had sneaked up behind me while I was dealing with
the imps in the left-hand area...left me with 21% going into the slime and
the sergeant down there killed me :(. Did the maze fairly cautiously too,
no point alerting too many monsters and getting stuck between demons. Apart
from this danger, not a hard map.

E1M5 - interesting map. In fact easier than it seems, if you handle the
start of the circular area well (with the demons, imps and troopers on the
lift.) I have dropped to 1% there once or twice...:)

E1M6 - aaarggghhhh! The tyson map of nightmares. Fairly straightforward up
to the second blue sphere, bu then it's really nasty. That trap at the
end is an absolute *killer*. You'll see what happened here - I got drawn out
of the hidey-hole when chainsawing sergeants (if you don't kill them you
don't stand a chance, but you can't switch to pistol and back without being
eaten by a demon). I thought it was curtains then (it usually is), and it
almost was...but I just managed to fend off the spectres long enough to
grab some health. The standing around at the end was to check no monsters
had somehow got trapped outside the room (has happened to me before, not on
a tyson run though - this is the first time I made it through this map on
tyson in a full episode run).

E1M7 - pretty easy level, was a bit stuck for ammo at the start though. I
took this incredibly slowly and cautiously because I had just made it
through E1M6 for the first time and didn't want to screw up :). The record
time here is pretty damn good, though. Used pistol a hell of a lot to make
sure I didn't take silly hits and die.

E1M8 - much easier with a chainsaw, thanks :). Again, slow and cautious. The
time is derived with the standard COMPET-N method using LMPC.

Enjoy the run...
