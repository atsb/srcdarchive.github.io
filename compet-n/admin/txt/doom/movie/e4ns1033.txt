C-N entry #31, movie run #5. :)

Well, I was warned well before I started this episode that it is a royal pain in the
ass to run on nightmare skill.  The first two levels are tough, and the ultimate
ass-kicker E4M6 is the level that all of the hard work builds up to.  In the end, it
seemed like the route I use for E1NM gave me more difficulty.. this run took somewhere
between 5-6 hours to do, but I still believe this one is VERY tough.  This concludes my
improvements to the 4 udoom NS runs and one hell of an update. :)  Thanks once again
to those who previously ran this, Adam_H and Vincent Catalaa.  This movie is basically
the same run, only faster. :)

"Next stop, Hell on Earth!"
