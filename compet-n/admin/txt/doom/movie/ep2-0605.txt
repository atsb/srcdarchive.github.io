  Description :-)

  My second episode run... in a day :)
  Beating Jonathan "Hunter" Hoof by exactly seven minutes ;)
  And beating Steffen Winterfeldt by 10 secs, hehe :)  
  I leave breaking 6 mins to someone else...
  IMHO something like 5:30 is possible here w/o connecting...
  Some comments on the run:
  
  E2M1 (Deimos Anomaly):
    Quite good. Watch your health when you record this!
  E2M2 (Containment Area):
    Using the switch trick. Nothing else to say.
  E2M3 (Refinery):
    Had some problems with the lost souls. 0:40 is easily possible.
  E2M4 (Deimos Lab):
    The caco got in the way on the stairs, and I had to save plasma, but
    luckily I got through. Under 0:50 is possible.
  E2M5 (Command Center):
    Quite bad run. I should have gotten 0:34 or so.
  E2M6 (Halls of Damned):
    This is hell! The main problem areas are the yellow door entrance with lost
    souls/caco and the dark room entrance with demons/baron. Here I managed
    them fairly.
  E2M7 (Spawning Vats):
    A disaster run, should have been some 15 secs faster. I hate that key
    trick!
  E2M8 (Tower of Babel):
    The amount of rockets I miss due to excitement is a world record :)
