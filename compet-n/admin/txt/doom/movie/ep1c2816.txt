  Description:  One of the most classic tasks!
                Doing the old episode 1 with fist and chainsaw only.
                I tried this back in '93 after completing episode 1,
                ending each map with the highest possible health and armor.
                Of course I used "Save game" thousands of times, no way to
                record a level in one try. I did not even know that doom can
                record demos.
                But even with saved games I did not succeed to do the
                endlevel.

                Well, times have changed - nowadays a recording like this is
                rather easy to do. It's surprising that noone has done it
                before.

                Some comments on the maps:
                E1M1 - Well, this route was not possiblle with the old
                       shareware version.
                E1M2 - Get the 'good old' chainsaw.
                       Some say it is rusty and old ...
                       ... but in contrast to the berserk fist
                       it last for more than only one map.
                E1M3 - A very nice challenge.
                E1M4 - I lost my orientation in the end.
                E1M5 - I'm still no expert here.
                E1M6 - A bit too long to be fun.
                E1M7 - Propably the hardest map, but I'm very used to it.
                E1M8 - I made the barons fight each other without any
                       problems. All went perfect, maybe too perfect, so
                       I felt VERY strong and lost my respect of the
                       surviving baron of hell and acted without the
                       apropiate concentration. Scratch, scratch and I
                       was down on 12% health. You can see how I struggled.
                       On the one hand I REALLY wanted to finish that
                       recording (it was my first real try and I like those
                       the most), on the other hand I did not want to look
                       like a complete chicken.

       Some words on violence in computer games:

       When looking at a DOOM demo you might think that
       the author acts aggressive in real life too.
       That it might even be likely that he starts killing
       people or animals just for fun.
       Let me tell you that I really know the difference
       between real life and a computer game and I am pretty
       sure that all the DOOMers I know do as well, even
       those who are only thirteen years old.
       But there really might be a problem for little
       children and even I (beeing gorn in `69) would prefer
       the graphics being less bloody and less violence
       glorifying.
       I hope that gamedesigners as well as movieproducers
       will stop the inflation of displayed violence.
