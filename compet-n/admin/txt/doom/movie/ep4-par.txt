  EP4-PAR.LMP - All levels under par

  Recorded using The Ultimate DooM Version 1.9

  DooM - Episode 4 - Thy Flesh Consumed


  Description: It IS possible to play e4m6 under par in a multilevel
               recording - that's what I wanted to proof by making this LMP.
               The performance is quite bad, many fall downs and other stupid
               things. But anyway the episode 4 lightning is POSSIBLE
               (and by far easier than I had expected).

  Map	 Time	 PAR	Comments
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  E4 M1	 1:11	1:30	The key trick makes it much easier
  E4 M2	 1:57	2:00	Very close to PAR because of two stupid fall downs
  E4 M9	 1:01	1:30	Plenty of time in here, the backpack is very useful
  E4 M3	 1:30	2:00	I should have used the high PAR time better
  E4 M4	 1:04	1:30	
  E4 M5	 1:43	2:30	Extremely high PAR time
  E4 M6	 1:58	2:00	Very short PAR time, makes it extremely dangerous
  E4 M7	 1:31	2:00	Use a slow and safe route here
  E4 M8			No time given
