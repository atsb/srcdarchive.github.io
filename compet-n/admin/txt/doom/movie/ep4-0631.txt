Note:  Well, not much to say...Did this cause episode 4 consists of my 
       favourite maps :) E4M6 is hardly worth watching, got stuck on
       a lostsoul, and later on I had to deal with a very, very intelligent 
       Baron which decided to gard redkey instead of hunting me....
       All times should be faster than Anthe's, maby except from the 
       excluded E4M8...Route-credits goes to Anthe, though I made certain
       changes to them (and of course exit-strafed in E4M7).
