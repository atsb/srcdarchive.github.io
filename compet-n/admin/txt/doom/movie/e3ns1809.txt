Description:  Rini's e2ns run (a much harder run) inspired me to try this.
              I thought it would be fun, and it was :) There's heaps of 
              room for improvement here, anything from five to ten minutes
              can be taken off...

        E3M1: It doesn't look it, but this is the fastest time I got.
        E3M2: Very much the usual. 
        E3M3: I take ages doing some of this level, but it's very easy.
        E3M4: Got very ragged at the end, when the double door closed on me.
        E3M5: Anything can happen here...
        E3M6: Needed both invulns, but no problem.
        E3M9: Wasn't going to play the start risky...
        E3M7: Took this very slow and killed as many demons as possible.
        E3M8: Got a bit dangerous, for some reason the Baron didn't want to
              fight the spider. Luckily I got a caco to help. He even 
              finished the spider off for me :)
