  This is my fastest time for episode 2 of Doom vs. 1.9.

  If you've only got vs. 1.666 then just change the first byte
  from 6D to 6A.


  Episode-Level     Time
--------------------------
  2-1               1'30"
  2-2               3'13"
  2-3               1'59"
  2-4               2'49"
  2-5               2'40"
  2-6               6'19"
  2-7               6'29"
  2-8               ?'??"
--------------------------
  Total            24'59"


  I'm sure this isn't the fastest time, but it's good enough
  for me. Any comments?  Send E-mail to gcauthon@umr.edu
