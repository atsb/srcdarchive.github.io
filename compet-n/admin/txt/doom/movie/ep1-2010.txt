General note:
*************

 Well, it's not bad. I've played it just for fun. But i also know that Andy
 is slowly finishing AV project, so it isn't bad idea to start improving
 my demos, you know. :) The total time looks good, even the first four
 maps are slower than in previous demo. I saved a lot of seconds in map5 
 and in map6. I'm quite satified, but next time it will be below 20:00, 
 trust me. :)
 

Comments:
*********

E1M1 - About 35s is it ok.
E1M2 - As usually, very bad start.
E1M3 - Damn, i wanted to have it below 3:00.
E1M9 - Oh shit, the worst time of this demo.
E1M4 - It's really not bad, my best time of this map in episode run.
E1M5 - Very good, i was very lucky here.
E1M6 - Time is ok.
E1M7 - This is not my favourite map, coz it's easy to get 99% kills here.
       As you can see i was lucky that i spotted that second soldier, hehe.
E1M8 - Sweet end.
