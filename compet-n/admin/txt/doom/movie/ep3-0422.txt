E3M1 - DAMN DAMN DAMN this is an annoying level. It's just good that it comes
       first...in E1 the bastard levels come late, in E2 there's e2m7, and
       in E4 there's e4m6. Main problem here is the corridor of pinkies...
       the difference between 2 shots to kill the first one and 3 shots can
       end up being 4 seconds!
E3M2 - Oh my _god_. Would someone like to tell me what the hell happened here?
E3M3 - Hehe, this is my speciality :). I'd like to do 0:27 sometime.
E3M4 - This level is a complete _bastard_ from scratch, using the yellow key
       trick. In an episode run, it's a complete blast - you get to fire
       plasma all over the place and you don't need to bother with the key
       trick :).
E3M5 - YEAH! this is _good_. Getting that blue key first time can sometimes
       be annoying, and the rest of the running is good.
E3M6 - Hmmm. Didn't go brilliantly. Didn't quite have enough plasma to just
       keep firing, really.
E3M7 - Phew. This is a fiddly little level to have so late in an episode run,
       it's very easy to miss the yellow key jump and lose 3 secs or so.
       Also it's one of those levels where something completely bizarre can
       happen and just stop you dead in your tracks, like an unexpected herd
       of pinkies or something.
E3M8 - Well, I'm *very* cautious here, for reasons detailed later :). This
       is far more fun on a DANG run, because you get the BFG in e3m3...

Damn, I thought this would be a fairly easy record at first...my first
finished effort was 4:42 under compet-n rules, and that had a 1:24 for
e3m7 :). It probably would have been easy if it hadn't been "one of those
days"...first I made 4:19 and died on e3m8 because I forgot to pick up the
blue armour, then I equalled the record...TWICE...geesh. Got it now though.
My prediction for a reasonable time? Hmm, well...probably 0:40, 0:17, 0:28,
0:49, 0:27, 1:04, giving 4:14. The optimum you could really go for would
be 0:38, 0:17, 0:27, 0:46, 0:25, 1:03 giving 4:05. To get under 4:00 you
really need things like a speedrun-style E3M1 (leaving the problem of the
jump on e3m3), the e3m4 yellow key trick and the e3m7 exit jump...
