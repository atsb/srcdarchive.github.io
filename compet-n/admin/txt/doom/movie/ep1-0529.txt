E1M1 - standard run. Always get 0:12 or 0:13 here. Not sure if 0:11 is poss.
E1M2 - Silly mistakes here.
E1M3 - I'm getting better at this level...still hate it though. I've done
       0:42 four times now, 0:43 three.
E1M4 - Optimal for an episode run, pretty much, what with that yellow door.
E1M5 - Pretty decent.
E1M6 - Hmmmm. Just takes too _long_ chaingunning everything in the last room.
       Not much else to do though really, just running it like a scratch run
       is too risky.
E1M7 - Started well, but _man_ I was wetting myself by the end :).
E1M8 - Very, very safe :)

Well, 2 secs faster than DDQ over the episode, not bad eh? :). I know I could
do better...I had lots of amazing starts, including one which went 0:12, 0:24,
0:43, 0:19, 1:07...then the door trick went wrong on E1M6. Doh. But, well, I
think this one should stand for a while :)
