  Description :-)
  
  The easiest Ultimate DOOM NM Episode, so I thought I'd give it a try.
  Of course my goal was not just beating Peo's 6:03 but to satisfy myself.
  Well, with this run I'm fairly satisfied. I hope it'll stand longer than
  my ep2 run... :)
  IMHO inside 5:00 is possible.
  Let's see the levels:

  E3M1 (Hell Keep):
    Here it went fairly well. Notice the "three imps fall dead by one SG shot"!
  E3M2 (Slough of Despair):
    The easiest of the levels, yet I hate it. Here it went fair.
  E3M3 (Pandemonium):
    With the route I used, time is very good. Maybe invul/BFG could be skipped.
  E3M4 (House of Pain):
    I'm very satisfied with this one. Everything went as I wanted.
  E3M5 (Unholy Cathedral):
    Also good. Not much can be improved here.
  E3M6 (Mt. Erebus):
    Could be a bit better. But I was happy that health was OK.
  E3M7 (Gate to Limbo):
    A very bad run indeed, I was surprised that I actually did 1:16. 1:10 is
    possible here.
  E3M8 (Dis):
    Although I had 84% of health, I played safe. Spider Mommy can surprise you
    in Nightmare style!
