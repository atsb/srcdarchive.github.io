C-N entry #100(!), movie run #24.

Well, here I am, going back to the beginning with more movie
experience (a lot more, this was previously my second movie
total).  This is still one of my favorite movies to play, and
it was certainly a lot easier to play now than before. I hope
you enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed making it, again. :)

A big thanks is also in order for those who previously did this
episode, Johnathan Rimmer and Vincent Catalaa.  This run would
not be possible without them because I'm a route-leeching lamer. :)
