C-N entry #142, movie run #28.

E4M1: Smooth run, OK time.

E4M2: Slower than Adam, I make sure to grab all cells from the last
      room.

E4M3: Picking up the backpack makes a difference later (lots of cells).

E4M4: The demons slowed me down at the start, OK time.

E4M5: Another demon slows me down here, almost overshot the exit jump.

E4M6: MUCH easier than the nightmare run, with the BFG the cyberdemon
      is easy to take down.

E4M7: The only reason this run was improved was getting the exit jump
      on the first try.  Adam, I feel your pain: a few previous movies
      had me missing the final jump 3-4 times, even though I nailed it
      every time when I practiced. :)

E4M8: I didn't slow down for much here, I was much less nervous here
      than for the e4nm, so I thought it would help make the movie nice.

Adam asked me to consider this one a long time ago, and xit did recently
after I uploaded the e4nm.  I didn't invest a lot of time in this, so maybe
it could see another improvement from another player with some more time.
Also, I'm sorry, but the same teleport on e4m1 makes this demo desynch in
PrBoom.  Maybe this will be worked out eventually, but if not, sorry. :(
