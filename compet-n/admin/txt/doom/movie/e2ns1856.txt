Description:  After doing e1ns for dang, I decided to try e2ns. Got this
              after a bit. Looks very sloppy in bits, but it's fun recording
              when speed isn't so much of an issue. Most of the time I went
              Rini's way.
         
        E2M1: Usual
        E2M2: nice... the pigs are annoying 
        E2M3: hmmm...
        E2M4: almost died cause of a stupid pig
        E2M5: the main problem is to get through the room with all the skulls surronding 
              you.
        E2M9: nice
        E2M6: a level i never mastered...
        E2M7: cool... could be faster if i hadn't took the route of the record
        E2M8: safe way to kill cybie... i didn't want to waste this run
