*********

E2M1 - Usual time ... got some 0:48-0:49 sometimes.
E2M2 - ok.. got a 0:16 with berzerk one time
E2M3 - well... sucks ..i lose some time to awake the pigs... but it's easier.
E2M4 - not too good
E2M5 - abit slow, the imp needed 2 shots...
E2M6 - 12s faster than Andy... that's my best :)
E2M7 - well... roughly 1:02 faster than Andy :)... the run went quite well
       and i had a lot of cells after E2M6 which is quite rare :)
E2M8 - ate a rocket :)...under 1:00 is ok.

I'm happy to beat a run of Andy with such a margin :)
He will have a lot of work after the release of AV :-)
