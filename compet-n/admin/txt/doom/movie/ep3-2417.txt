General note:
*************
 Well, now is my collection almost complete. Only ep4 is missing, of course,
 but i think i'll not go for it, because i don't know that episode at all.
 In this demo a was a few times nearly dead..heh...but i had to play
 risky to beat Ole's record. It wasn't as hard as episode2 to get it, 
 because i've already known all maps except e3m5. This episode is sometimes
 really Inferno, because there is a lot of Lost souls and i hate those 
 bastards. Anyway, total time could be about 23:00, definitely. Special
 thanks to all guys who showed me the right route through all maps.
 
 

Comments:
*********

E3M1 - this map was a kind of lottery for me, because my times were ranging
       from 1:20 to 1:40. Yeah, no ammo, no fun. :)
E3M2 - first time i was nearly dead, i had only 2% health and Lost soul was
       flying around my head, but then i picked up a medikit, cooled down
       and carried on killing. I was in trouble with Lost souls at the end
       as well, i had to spend a few cells for them.
E3M3 - I was a bit lucky with that BFG shot (near Berserk room), because
       i wasn't sure if i can kill that Caco which was round the corner,
       furtunately i killed it too.
E3M4 - Time is not bad, even c-n record is much more faster.
E3M5 - I'm always a bit confused of this map (as you can see). It's also 
       a bit hard to get 100% kills here.
E3M6 - I was nervous at the end, because i wasn't sure if all shotgun guys
       are dead.
E3M9 - It could be faster, i know. I tried to kill Cybie by 2 BFG shots,
       but 2 cells were missing for the second shot, so i had to kill him
       by rockets.
E3M7 - I had a lot of rockets from the previous level, so it wasn't any 
       problem to kill all animals.
E3M8 - As easy as killing bunny by axe. :)
