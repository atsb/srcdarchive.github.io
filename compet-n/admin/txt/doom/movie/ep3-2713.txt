E3M1 - A quite tough level, Kai's time seems unreachable.

E3M2 - I hate this level, sometimes a pig got stuck in the maze.

E3M3 - I heard a pig, i had to seek it... 20s lost ? 

E3M4 - The first big level

E3M5 - Easy to get lost with the teleporters

E3M6 - I lose some time to check if all monsters are dead

E3M9 - This one came really well ! nearly under  par !  

E3M7 - very easy level compared to the others

E3M7 - no probs with the Spider


I'm not a good max player. I wanted to do a max run for PublicDANG 
and i realized that i've beaten Michael Greenslade's run but about 
7:00 !

Under 25:00 is really possible
