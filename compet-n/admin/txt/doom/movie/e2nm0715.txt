Note:
*****
Well, this didn't require many loud words :-) But it costed me a new phone -
I smashed the other one in anger when the damn thing started ringing in the end
of a very nice "beyond e2m6" run I had, and completely messed up my 
consentration! Oh what the heck, I've got a new (although much slower) run now.

Comments:
*********

E2M1 - Fast enough. But 1:13 Andy?? Naa...
E2M2 - 18 secs is tolerable when getting berserk.
E2M3 - Have had some better 0:4X's but I'm pleased.
E2M4 - Not good, should at least be three secs faster.
E2M5 - Ok time using this route...
E2M6 - One second slower then Andy....Hmmm...his run was good here.
E2M7 - Oh boy :) This is just awefull! I ran the wrong way actually, so time
       is not that bad counting my bad route :)) I should have gotten the
       second invurnerability when returning from the bluekey-garden, not
       before. And I also got misslead in the gray corridors before yellowkey.
       I could have earned lots of time here, I was infact considering aborting
       the run at one point. Imbarresing, but what the heck.... 
E2M8 - Mother f...'ing soules all over the place...

As a closement to this run I'd like to state an opinion of mine: Although 
Peos' old run have been beaten by quite some time by both Andy and me, none
of us came close to executing it with such style. Peos' run is *very* stylish
and at least as fun to watch. Speed is _not_ everything...
