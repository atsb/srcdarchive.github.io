  Description :-)

  After I recorded episode 1, I didn't want to record the other episodes
  because they were (I thought then) too large. Quake has come out in the
  meantime, but I've already finished it on "hard" and I wanted to wait
  before recording Quake demos (maybe the demo format will change soon). The
  final factor is that I went to the dentist and returned with half my face
  paralyzed, so I decided to kick some ass (revenge?).

  First I tried some e1m1, but after 30 minutes of trying the best I got was
  0:37, several times 0:38 and I gave up the 0:33.

  So I recorded the entire episode two on ultra-violence with 100% kills and
  100% secrets too except E2M5 (what didn't I find there?). It was very easy
  like I expected (first try) and I even got it half a minute under one
  hour.

  If you want them, here are some comments about the levels:

  E2M1 - Deimos Anomaly
  ---------------------
  A very easy level. I also did it in 1:55, which is the current COMPET-N
  record.

  E2M2 - Containment Area
  -----------------------
  A large, ugly, boring level. The entire level is crates, crates, crates,
  imps, demons. Oh yes, there is also one lost soul somewhere in there. I
  got lost many times, but the time is much less than I expected.

  E2M3 - Refinery
  ---------------
  This level is not too bad. It's a little short. No special comments (sorry
  folks but I did kill the lost souls).

  E2M4 - Deimos Lab
  -----------------
  Pretty ugly level. I also did it in 7:33 in COMPET-N.

  E2M5 - Command Center
  ---------------------
  A very ugly, boring, large, etc. level. Easy to get lost. It was nice
  having rockets here for a change. I did it in 9:58 in COMPET-N.

  E2M9 - Fortress of Mystery
  --------------------------
  A nice level with a nice idea. I did it with 100% everything and under
  par, too. (The par time should be 0:30 to suit the rest of the game, but
  maybe this level was originally designed so that the door to the keys
  won't be secret but will just open when you kill all baddies, Dead Simple
  style.)

  E2M6 - Halls of the Damned
  --------------------------
  Another ugly, large, boring etc. level. * YAWN *

  E2M7 - Spawning Vats
  --------------------
  Not too bad but not too good. I finished with too much ammo, considering
  that the next level is E2M8.

  E2M8 - Tower of Babel
  ---------------------
  A nice one, it was easy killing the cyberdemon though I missed way too
  much. I didn't get hit throughout the whole level though.

  Admin.:
  Don't disqualify me - please! - after all I supplied my own time table!
  Please? And I do wait 5-10 seconds in every end-level screen.

  I know what you expect to find in this line, but no I won't write it here,
  I've had enough of writing it and I won't write it anymore. But to make up
  for it, I'll write: "I'm still waiting for The Final Doom to get to
  Israel." There.

[  Admin. Note :-)  This kind of entry is NOT the kind of thing I was
   looking for, as missing a monster or a secret would make the whole
   .LMP "invalid", but if that's what you players want to play for...

   So be it ! To beat this entry you must score more kills(!) or more
   secrets(!) (NOT possible) OR go FASTER _without_missing_anything_!

   Oh, how many points does this score --> FOUR ! [ For now ;-) ]
