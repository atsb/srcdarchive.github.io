Comments:

YEAHHHHHH! I knew I could beat Anders' record...after many many tries, and
lots of really weird ways of screwing up, I finally got it...by 1 second! :)
Individual level comments:

E2M1 - Bit slow, but if I stuck around trying to get :41 and :40s here i'd
       be here forever...:). Personal best is 0:40.
E2M2 - Standard run. In episode runs I tend to go a bit too far along the wall
       and work my way back to make _sure_ I hit the switch. PB is 0:17.
E2M3 - VERY pleased with this one. Only problem is I used a little too much
       plasma, but E2M6 and E2M7 worked out ok. Don't normally do this well
       in an episode run. PB is 0:35 from scratch, but you don't need the
       blue armour on a single level run. This really IS the best place to
       get armour on an episode speedrun. Trust me. :)
E2M4 - Hmmmmm...a bit slow. I've done 0:45 in an episode run. PB from scratch
       is 0:42.
E2M5 - Damn, this was slow :(. Only really bad level in the demo. I was too
       low on health so had to be careful with the imps, then messed the
       running up a bit :(. I get 0:33 here quite often...that's my PB also.
E2M6 - Yeah. Got this done very very well again. Closing the door behind you
       going into the red key area is a very good tactic...you lose a couple
       of seconds but it puts the success rate on this level up to about 80%       
       instead of about 30% :)       
E2M7 - Got a pretty good one here! Good running up to the yellow key, bit
       slow afterwards. I much prefer to have more cells left here, to use
       on the demons that tend to queue up behind the door to the exit room,
       but it worked out just about OK.
E2M8 - took this one pretty carefully, seeing as time doesn't matter :).
       Toyed with doing it with shotgun only - which pretty much makes dying
       impossible - but decided against it in the end :)
