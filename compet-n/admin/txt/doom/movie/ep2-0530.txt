Description: To use Will Smith' words...."ups" (:

             errrr.....Panter TV proudly presents...35 secs improvement to
             Adam's time...(45 secs to S.W. & 7 min. 35 sec. to "Hunter" :)

             Sorry guys...this .lmp was not expected...it's my second attempt
             today..(ehm tonight :)...and I just played for fun...After Adam
             did his 6:05, I thought..."Hey I played every E2 map for Compet-N,
             let's give it a try"
             BIG MISTAKE...I got to e2m6...and had ABSOLUTELY no clue how to
             make this map...I Never got under 2mins..so I gave up trying..

             But this evening I had a nice chat with Adam...and...nothing to do
             after this...so I gave this a new try...

             Hey..everyone is invited to beat this .lmp...I'd really like to
             see the best time in here...I think I can push this up to 5:15..
             If someone wants to beat this..PLZ..also beat my "really whole
             episode time" of 6:16...(:
             
             btw: sorry about the very short (and after e2m5 very long)
             intermission screens...but, as I said..I didn't expect a good time
             (and I watched TV, while doing this one :)

            
             just some notes about the maps


  E2M4 (Deimos Lab):
Somewhat faster if the imps keep the door open ((:

  E2M5 (Command Center):
This is a route I found by accident...at my first attempts on this run (two
days ago) I got to this map with <10% health..hehe..try normal route (:
So I just walked around a bit and finally found my normal route again...
From there on I used this way because it's MUCH saver.

  E2M6 (Halls of Damned):
The most difficult part in this .lmp...Normally I'm lucky when I find my WAY
through this level, but this time the demons liked me and let me through (:

  E2M7 (Spawning Vats):
Suprisingly I got the yellow key in my first attempt...hmmm...

  E2M8 (Tower of Babel):
Ohhhh...we REALLY should involve the exm8 maps...it's just more fun
I thought e2m8 counts for the whole run...(that's one reason why I gave it a
try...Adams e2m8 looked a bit too bad :)


uhhh...now it's 1:19 am...I'll finish the stats tomorrow..(-:
