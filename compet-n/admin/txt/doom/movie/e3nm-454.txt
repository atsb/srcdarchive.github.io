  Description :-)
  
  OK, I know I said I won't try under 5:00...
  But I had to defend this run...
  IMO 4:45 is possible, wanna go for it Panter?

  E3M1 (Hell Keep):
    I never seem to be better than this...
  E3M2 (Slough of Despair):
    Oh I hate this! The lost souls drive me mad!
  E3M3 (Pandemonium):
    Very very good time. As you'd expect :)
  E3M4 (House of Pain):
    Bad time, still matching Panter. Should be better by 5 secs.
  E3M5 (Unholy Cathedral):
    The usual.
  E3M6 (Mt. Erebus):
    Quite satisfied with this.
  E3M7 (Gate to Limbo):
    Matching Panter again. 1:10 would be good.
  E3M8 (Dis):
    Huh... what a fight with 25% health!
