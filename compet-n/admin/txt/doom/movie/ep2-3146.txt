General note:
*************

There are two main problems when making runs like this. The first and most
obvious is to get 100% kills. Secondly its not always that easy to spend
the ammo correctly. I have not played this for many hours, just until I got
through with 100% of everything. IMO 28:27 (which is all compet-N times
for episode 2 summond), should be quite reachable - and beatable. But for now
I'll stick to this one...I mean, lets face it; Episode 2 sucks! And this is
6 mins and 37 secs faster then Williamson anyway...

E2M4 - Ok run. Almost forgot an imp.
E2M5 - Bad time and playing :(
E2M9 - Have no plan here, just try to hit target.
E2M6 - Awefull playing, lousy planning and dreadfull time.
