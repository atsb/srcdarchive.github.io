Description:  After doing e1ns for dang, I decided to try e2ns. Got this
              after a bit. Looks very sloppy in bits, but it's fun recording
              when speed isn't so much of an issue. Most of the time I went
              Rini's way.
         
        E2M1: Usual.
        E2M2: Ditto. 
        E2M3: Very ragged.
        E2M4: Hmmm...
        E2M5: This *is* slow, I had 3:02 in an earlier try...
        E2M9: Never any good here.
        E2M6: Most of the improvement over Rini came here (1:46)
        E2M7: No problem.
        E2M8: Didn't mean to kill Cybie this way, things just sorta
              happened...
