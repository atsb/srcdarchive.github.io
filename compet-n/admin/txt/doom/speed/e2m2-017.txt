  Description :-)

  Say, Simon, WHOSE level is this now?  <G>  I guess this needs the
  movement perfection of Steffen, Uwe or Anthe to be beaten. Bummer
  a wall run in the corridor only works in the wrong direction. ;-(

  I *did* include a .BAT with this, 'coz  S.;-)  takes good care of
  all the newbies out there. :-)  However, I'm convinced that every
  serious LMP'er (like Anthe and me) has a highly-sophisticated one
  of his own to handle this stuff - right? ;-)
