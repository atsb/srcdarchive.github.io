  Description :-)

  Sorry, um, Vincent, for stealing your "everlasting"
  point but this seemed possible so I gave it a go.
  Pretty hard, especially Pacifist style, the corridor
  just before the blue door is a nightmare.
  I wasn't very lucky with my tries, 25.02, 25.00, but
  who cares now.

  Of course, this is another DdQ-beater :)
