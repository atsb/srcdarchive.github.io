  Description :-)
 
  Well... this LMP has an interesting story...

  After doing the 0:29 on E2M3 it was natural that I thought of
  improving E2M4 to 0:41. I played and played and I knew it was possible.
  Then I made a very clear run and when I hit the exit switch, in that
  moment I knew I got it. And it was a 0:41 indeed, but as I checked with LMPC,
  I realized that it was a 41.00. I was very nervous because that run
  was nearly perfect.
  I played some more later but my times (especially the running part)
  didn't even get close to that 41.00 demo. I got a 41.71 meanwhile and
  I thought I'll upload that one so nobody gets tempted :-)
  Well when I hit the exit switch in this particular run, and saw the
  intermission screen I was the most surprised to spot 0:40. My first part
  obviously sucks and the end isn't good either. I checked with LMPC
  and it's a 40.97. I think that's my reward for not giving up :-)

  BTW: this beats DdQ by 2 seconds...
