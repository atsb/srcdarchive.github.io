  Description :

  In this recording I do really only the absolute minimum to survive.
  Even to get the green armour at the start is a too long action.
  I made some mistakes but a time much better than 1:39 seems impossible
  with all the imps and sergeants (-nomonsters : 1:13)
  The last scene is a bit dramatic because of my health level but the
  goal is speed not health.
