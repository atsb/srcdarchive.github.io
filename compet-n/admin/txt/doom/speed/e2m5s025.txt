  Description :-)

Using Adam W.'s route, but making it a tidge faster.  Little things that
make the difference:

Usually a far imp will fire at you, and if you can get the door open
to the demons quick enough it will hit one and they will infight, getting
out of your way.

Luck is needed to hit the switch quickly: a 2-shot demon kill and getting
in and out quickly.

I found a good way to go through the lost-soul part, though the turn-shot
takes some practice.

25 seconds, and definitely not optimal.
