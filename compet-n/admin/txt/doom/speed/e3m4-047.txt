  Description :-)

  I thought this new key-grab trick is really worth a new entry...
  Well it wasn't too easy, I cursed myself for doing that 0:49 demo,
  it was quite hard to beat. I managed to equal the DdQ time here, I
  think it's possible to beat it and do a 0:45...
  My 0:49 looked much better but I guess the new trick makes this one
  more interesting...
