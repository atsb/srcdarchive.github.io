Description:  

Aurikan's run was pretty good, but he was a bit tentative getting through
the imps in the switch room. I kept on getting 0:50s here for some reason,
then this came. I got outrageously lucky in the switch room, I missed the
barrel, then an enemy blew it up and somehow killed just about everything
in the room :). The ending is a bit messy, I have to shoot more monsters
than ideally you want to, but it's a pretty good time. Optimal...hm...0:43?
