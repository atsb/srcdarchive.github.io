  Description :-)

  Just thought of checking these ep. 4 levels, I don't think I'll do more in
  the next several weeks at least. This one was not too hard but also not
  easy, took me about 10 mins. Wade's 0:37 was good, the only part I thought
  I could improve was the bridgeswitch part. This lmp is not perfect, about
  0:33 should be possible... coolmp reports lastuse at 35.22 - again I am
  very close to being one second lower. This time I cannot blame my keyboard
  though ;-)

  The level is very nicely built and the open area part can get violent, but
  to get a good time there is just no time to kill these shotgunners - Keep
  moving and hope for the best!

  What is happening to me ? In the good old days I could easily write huge
  text files, and here I find myself with hardly 20 lines ;-)
