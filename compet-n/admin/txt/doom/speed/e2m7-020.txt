  Description :-)

  Wow... this was nice...
 
  Adam W. and me have "foreseen" this jump...
  but we were thinking that a rocket jump from a monster
  would be the solution. That one, of course insanely
  tough, so we agreed that there's a remote possibility
  in a possible DdQr run. But, none of us has realized
  the *real* way.
  So, all credits to Andy for making the discovery.

  My aim was to show that it's possible to finish this
  map without getting the shotgun. Rocket launcher (and luck)
  is enough to clear your way through. I didn't expect such
  a good time though and I'm fairly satisfied with this demo.
