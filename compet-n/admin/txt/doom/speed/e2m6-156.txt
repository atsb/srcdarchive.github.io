Description: George Bell mailed me, that he has to complete this level for
             his D1I. So I tried it a little bit in Nightmare!, but somehow
             failed. Then I looked for some cells, but there aren't any...

             Later I decided to just run through it [ on Ultra-Violence ].
             I got the time, searched in current.tab for the old one, and I
             was surprised how fast I was.
