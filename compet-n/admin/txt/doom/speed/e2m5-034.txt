  Description :-)

  Okay, here goes another cheap one ... I've done 0:33 as well, but
  that was with the -NoMonsters switch. I leave it up to Anthe, Uwe
  or Steffen to prove it can be done WITH monsters as well ...  ;-)

  I *did* include a .BAT with this, 'coz  S.;-)  takes good care of
  all the newbies out there. :-)  However, I'm convinced that every
  serious LMP'er (like Anthe and me) has a highly-sophisticated one
  of his own to handle this stuff - right? ;-)
