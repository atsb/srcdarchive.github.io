  Description :-)

  I just took another look at my E1M2-033.LMP and noticed it was rather
  pathetic. So I came up with a new plan for the level. I'm not good at
  descriptions (read my E1M2-033.TXT; it makes no sense), so just watch
  it. I just wanted to show a sub-30 second time was possible, since I
  had done it in 27 seconds on skill 3.
