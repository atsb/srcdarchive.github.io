  Description :-)

  Uh-oh... another DdQ time beaten... and yet another second closer to perfection here.
  I collected around the DdQ<->COMPET-N times and found some interesting facts...
  These are the maps which could be improved in DdQ:
  (not mentioning the maps where the DdQ time is slower because a specific item has to
  be gathered; and of course the U.G. ones)
  
  Map   DdQ   COMPET-N

  E1M4  0:22  0:16 (0:15 is possible combining the 2 tricks)
  E1M5  1:10  1:07
  E1M6  1:15  1:13
  E2M1  0:39  0:38
  E2M2  0:16  0:15
  E2M8  0:34  0:33 (0:32 is possible, see n2m8-032)
  E3M1  0:35  0:32
  E3M4  0:47  0:42
  E4M1  0:34  0:32
  E4M4  0:38  0:37
  E4M5  0:31  0:30
  
  Total time for DdQ: 19:41
  Total time for a possible DdQr: 19:13

  What am I trying to say? Let's go for DdQr? Probably not. It's just too much pain
  and suffering for half a minute. Refilming DdQ could be interesting though...

  DdQ is going to be 1 year old soon, and we managed to pull out quite an improvement
  over it in the last year... which was the *fifth* year of DOOM! Long live DOOM!
