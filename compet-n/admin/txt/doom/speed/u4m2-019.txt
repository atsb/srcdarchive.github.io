Comments: Kai said "Am I the ruler of U4M2 now ? YES !!!"

          HEHE...ruler ?...with 22 secs ? hahahaha very funny....(:

          Ok...sorry Kai...but this wasn't that hard...took me just one hour.
          The main reason for this ultrafast time, is a little improvement
          to your route in the beginning. Why do you shot the deamon ?...
          Just kill one Imp and it is no problem to run past him........ok I
          had some luck with the caco's, too. (:
