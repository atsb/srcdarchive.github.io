Description: I hate those "unbeatable" records like 0:12
             Have played the level for 100/100 (1:13), and now I think
             this record is mine. Has anybody got a .LMP with less
             keys or less tries ?
             Besides: Look at the time I recorded it ;-)

Doom bugs are ugly, but if they help...
