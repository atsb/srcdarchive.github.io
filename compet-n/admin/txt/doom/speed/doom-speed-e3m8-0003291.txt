===================================
Description: Gah, 2 seconds (sort of) beside Seldo's time, but funny enough, not shooting rockets behind got me a
better time than my last attempts, then again, might be RNG damage and some slightly better straferunning that
helped, otherwise, bah, guess I am not having the luck on me. I guess it can be worse, the time isn't so bad, but
it can be much better even if by a few seconds.
