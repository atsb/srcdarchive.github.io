  Description:

  One of the hardest levels I ever had to record.  I had seen Steffen's
  Ep.4 run and I was inspired to beat 1:22. I tried running it his
  pattern and couldn't get even close to his time.  I consider Steffen
  to be the world's best DooMer, but he got lucky the way the monsters
  lined up. I tried every conceivable pattern and weapon combination
  and this one was the most effective for setting a record time.
