Description: hmmmmm.....After all these D2Speed lmps, I wanted to do something
             new....I watched D2NM and 100/100 recordings, but I don't like
             these categories (especially 100/100 is really boring)
             Well..the only thing I really like is speedrunning...So why not
             record some D1 .lmps.

             This one was very easy...took me about 20 mins.
