  I know it's not a record and someone has already done :10 in this level,
  but it's not too easy (though it was much easier than I expected), and
  since I found no "b" for this one I did it myself. It seems STRAFE ON
  doesn't generate SL/SR50 with the keyboard, only the mouse.

[  Admin. Note ;-)  Speed ON, Strafe ON and Turning *DOES* give SL/SR 50
   with a mouse OR a keyboard... but if you use separate strafe left and
   right keys you are [ artificially ] limited to a SL/SR of "just" 40 !
