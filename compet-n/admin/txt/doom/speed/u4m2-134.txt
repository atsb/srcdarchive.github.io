Comments: Have seen not only Steffen's 30NM6520, but his episode runs too.

          Thought I should set a first record for this level. Feel free to
          improve it. The jump is _NOT_ easy, because you have to make it
          diagonal. Watch Steffens EP4-0848, if you wanna know how it could
          be made in 53 seconds.

          These EP?-???? from Steffen are the only ones, where you can see
          him playing UltraViolence (except for a few "speed" entries?). I
          never thought he would be that fast because his NightMare .LMP's
          most of the time look rather slow. But if it is necessary...
