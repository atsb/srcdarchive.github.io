Description: When Adam asked about the ep4nm I thought a bit about a safe
             route through this one..hmm..couldn't find any...but I noticed a
             new route that safes some time..
             W/o RL...hmm..and w/o Green Armour (Well, I wanted to get it :).
             This is my first successful attempt with that route (problem was
             to get the red key :)
