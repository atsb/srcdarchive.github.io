  Description :-)

  Berzerk-only recording - who needs a shotgun, anyway? ;-) Already
  got a 1:12 version done a couple of weeks ago,  but it was rather
  obvious that it could be done faster. Still, this .LMP looks like
  another 1 or 2 seconds could be shaved off - but you'll need tons
  and tons of patience to do it, be warned!  I died about a million
  times in the red key room,  and that's actually *NOT* too much of
  an exaggeration ... ;-( or ;-) - you decide!

  [ .BAT stuff snipped for briefness - it was getting old anyway! ]
