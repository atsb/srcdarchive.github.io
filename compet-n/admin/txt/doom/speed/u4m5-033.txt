  Description :-)

  I started this while trying to do this level in Nightmare. Quickly I gave
  up about the Nightmare idea but on UV I thought I could do it pretty
  quickly.

  0:34 - It was quite easy to do this - COOLMP reports lastuse at 34.17!!!
  Very close to 33 seconds - meaning it will also be quite easy to get 0:33.
  0:33 - Indeed! It was quite easy to do it...

  I think a 0:31 or even 0:30 is possible using this route.
