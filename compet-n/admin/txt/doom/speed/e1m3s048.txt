Description:  
             I'm not faster than Anders, but I do have a couple of tricks
             up my sleeve.

             Tricks to make it go faster:
             The 2nd room barrel trick, I find more enemies get killed
             if you run through, turn and shoot the barrel you passed,
             then turn and shoot the barrel in the alcove.  I actually
             tend to shoot the shotgunner in-between because he hurts you
             pretty bad, it's hard to do a complete 180 in one shotgun
             reload, and because it allows the imps to gather around the
             barrel more.

             Revised ending, which I screwed up anyway.  Ideally, hit the
             center/right barrel, and go through the trail of guts, shoot
             the blocking imp and exit.

             Close enough.  Anders, I expect at least a :45 on this.
