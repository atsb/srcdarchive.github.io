 A very funny map, and so ingeniously built. Love it. Time is better than
 Steffen's (/me is bowing all the time ;-) in the famous Ep4 run, although
 being unequipped. After trying a few times i got the right timing, i play
 the start a bit slower than possible, therefore the cacos don't cross my
 way when I do the 'Steffen jump'. I think here it's not too useful to have
 a separate entry for the secret exit, since time would differ only by 1 or
 2 seconds. but /me is not /admin ;-) Room for improvements ? Of course !
