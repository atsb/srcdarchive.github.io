===================================
Description:

I boldly changed the use of rockets from the previous record. 
First of all, I thought it was not effective to use one rocket 
for destroying a barrel from an outside area where there was 
a soul sphere. Next, I thought a few rockets should be used 
in a computer room, then I altered the number of rockets for use  
between a computer room and a circular room after yellow key's 
door little by little, but wasting a few seconds for changing 
weapons was not ignorable. As a result, I used the most of the 
rockets in the computer room. It was probably more effective 
than the previous one. Trying various routes was pretty interesting. 

The circular room considerably depended on luck. The elevator's 
timing did not match easily when I escaped from the room even if 
I cleared enemies quickly. One or two enemies also were left 
frequently and 100 kills were missed many times.
