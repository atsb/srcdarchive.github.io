  Description :-)

  Hmmm, this came kinda easy... 40 minutes altogether.
  BTW, this route (trademark of Ilya) is faster than the old one...
  no need to get through the pigs.
  I used no strafe50 to get the key... I think it's easier this way.
  (Hi Panter!)
  
  Yes, and I continued my series of "equalling a DdQ run".

  I think this is a nice way to get my 50th COMPET-N point.

  PS. Exact time very low (25.45) but don't even think of beating this! 
  PS2. n3m5-025... Panter?
