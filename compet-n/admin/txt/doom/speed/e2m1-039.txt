  Description:

  This is the start of my new episode run, ep2-0428. It was recorded
  normally (in ep2-0428, I connected lmps only across levels, not within
  levels - see doomruns.txt in ep2-0428.zip for more information) so I thought
  I can also upload it as a COMPET-N entry. I was surprised to find the old
  best was Daniel's 0:40 (correct me if that's not correct), I used to find
  his demos unbeatable, I guess all that Quaking improved my Doom skills as
  well.
