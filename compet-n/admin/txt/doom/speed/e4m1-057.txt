  A nice level for recording, its not too long but with lots of action.
  I think the best time should be about 0:50 with this route, w/o
  the rocket launcher I cannot say since I never reached the exit alive.
  I still do way too much in this recording and have rather bad luck in
  the end. I also recorded a 0:58 version with a much faster end, so...
  Try to improve the time...
