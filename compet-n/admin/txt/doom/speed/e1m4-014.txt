  Description :-)

  Yeah... similar to the E4M3 trick by Ralf discovered earlier...
  I got inspired and got this one.
  Again, the funky running style comes because my right strafe
  button is "hacked" to doing strafe50... so I can only do left-side
  straferunning...

  This 0:14 wasn't easy but I know 0:13 is possible since I made
  it with -nomonsters.
