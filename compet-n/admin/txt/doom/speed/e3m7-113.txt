  Description:  Well, that recording is an accident. I just tried to beat
                Andy Badorek's pacifist record. Yes, I made it, and if you
                remove Uwe's 1:08 which looks unbeatable w/o cheating -
                then this recording is the fastest so far.
                It does not look good at all, and surely will be beaten
                quickly. Most annoying is that I loose one second because
                I do not hit the exit with the first try :((((((
                At least it is played with "pacifist style".
