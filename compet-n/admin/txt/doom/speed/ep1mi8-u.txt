  Description:

  Motivation:
   My COMPET-N points decrease more and more. I think it's time to
   stop this trend.

  Level choosing:
   Unfortunately I didn't beat a "non-german-speaking" player (I beat
   Thomas Zajic actually (by 14 sec)) but I really had to increase my own
   points to keep ahead of Steffen, who did his final victory (32 levels
   DOOM ][ in NightMare!). Furthermore I like the "Knee deep in the dead"
   levels best.

  Time calculation:
   I took the time (1:25) out of the .LS file, created with my well known
   LMPC tool. The last action game tic was 2984 (1min 25.25sec).

  The recording itself:
   I was very lucky, that I never had to run around the level for more
   ammunition. One of the Spectres almost killed the second Baron of Hell.
   This gave me at least 10 seconds. Thank you again from this point.
