  Description :-)

  A new jump to make this level a little more interesting.
  
  I searched around for this jump but I haven't found it
  anywhere else so I hope it's right if I call it new.

  The 2 second improvement seems little, but anyway it's
  not that bad without any plasma. And it's 3 seconds
  faster than DdQ.

  I expect a much better time in a possible DdQr.
