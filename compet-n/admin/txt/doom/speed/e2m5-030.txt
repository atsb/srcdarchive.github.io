  Description :-)

  I think SataniC's time (00:33) was not very much more than a lame
  attempt at a lousy joke. <GGGG> ;-) Hey, SataniC! -  Fast enough,
  NOW? Mmmwwwwwuuaaahhhaahhhahhhahhhahhaahaaaa!!! (slow fadeout :-)

  I *did* include a .BAT with this, 'coz  S.;-)  takes good care of
  all the newbies out there. :-)  However, I'm convinced that every
  serious LMPer (like Anthe and me) has a high-sophisticated one of
  his own to handle this stuff - right? ;-)
