Description: hmmmmm.....I had a 0:36 ten days ago, but then Yonatan asked me
             to do it again for a ddq-u4-run....2 seconds faster and with a RL 
             in the end...I think thats enough for now.
             I must be crazy to beat my own entries, so I won't go for a 0:33
             although it is possible...
