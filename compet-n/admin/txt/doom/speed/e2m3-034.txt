Description: I had to roll up my sleves and go to work, after I submitted
             a time of :40 only to have it topped before it could be taken
             out of lmps/incoming. It may be a faster possible way "dunno".
             This might be as good as it gets, at least for me that is.


PS. Thanks to the previous author for showing me a better way, and also,
    a very good lmp.
