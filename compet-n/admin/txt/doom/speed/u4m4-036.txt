  Description :-)

  All right, I can make 2 jumps in one day, here's another one :-)
  Actually there are 2 jumps here (identical to each other, watch
  u4m4n035.lmp), both of them save 0.5 second. I left the second
  one because it's blocked by the imps. However it's possible, I had
  1-2 successful attempts in my tries. You can guess how much work
  I did from the difference in the timestamps of the 2 LMPs.

  Anders' time was 37.77, I made up 0.5 second by running, and 0.5
  second by the jump, that gave me 36.77. So someone could end up
  with 0:35 with both jumps done and even better running than me.

  This beats DOOM Done Quick by 2 seconds.
