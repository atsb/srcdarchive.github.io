Description : I had a 32 after 10 mins, but after these easy lmps I wanted to
              push it a bit more...This 31 looks really great for this map.
              It should be possible to improve it up to 30 (maybe it is faster
              to do this w/o Plasma, but it's a lot harder to pass the two
              LostSouls then)
