  Description :-)
 
  This was bitch tough again, needed 300 tries to succeed. Normally this route
  has only a few monsters to fight with, but it has many annoying situations.
  I dunno if others had problems with this, but that f****** cacodemon after
  the teleport caused me much pain, just couldn't get past it.

  The finishing time is great... I always wanted to finish something in exactly
  forty-two seconds :)

  Another of DdQ equalled...
