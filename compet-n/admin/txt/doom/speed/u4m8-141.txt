Description: Im not sure what the record is for this - then again Ive never
             recorded a fast demo before this one. You can leave the chain
             gun. It helps but its not necessary. Killing most of the troop-
             ers at the start with well placed rockets is a must. Basically
             from there on, the less stuff you leave in the pit saves time, 
             and good manouvering will get you to the end easily.
