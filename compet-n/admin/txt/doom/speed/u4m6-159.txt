  Description:  Ugly lmp, though it shows a route-improvement since
                Steffen "Mini" Udlufts 2:48...I wasted a BFG right
                before exiting, looks really lame- I know.
                This only required very few tries, but I'll defend it if
                someone els tries to get it. Sorry "Mini", but this is my
                favourite map too ;)
