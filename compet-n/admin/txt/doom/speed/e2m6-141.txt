  Description : This is the enhancement of my previous (2:35) submission.
                Here I shave off almost a minute. The basic idea, however,
                is the same: keep the Barons unalerted, so that you
                can exit safely. I doubt that this time can be reduced
                significantly - only, maybe, about 5-6 seconds. Anyway,
                the "theoretical" limit of this level is around 1:20
                (when strafe-running whole level with -nomonsters) :-)
