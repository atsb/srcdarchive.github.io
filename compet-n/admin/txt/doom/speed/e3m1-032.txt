Description: Hmmm...Baum was here (:
             And he was REALLY proud of his .lmps...I hated this "Damn I'm
             good..."-sentences, and so I did this while he was watching/crying
             (:

             Hey Adam...let's keep that good teamworking in deleting Baum's 
             .lmps (:
