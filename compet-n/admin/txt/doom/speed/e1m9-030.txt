Dead on :). I changed Adam H's routes a little here...went through the yellow
key room faster, and in the red key room i didn't shoot the middle barrel
or the barrels in front of the switches. Apart from this, you need a LOT of
luck with sergeants on this level, basically. I had 0:31 for a long time,
screwed up about 5 0:30s before I finally hit this one. time is 0:30.60.
It's quite a scrappy demo and _looks_ easy to improve...but trust me, 0:29
would be hard as hell :)
