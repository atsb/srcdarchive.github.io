  Description :-)

  Sorry Rudy for clearing out your first demo this fast, but as you wrote,
  it was improvable, so I improved it... A little closer to perfection...
  
  Excellent trick from Rudy BTW, I really have to thank him for that.
  I would have never come up with this route...

  I think 0:15 is possible with Yonatan's trick, however two tricks combined
  always mean trouble... I don't care about this point too much, because I'd
  love to see 0:15 done here... Anyone?

  Oh yes... and this one is pacifist as well...
