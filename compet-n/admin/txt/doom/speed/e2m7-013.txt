  Description :)

  Credis to Vile for the trick. My first succesful jump was
  without using a shotgun ... I killed sergeant but I missed
  shotgun :P then I simply managed my first jump with pistol

  I decided to keep trying the trick with pistol and it was
  kinda confusing how I'll do the jump with pistol, you can
  push imps away while building the glide or kill them, either way
  is hard because while building up the st50 againt the monster
  you usually don't hit him with pistol cause of your aim direction.
  And turning while shooting won't build enough speed. Also it
  should be possible to do the glide pacifist style, it's easier
  with the demon cause building speed with him isn't as 'sticky'
  as the imp which requires you to shoot him unless you make
  him infight with the demon or maybe some insane luck

  About the run, well I'm quite happy with time and demo look
  Hope you like it and see ya next time !
