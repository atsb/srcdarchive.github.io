Description: I had another idea of cheating, but GoDFatheR made it this way.
             Don't know why he lowered the hidden shell boxes and lost time
             there. So I could improve it by a single second.

             I'm rather sorry that my way is slower (just 2 secs.) but only
             because the stairs raise so slooow. Thanks to Steffen, who has
             completed now the D2S and maybe had discovered this trick.
