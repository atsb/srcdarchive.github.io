  Description :-)

  This is the .LMP  I had done before Kai mentioned the possibility
  of *jumping* (Yup, that read *jumping*!!! Get my E2M2j016.ZIP for
  details :-) to the exit door to me. Here, I modified Wade's route
  a bit -  A) slightly better stop-go pattern through the crushers,
  B) going back the crusher way is not a good idea  (makes you wait
  too long), and  C) you don't want to punch the imps while waiting
  for the stairs to raise (doesn't matter if you take Wade's way to
  the red door, feel free to try it with my route though! ;-)

  [ .BAT stuff snipped for briefness - it was getting old anyway! ]
