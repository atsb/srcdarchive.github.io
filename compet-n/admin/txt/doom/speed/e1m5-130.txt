  Description :-)

  Well the time itself is very good, but if you watch the .LMP
  you'll see that I still make some mistakes. Anyway the start
  of the level is too good - never got it again this way. When
  I started playing for the COMPET-N (and the DHT5) the former
  record lmp from Uwe G. was like a dream for me. Uwe looks so
  perfect. The first, I took from him, was E1M3, the second is
  is this one E1M5 and the last should and will be E1M7.
