  Description :-)

  40s?????
  Are you kidding Panter?
  That's too slow for me...
  
  This is a slightly improved route of Panter's. I pick up just as many ammo
  as I need.

  If you wanna strike back, Panter, you'll probably need more luck than I had,
  with the damage you inflict and with the monsters teaming up with you.
  I don't think this time can be improved by much, let's say 0:36 is possible.

  Oh, and don't worry about secrets in your maxkills demo, Panter. There are
  none :)
