  Description :-)

  Sorry Matthias that I beat your first COMPET-N demo, but as you said, under
  1 minute is possible. A huge thanx to Matthias for the jump-trick, I wouldn't
  have found that out myself.

  The route is modified from my last attempt, I leave the first baron sooner
  (exactly after using 50 bullets). I still don't know if blowing the barrels
  really helps, but it definately makes things easier.
  You gotta have luck with the barons (how they walk, how they attack the
  spectres) and the spectres (how they block your aim, how they attack the
  barons) and so on.

  I'm quite satisfied with this demo as a whole, and of course I'm happy to
  beat the 1 minute barrier.
