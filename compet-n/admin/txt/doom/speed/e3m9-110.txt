  Description :-)

Beats Adam H by one lousy second. I got a dream run here, didn't have to kill
the last pinky and got through the imps with 4 shots...then one bastard caco
screwed me up in the exit room. Grrr. Could've been 1:09. Human optimal 1:08
or 1:07, IMO...but I have a feeling this would be one of those TAS runs which
goes a long way down for no obvious reason, if it was made...maybe 1:04.
