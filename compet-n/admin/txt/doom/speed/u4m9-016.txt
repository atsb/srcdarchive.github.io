  I'll begin by saying that this is a very bad LMP. "Why then," you ask, "is
  it an improvement?" Well, the answer is that I use a new much better route
  to finish the level. (Watch it and see!) I think it can be done about 0:11
  using this route without all the stupid things I did (continuing the jump,
  getting stuck at the cacodemon, delaying at the end, delaying at the door,
  running straight instead of diagonal etc.). Just wanted to show I can find
  jumps too!

  I've just finished the Quake Shareware the second time on the "Hard"
  skill. When will Quake get it's place in the COMPET-N?
