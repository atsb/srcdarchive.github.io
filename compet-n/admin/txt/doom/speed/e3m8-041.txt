                Yes, I guess there will be three new entries tomorrow with
                a better route: this is one of them ;-)

                > uhh..I moved till the very end of course...

                Yes, of course one MUST move till the very end,
                otherwise it's bloody cheating.

                Besides me beating "Panther" there are two interesting
                things in that recording:
                1) I start moving in the first gametic -
                   yes, it is very easy to do this with keyboard.
                2) I am lucky enough to get all three monsters fighting
                   the spider. Especially a scratching baron can help a lot.

                Btw:
                Thomas don't mind the few strafe50 statements, they
                don't help me anything, it's just my style.

                ... and if someone will beat me by !SEVEN! seconds again
                (as Esko did with e3m7-105) I will cry and stop DOOMing :~(
                ;-)

           PS:  Maybe Patrick Martin should go for speed in this map,
                Spider Masterminds tend to die immedetially
                when they see HIM coming >8-o
