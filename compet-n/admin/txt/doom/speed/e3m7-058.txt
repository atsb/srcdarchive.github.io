  Description :-)

  Nice jump by Andy.. all credits to him.

  I chose not doing the back-jump at the yellow key and
  also sticking to the old way at the yellow door.
  If one manages both and does a fair running, I'd say
  he could end up with a 0:56.
  
  I had an idea of a goodbye-yellow-key route but the
  jump without the exit bridge up seems a bit far. After
  refreshing my geometry skills, I found out that it's
  a 257 unit jump... not very likely even with a shotgun
  boost.

  I'm very happy that the 1 minute barrier is finally down,
  and that it was my honor to do it.

  This is a pacifist entry as well...
