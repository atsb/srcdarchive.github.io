  Description

  Wow ALOT of luck right here. I do some very risky stuff 
  like trapping myself in the Baron box. I grab the megasphere
  because theres no way I could survive without it by playing
  like I did. The demon in the begining gets in my way and
  costs me some time. Improvable most likely.
  
  It looks a little bit sloppy at parts, but I am not concerned with looks.
