  Description :-)

  OH YEAH, how sweet was to get this time!
  
  I was forced to play this map again after Jon beat my 0:47 run. Since this map has my only
  keytrick, I was eager to get it back. I did 0:44 after 2 hours of play, but I knew
  it had a mistake, so I carried on, playing for 0:43. That didn't come after another 2
  hours, so I rested for a day. Some other 0:44's came later (total of four I have),
  but no 0:43. Then I had this wonderful run. I was actually slower than usual in the
  first 30 seconds, but the last part went great. Especially because the exiting time
  is 42.97, I think that was my reward for this long long playing.
  I don't know what's the optimum time, you never know...
  What else, it's great to beat DDQ by *five* seconds!

  Sorry for stealing your first point Jonathan, but this map is special for me and I
  won't let anyone touch it... We never told COMPET-N was easy anyway ;))
