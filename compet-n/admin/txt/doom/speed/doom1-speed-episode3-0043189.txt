E3M8 comparison is not relevant. E3M1-E3M7 time is improved by 3 seconds.

Description: 
I completed episode three back in 2005 and wrote i would give this one another shot if anyone managed to improve the time so here it is!!!



E3M1: This map is very frustrating and not exactly ideal to speedrun through.  My best time is 32 but i usually end up with 33-35.  I accepted that my run would
already be 3-5 seconds slower than Zero-Master's time because my skills on this map are not so good :) 

E3M2: Nice map to speedrun on although the lost souls near the exit may sometimes block you.  Best time here is a high 14 but it's quite difficult to get


E3M3: It's 50/50 if you get blocked by monsters at the mega armor area, and it definitly sucks if you do.  The majority of my attempts have ended on this map because i pretty much have to get a good time here to compensate for E3M1.  I copy zero-master at the end here and switch to a different weapon in preperation for the next map.
 
E3M4:  The hardest thing about this map is the keygrab through the wall.  You can attempt to grab the key twice and still manage 42 seconds.  I managed to grab the key
on the first try but i still got 42 :/ 

E3M5: 26s is not the best time but it's decent i guess

E3M6: 25s would be ideal here but that requires alot of luck depending on how well you manuever/clear the monsters in the bluekey room

E3M7:I get blocked by a pig here and lost a second.. on well


E3M8: :O


Enjoy!
