Description: Anthes 01:08 is IMO his best single map uv-run for Doom. Yonatan
             had 01:10 in DDQ. So I'm not ashamed with this 1 sec improvement,
             although its clearly an lmp full of mistakes.
             Took me about an hour to make. Now I have to study for one big,
             sucking MS Access-test :(
