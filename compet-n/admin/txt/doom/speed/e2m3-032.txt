Description: This .lmp looks really easy, with many mistakes...But it was a 
             REALLY hard one...especially the end is pure luck (take a look at
             the time (: )
             I slightly changed the route and the order of the used weapons.
             Consequently a 31 is possible...hmmmmmm...ok...maybe it isn't
             possible using this route (:
