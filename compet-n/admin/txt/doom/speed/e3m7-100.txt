  Description :-)

Add one more to the limbo jump series.  I'm poor at speedrunning so
I expect that this level will max out somewhere in the mid/lower 50s.
The new jump is quite fiendish; it is somewhat easy to do, but gets
extremely hard to do coming from the teleport.  It's actually a breeze
if done from the yellow-key stage, and it's downright easy if you raise
the yellow-key-gap bridge
I get a helpful kick from the shotgunner, but I have done it this
method in nomonsters as well, it's just even harder.

Hmm that makes what 3 jump tricks in one day?  (And 2 with rockets!)

BTW this beats DDQ by 1s.
