Description: 
My first Ultimate Doom demo!

The glide on this map is a guideless north directed glide.
I know out how to do these types of glides so I figured I would give this map a try.

Very very difficult to get this glide quickly, you need to get the right 
position, angle and not go to far past the gap and in a very short time.
This is also true for any type of glide, except here going past the gap is
very likely to occur if you aren't very precise of when to stop moving forward
and applying vertical mouse movement.

With better movement and quicker glide 0:32 is possible, but that
would take an insane amount of effort.
