  This .lmp is quite terrible - I do many mistakes and I miss like hell,
  but using this route it's tough to survive, and the result - yet another
  1-second improvement. I saw the old record (e3m6-037) and I thought that
  there is absolutely no need to take the invulnerability since it takes
  so long. You can live with a shotgun and a berserk and, for competition
  .lmps, you have to sacrifice health for time many times.
