Description: Okay, this is now very hard to beat. Because my local mirror at
	     home is updated only every year, I thought first the record is
	     still Yonatans 38 seconds. After not quite an hour of play I got
	     a 0:36, and as I checked history.log I realized the Adam Hegyi
	     had already played the same time. But I knew that 35 seconds are
	     possible, because the 36 still had flaws, but I had to play for
	     some hours to get this. Because I decide for speed or 100/100
	     at the door, if I can pass the Cacos or not, I got also a 1:09
	     100/100 meanwhile :) After 2 hours of play with no success I
	     changed my tactics at the last Imps. When you retire after the
	     first shot for a few moments, you'll need at least 50% health
	     less, the success rate to reach the exit increase therefore to
	     two out of three.
	     Well, this LMP still has flaws, but it's also a very high 0:35
	     (I think 2 gametics below 0:36), that's why I don't think it can
	     be improved without days of recording. It's not impossible, I've
	     got an LMP where I'm almost one second faster at the Imp's door
	     (available on my page), maybe you can save also one shot for the
	     Imps too. That would be a 34 then, but because it took me a long
	     time to get this it's not very likely to be finished ever.
