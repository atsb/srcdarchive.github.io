Description:

Yonatan: I'll begin by saying that this is a very bad LMP.
Panter : hmmmm I wouldn't say "very bad" because the route is fantastic...
         but your time (0:16) wasn't that good.

Yonatan: I think it can be done about 0:11 using this route
Panter : jepp...I think this will be the best time possible (extremly hard)

Yonatan: Just wanted to show I can find jumps too!
Panter : hehe...you did....great jump


and finally I can join Yonatan by saying:
"Please e-mail me and give me some feedback! I'd love to hear it!" (:
