  Description:

  I did this level long ago but Anthe forced me to repeat it...

  In this recording are only two really new elements:

  1. I take the shotgun from the second and not from the first sergeant.

  2. I don't shoot in the room with the two lowering pillars because this
  would wake up the monsters on the way back. I use the counter-clockwise
  direction because of a broken symmetry in the monsters behind the hidden
  doors: all the right ones look to the center (to me) but only 3 out of 8
  on the left side look to the center - the other 5 look to the wall. The
  right ones can see me anyway (I pass there as the doors open) but the
  left ones are still inactive until my first (barrel) shot. They wake up
  and have to turn around. This helps me to leave this disgusting room.

  In the next phase I use only 5 rockets. This gives me the opportunity to
  kill one of the demons in the last room with a rocket.
