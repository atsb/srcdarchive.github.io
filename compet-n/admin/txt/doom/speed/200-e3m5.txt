Comments: After my 100-r3m5 and 100-n3m5 entries I wondered if a 200-*3m5
          would be possible. I was looking at the map (with most maps I
          only know the survival routes, not the extras) and I found a
          blue soul sphere which was fairly easy to get to. So this LMP
          was born.
