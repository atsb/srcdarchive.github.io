  Description :-)

  Hi, that's me again, walkin' Easy Street ...  ie., gathering some
  easy entries to compensate the Big Time Level Theft that  SataniC
  MechaniC made himself guilty of! ;-)

  I *did* include a .BAT with this, 'coz  S.;-)  takes good care of
  all the newbies out there. :-)  However, I'm convinced that every
  serious LMP'er (like Anthe and me) has a highly-sophisticated one
  of his own to handle this stuff - right? ;-)
