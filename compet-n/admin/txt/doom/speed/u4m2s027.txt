Comments: It's now my 6th or 7th 0:27 but this has got the best
          time (27.28). I wonder what a built one would be like.
          I just don't think I can make THE jump there, because
          the Cacos haven't moved away soon enough. It's not a
          good map for /built. Apart from that you don't have to
          jump down to the imps but can directly jump into the
          teleporter. The problem is that you have to cross one
          of the stair-sided lines, the other two aren't tele-
          porting lines :(

          How about some deathmatches on this map?
