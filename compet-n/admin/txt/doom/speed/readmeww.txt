[ Liar ! ]

    After some conversation with the _man_ Steffen Winterfeldt...

[ More lies (Steffen doesn't take "fan mail") - Snipped ]

 Map01 -- Entryway

[ Etc (Usually reflecting Steffen's comments) - Snipped ]

 Map05 -- The Waste Tunnels
    I ignore the second soul sphere. I get the plasma gun here simply because
it makes life so much easier.

[ Nope - Getting it in 06 is even more of a bitch ( ? ;-) ]

 Map06 -- The Crusher
                                                  ... However, the exit jump
has got to go... it's far too wimpy and insulting for this kind of LMP.

[ YM "not very convincing" HTH ;-) ]

 Map08 -- Tricks and Traps
    Another level I've practised over and over again. And again, again, and,
now I can do it no problem. The backpacks were never worth the trouble of all
the demons swarming. The BFG is right there.

[ That's why it's D2I EASY - you don't even NEED a weapon ]

 Map09 -- The Pit
                                                                     ... I
wasn't really worried about ending it well because of the megasphere at the
end, but I forgot to pick it up on the way out. Oh well, I still ended well.

[ "megasphere at the end" of 09 ? Where ? Maybe that's why "you forgot" ]

 Map12 -- The Factory
    There was never anything difficult about this level, except of course the
end. With accurate timing, the cacodemons really don't pose a threat.

[ Nope - it's the final room that is THE killer ]

 Map13 -- Downtown
    This level even with the right strategy is a pain in the ass. But if you
keep your cool everything works okay. The new method of jumping towards the
blue door instead of getting up close and personal with the reverents seems to
be the most effective method yet. You should always end 200/200.

[ Even Steffen got this wrong... This level is D2I EASY even starting from
  scratch - Once you've got a route you can just fly through - Ah, well it
  SHOULD have been D2I EASY except *I* didn't realise this at the time ;-) ]

 Map15 -- Industrial Zone
    Now I don't waste time getting the yellow key the second time I teleport
to the BFG room. This may make it easier, but this map is easy enough for me
not to worry about such trivial things. And, yes, I go for the secret exit
simply because I wanted to finish every last level...

[ Oh yeah ? Secret Exit = EASY ! Normal Exit = Impossible !!! ]

 Map31 -- Wolfenstein
[ & ] Map32 -- Grosse
    Not much to say, anyone can do it. Don't forget to stock up on ammo while
you're here. I didn't get the blur sphere... I didn't need it.

[ You NEED the ammo from both of these EASY levels for the next ]

 Map20 -- Gotcha!
    If it wasn't for this route, this level would be impossible. But this
route makes it quite bearable (though the ending is usually a close call).

[ This is where Billy-boy is Sssooo WRONG... If you/anyone looked at this
  level for more than 0 minutes you would soon realise that with all the
  health/armour/weapons and not much in your way - and with a well chosen
  route - this level is TOO EASY ! And since it was Me who put this into
  the DHT Incubus base set, I think I'm qualified to say. ;-)  As for the
  end being a close call: nope - from 100% plus health and the next level
  being "the hospital", you can quite easily rush through it with plasma. ]

[ The rest of this was garbage too - Snipped, apart from the jokes ]


 Map21 -- Nirvana
    I've discovered some new tricks that make this level much easier. Like the
fact that you don't need the blue key. So don't think I'm odd for the almost
suicidal approach I take at the end; I finish with 200/200. You absolutely
have to...

 Map22 -- The Catacombs
    I used to hate American McGee for Map17. Now I hate him for Map22. This is
where I got shredded last time out. Now, careful strategy and a lot of luck
are all you need. This level will break your spirit about DOOM2-NM.

 Map25 -- Bloodfalls
    Nice music, nice layout. This level is not too difficult, but respawning
becomes a serious problem about two mintutes into the level. Solution: make
sure you finish in under two minutes. ;-)

 Map28 -- The Spirit World
    Nice music... this level has a great look and feel. And it's easy too. You
make think I'm pulling your chain about maps 27 and 28, but they're real easy.
If 5 invunerabilities aren't enough for you...

 Map29 -- The Living End
    Worse than Map17, not as bad as Map22. Still, this level is _extremely_
difficult. I have to use Steffen Winterfeldt's method since that's the only
one that will work.

 Map30 -- Icon Of Sin
    *sigh* There, I made it. Don't worry about finishing Map29 with much
health as there is a beautiful megashere waiting for you upon your arrival. I
had alittle fun with this level, as one should after this feat. It's best if
you hit the brain twice your first use of the lift, since things get hairy
after that. I let the story record as usual, but I left none of the ending
sequence in as no more use hits gets registered from that point in the LMP.
Besides, all you do it sit there and bang your spacebar to kill the creatures.
Where's the fun in that? *sick grin*
