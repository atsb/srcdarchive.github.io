Description: It's still hard even if you take out all the sergeants. I get
             the shotgun faster and I don't collect the medkit. I had done
             this before, but had 10% less health and 5 seconds more after
             doing it, so I thought I would leave it where it is. I didn't
             shoot at the Imp-barrel first, but did that later. I can play
             it nearly autmatically now, never release the fire button til
             the barrel for the pig. Quite nice .LMP in less than 1:00 ;-)
             Haven't played for too long to get the time (1.5 hours?), but
             it was only the 2nd or 3rd try I reached the exit.
