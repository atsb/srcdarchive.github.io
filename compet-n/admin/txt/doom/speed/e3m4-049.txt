  Description :-)

  So, Panter improved Yonatan's time by 4 secs, now I improved Panter's
  just by the same. I didn't improve the route by much, I pick up only 1
  rocket at the start.

  > This 53s. will be extreme hard to beat..but it is possible.

  Hmmm... I did 0:51 after 10 mins... I nearly uploaded it, but I said
  to myself: "Why let Panter do under 0:50 first?" :)
  So I decided to play more... and yes, 0:49 came very hard. I played
  nearly 3 hours for this... The LMP looks great, I'm quite satisfied with
  it.

  Still, I'd say 0:48 or even 0:47 is possible.
