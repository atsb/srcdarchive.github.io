  Description :-)

  During an e-mail discussion on how to remove (or at least weaken)
  "some guy from the US" ;-), who recently started taking over DooM
  entries quietly but continuously [ Hi, Wade! :-) ], Kai mentioned
  that it was possible to do E2M2 without any key, utilizing a jump
  that he discovered together with Dasa.

  Soooo ... hint taken, thanx, -recorded, done! :-) Full credits to
  Kai and Dasa for always finding a trick to finish a level the way
  it was definitely *NOT* meant to be done! <GGG> ;-)  Meanwhile, I
  tend to believe that if DooM was the  "Jump & Run"  type of game,
  Kai's position in the Compet-N list would be Demonlord's  current
  one ;-)  ... also watch Kai's E3M6 & MAP06 entries for jumps that
  were not meant to be possible! :-)

  [ .BAT stuff snipped for briefness - it was getting old anyway! ]
