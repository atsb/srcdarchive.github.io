  After making this .lmp I thought: are there any levels that are still
  finished using the old, traditional way, without jumping over unraised
  bridges, without pressing on switches through walls or monsters, and
  without taking keys without lowering platforms or opening doors? Maybe
  id software will make Quake resistent to such quick finishes. Thanks
  to Michael Kren - without his .lmp I would have never known it could
  be finished that way. And sorry for breaking the record ;-)
