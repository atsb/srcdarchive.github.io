  Description :)

  I was kinda surprised that this demo was so fast.  I had
  been getting around 4:30 but without the lindef skipping
  trick, which saves some time but nowhere near 20 seconds.
  I guess it was mostly ok, I remember some parts where the
  punching was not perfect, so maybe under 4 minutes is
  possible.  I'm also curious why Radek didn't use any
  plasma in his demo.
