  Description :-)

  To say the truth, a while back I didn't think a time like
  this would be possible here because Kai's and Anders' runs
  seemed so good back then. Especially that this is 12 seconds
  faster than the previous record and 21 (!) seconds faster
  than Kai's groundbreaking "Chris Boardman" demo.
  I used some new tactics here and there, but none of them
  are really earth-shattering. I left the rising walkway for
  later use, and also grab the BFG as soon as possible. I also
  do the start much faster. Apart from a few shotgun shots
  at the start, I don't use any other weapon other than BFG
  throughout the run.

  I would say it should be possible to do under 1:30 and even
  1:25 with better shots and tactics. One place of improvement
  would be doing the direct jump to the yellowkey baron when
  I return there (hard).

  I exit with 80 cells left, I wonder what I should do with them? :)

  PS. Check out the TAS page soon for a hellishly fast max run
  of this map.
