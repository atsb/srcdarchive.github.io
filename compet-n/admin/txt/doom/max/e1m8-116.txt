Description: Some things has to work out if time is going to be good here.
             The demons in the first room has to take heavy damage (most
             of them should die). Its also important to use the barrels
             in the "star-shaped" room to shave of some spectres. Of course
             the exit-strafe is a "must do"....It's also smart to take some
             damage from the last baron, so that the exit can finish you of
             fast.
