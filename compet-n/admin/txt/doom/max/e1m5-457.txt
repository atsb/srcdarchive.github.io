  Description :-)

  Number four and counting. Good thing I spent "some" time on these
  maps when DooM was Quite New ;-) Seems like I've overcome my four
  cups of coffee - (For those who are still interested in what I do
  besides :-)

 PS: Did I mention that thing 'bout Anthe and Satanic Mechanic already?
     I just talked to Anthe ... Mechanic's first strike is MAP08 (on UV
     of course) in 0:44 - don't miss it!
