C-N entry #128.

I followed Radek's lead with this one.. a fun
level to play through, but being thorough at
areas like the circular yellow room is tough
with monsters milling wherever they please,
so it got old faster.  Something interesting
also happens later on at the blue key, but I
had to watch the demo in slowmo to figure it
out.. it seems like my rocket goes through a
trooper and explodes in the center of the room
(good fortune) but he just gets killed by enemy
fire milliseconds before the rocket hits. :)
