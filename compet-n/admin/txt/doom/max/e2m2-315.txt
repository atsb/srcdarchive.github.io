Description:
A one second improvement, though again, not a mark of laziness.  I usually
don't care for one second improvements when investing time in runs like these
but Doom records have reached that point where I can appreciate having gained
any sort of ground.  This wasn't a bad run, as much of the route hinges on
monsters grouping favorably, particularly in and around the area with the
rocket launcher.  I miss a few punches here and there but the variable damage
output of berserk punches may have required another one or two punches to KO
an imp so I won't let it get to me that much.  Enjoy. :)
