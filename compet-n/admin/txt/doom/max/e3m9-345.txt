Description: 2 years ago I thought of this level as a tough one. But now,
             it is rather easy ;-) I didn't try to take on the Cyberdemon
             without invulnerable. The place in the corner is quite nice.
             The rest is BFG placement and some plasma gun. Without stereo
             sound it is hard to hear the monsters walk around - I should
             really buy a soundcard.
