  Description :-)

  The level looks nice from the automap, otherwise I don't like it... in
  this route (the same as e3m2-233) I don't take the rocket launcher, I
  wonder if it could help or just slow me down... anyway my punching isn't
  very good, not even when the targets don't move (the caco at the area with
  the 100 cells completely ignored my punches ;-), and the lost souls
  decided to block my way too much, otherwise ok I guess...
