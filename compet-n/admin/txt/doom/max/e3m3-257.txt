Description: I never really liked this stage much, until I started recording
             ep3-100% demos. This stage has a lot of BFG shots, probably why
             I like it now. A few improvements over WC's route, and of course,
             I leave the lost souls. The hardest part is getting past the 
             first demon, suprisingly. It took me a number of attempts to get 
             this and about half of those were wrecked cos the demon blocked
             my path.
