C-N entry #158.

Yet another excellent run, Radek. :)
This one went fairly well, though
I'll go ahead and point out the two
blunders that bugged me the most.  I
missed the 200% armor, but I lived,
so no matter.  I also fumbled the exit
door... that really bugged the crap
out of me, but I think my time would
have still been 1:31 without it, altho
barely.

I included a funny easter egg with this
zip, e1m4-imp... you'll see an imp appear
to be killed by another imp's fireball.
I thought it was true, but after watching
it in timer.exe slowmo a few times, you'll
see what really happened too. :)
