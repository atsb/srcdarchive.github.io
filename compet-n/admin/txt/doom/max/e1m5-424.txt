  Description :-)

  I think it's better to play this level like you would play
  it on a "Just Fast" run. - Maybe just because the monsters
  fight more against each other. I just love the scene after
  getting the ChainSaw and SoulSphere, that's a real battle.

  It took me quite a few tries to beat my ol' friend 'ZlatkO
  ThE GoDFatheR' who got the record just for a few days. But
  I'm not too sorry for him as this The COMPET-N! Let's wait
  for Thomas' answer ...
