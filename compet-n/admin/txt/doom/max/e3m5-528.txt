Description: A nice stage but can be very annoying. Having no armour can be
             very frustrating. I died a few times in the blue key room, cos 
             of the damn lost souls. I really hate them. If you get past this
             bit, and do alright when teleporting into the centre, you should
             be able to make it to the superchargers, hence the end easily.
             Of course, berzerking requires a bit of luck - saves a lot of
             ammo, but is very dangerous.
