Description: This stage is very hard. Its taken me numerous times to finish.
             Often, enemies come from the southern part up towards you, and
             you easily forget them, and finish with 97-98% kills. Climbing
             up those boxes at the start is annoying while everything shoots
             at you, and it can be helpful if you can teleport onto the Baron.
             This demo may look a bit krusty but I use a 486-66 and it all
             runs dog slow at the start - have to shrink screen 3 times. A
             similar thing occurs when you play E4M2.
