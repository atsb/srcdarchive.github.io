C-N entry #171.

Thanks to Adam Hegyi for his very nice
max here, same route except for one little
change.  I open the red key area later since
imps would go inside and try to surprise me
while i'm backing in and killing the enemies
outside.  I wasn't thrilled with the way the
demo started, but later on everything came
together as I wanted it to... frustrating map
sometimes in terms of enemy alignment.
