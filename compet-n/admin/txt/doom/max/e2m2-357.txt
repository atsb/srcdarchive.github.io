             Well, first of all Arno, I do not have to be forced back to 
             Compet-N. I have just got this new k6 -400 MHZ, and Doom is 
             running like warm butter on it. No more low-detail playing for
             me!! :-) This is my first .lmp made w/o pressing f5, and I like
             it. Feels a bit odd, but I'll get used too it :-)
             About this .lmp; After getting a 4:03 and a 4:02, I had this.
             Not very good, not very bad. And to all the rest of you who red
             Arno's "special" norwegian message - be glad I didn't transelate
             it :))
