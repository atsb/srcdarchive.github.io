Description: 
  I've just moved my computers round so I've got a better setup
  for playing now.  I was practicing e1m5 in preparation for a
  possible ep1 run (yeah you'd better fear, Adam W).  For some
  reason I was playing really well and I thought instead of wasting
  my time on e1m5, I'd try for this max instead.  I'd been
  practicing e2m1 for a few weeks on and off, but I'd never got
  faster than 1:44.  However as soon as I started playing I felt
  I could get it this time.  After about three runs which messed up
  early on, I got this run.

  Its only 1 second faster than Anders' old demo, but good enough
  for me, I'm not really a fan of this map.  Next one up is e2m2,
  uh oh.
