Comments: Okay, somebody improved all(!!!) the maps of Episode 4, including
	  this one, which is mine. Because it was only a one second improvement
	  (*sigh*), and my record was fairly old, I thought I should get it
	  back. This one is the first LMP better than 1:52, still not perfect,
	  I guess that 1:40 will be more or less optimal unless someone uses
	  a new trick or route. I doubt that the BFG trick (grabbing it through
	  the wall) will help. Or to pass the yellow key area fast the first
	  time, but maybe somebody tries. We'll see.
