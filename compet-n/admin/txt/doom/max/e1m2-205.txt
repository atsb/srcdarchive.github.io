Description: Noticed I was coming close to this record when doing my 100/100
episode runs, so I decided to have a go at it on its own. Used my own route
through the maze, it's faster than the one Anders used as you can just go
all the way around and all the remaining monsters collect handily in one
place for you. I've done a 2:04 leaving one monster behind, and this demo
could definitely still be improved. Imps at the end behaved nicely :).
This beats Anders Johnsen's old 2:06 demo.
