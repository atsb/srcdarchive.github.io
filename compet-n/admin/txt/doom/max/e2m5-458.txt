Description: Damn, I'm tired now. Doom the whole day. Last LMP was a 5:01,
	     not perfect, but it showed that 5 minutes would be possible.
	     I thought I should leave it with this time, had already written
	     the .txt file for it, but couldn't resist to record one last time.
	     I think I should do this more often :) You can see that I miss
	     doors and buttons, even the stimpacks at the end. Can't concen-
	     trate anymore, I've played the whole map without thinking, only
	     reflex actions. Okay, I had luck. Not much, but enough. Both
	     Cacos were killed by the Barons, it's important to have them
	     killed before you run to the plasmagun, or they may sometimes
	     walk to the secret exit amd be out of reach for your cells.
	     Maybe I've wasted some cells at the exit, just wanted the Baron
	     behind all the other monsters to help me, that's why I changed
	     the side. Better would be if the Baron had already decided so
	     I could have taken the other side, anyway. I think compared to
	     the other LMPs also the plasmagun area went fine, because I
	     had still the Radsuit as I jumped down to the 100 cells. Good
	     luck if you ever play that map, maybe you'll find a better way to
	     play it. But I hope you don't :)
	     5 minutes beaten, and 4 minutes are impossible! :)
