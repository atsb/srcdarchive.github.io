  Description :-)

  Just like the case was with E4M9, I looked for a .LMP of the level and I
  couldn't find one anywhere, so I'm once again the first to do this level.
  I was scared at first because I thought that there was a reason why nobody
  did this level before, but when I started playing I found out that no,
  there's no reason and this level is most definitely not difficult. This
  .LMP wasn't supposed to be fast. I just wanted to complete the level on
  Ultra-Violence with 100% kills and 50% secrets (which is the maximum in
  this level, according to the episode 4 secrets list).

  This is my first try, so I still play in an attempt to get hit as little
  as possible, which results in a pretty unjustified slow .LMP but hey, I'd
  love to see a better .LMP of this level as you're now *supposed* to know
  how to complete it.

  ----------------------

  Important note: This .LMP is a part of my .LMP collection for all four
  episodes of DooM (1). This .LMP collection is complete and it's now
  available on ftp.cdrom.com in the directory /pub/idgames/lmps/doom/1.9se
  as the file UDM1FULL.ZIP. Please download it! It has .lmps for all of
  DooM (1) including episode 4, Thy Flesh Consumed, ending each level with
  100% kills and almost every one with 100% secrets.

  ----------------------

  PLEASE give me feedback!! I promise I'll answer and I nearly don't get any
  mail so I'll be very happy to get some, even if it's just "Hi, nice .LMP"
  or something. I'll also be happy to get feedback about UDM1FULL.ZIP.
