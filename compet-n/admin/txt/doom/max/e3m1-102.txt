  Description :)

  OMG! OMG! OMG! I was going for 1:04 since I 
  wasn't satisfied with my two 1:05s before this
  but look at what I've got :))))))

  It seems picking up the rocket launcher and using
  it at the end is only a little less than a second
  faster but that's only if it kills 3 imps.
  
  Happy New Year! And Enjoy!
