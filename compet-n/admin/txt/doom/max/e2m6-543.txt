Description: Thanks to Mike for the tips of not letting out the
lost souls. I think it is better to save most rockets for the
last barons, one does not loose that much time punching cacos,
use however plasma on the one in the green armour room, too many
lost souls for comfort in there.
Since I do not really like this level. This will be my last recording 
of it.. (I am glad I broke the 6 minute barrier:)
If you want to see one of the best lmps ever recorded, watch Kai
whipping HR24!!!
