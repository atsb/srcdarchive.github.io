C-N entry #130.

That was a very nice run, Radek. :)
This level is fun to play through, with
those neat cleanups at the blue key and
the soon-to-follow "swastika" room. I'm
less satisfied with this particular run 
than my previous times, but go figure,
I didn't even think I would be capable
of this time, so I'm happy for the moment.
