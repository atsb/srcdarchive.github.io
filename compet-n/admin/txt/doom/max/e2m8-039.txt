 [ The last movement was made at  00:39 ]


Comments: Like Thomas said, if you want to relax, play some E2M8.
          It is a good idea to take out the fist, you can see this way
          when the Cyberdemon splashes. I changed to fist at 37,57 +/-
          My last movement was in the 39's. And I did move until the end.
          I've got 2 rockets left, often you have fired 50 and have to
          look for another rocket box. I don't know how many rockets such
          a Cyberdemon needs, but in this .LMP some of my rockets missed.
          I think around 40. Let's play that in itytd.
