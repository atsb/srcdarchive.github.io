Description:    Got it now. I don't think there'll ever be an 'optimal'
                route for this level - you get all the big weapons, and
                there's lots of places where they can be used. I do think
                this is the best way to take out those unreachable cacos.
                A 2:1x recording is possible, it will need luck though...
