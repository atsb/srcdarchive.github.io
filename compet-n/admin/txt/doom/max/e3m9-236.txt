Description:   Yes, I know - only one lousy second faster then the privous
               record. But that one was a Kai-Uwe entry, so nope- I'm not
               ashamed. I had lots of 02:34 and 35's, but they all had one 
               imp left :( This one looks ok all the way to the end, I lost 
               time there cause of some wasted cells. With a perfect last part,
               this .lmp could have been a 02:33 I think...Nice map...
               I'll surely defend it.
