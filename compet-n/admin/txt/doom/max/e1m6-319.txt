  Hey man, i'm not a machine, just a human. But it would be really nice to
  improve it by 30 secs. It was pretty hard to beat your 3:22, believe 
  or not. At first i got 3:21, that demo wasn't bad, but only 1 sec faster 
  than you. Then, after next thousands of tries i got this one. And i'm 
  really glad i did it, cuz i was nearly fed up of this map. :)
  btw. John, okay, next round is done, what about e1m5 now ?
