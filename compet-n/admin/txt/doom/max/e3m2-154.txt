Description:

I was just wondering Radek and Anders who were previous record holders didn't 
pick up a rocket launcher. Certainly, you consumed several seconds for getting it, 
but this map has 12 rockets. I therefore tried another route for it. I don't know 
if this route is better or not, but I think it was worth a shot.
