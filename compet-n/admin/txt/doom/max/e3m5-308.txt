Description: It's kinda tricky to get 100% kills here, you can never be
             sure that you've killed all animals. I don't like two places
             on this map. The first one is the blue-key room that is full
             of pretty annoying Lost souls. The second one is the main room,
             I had a red screen all the time, also didn't know who I should
             kill first, my moves look very confused there. But nevermind...
             I mustn't forget to mention Steffen "Rini" Udluft, his route
             is brilliant.
