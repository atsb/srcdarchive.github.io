Ultimately this session came up short, as a one
second improvement was not what I was looking to
accomplish here, but I realize why this record
stuck around for so long.  There's definitely
improvements that can be made, as I've handled
just about every room better in other attempts
at some point, but this level suffers from the
wandering monster syndrome on this route so it's
hard to find motivation to optimize it.

This was primarily done because the older demo
by me was ugly. :D
