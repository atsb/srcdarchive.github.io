  Description :)

  Didn't expect to beat Xit's 1:07.
  The imp room was bad but on the other hand the open area leading the to
  the pinkies hallway was too good :) Also In the end I ran out of shells and
  used the rocket I just picked up to kill the last imp

  The the ending can be done faster by using a rocket to kill 2-4 imps
  I ruined some good runs trying that, one time I got so close, I was shooting the rocket
  at 3 imps from the exit, but an imp ball hit me just before I fired and I died, but the
  demo didn't have good infights anyway, time could've been a high 1:06 or low 1:07
