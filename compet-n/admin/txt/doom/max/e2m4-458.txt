Description: I followd the knocking-master's (Peo's :) route here. Took me
             aprox 50-60 mins to make this one...NOBODY knocks like Peo (see 
             how he handels those cacos for instance), I think most time was 
             gained in the end cause I get the monsters less spread by leaving 
             them behind for a while. Btw Peo: The reason why you had problems 
             with that last super-charge is cause the first bridge must be 
             raised entirely before you activate the second one.
            
             This lmp has its share of faults, still I'm glad I broke the
             5 mins barrier...:-)
        
             Hmmm...I can't stand the thought of e2m2, I'll take that one
             out last in epis2. Lets move on to e2m5. But that's a Kai-entry(!)
             isn't it...should mean trouble :)
