===================================
Description:

I just tweaked the use of rockets from the previous record. I thought 
shooting rockets under stairs was slightly inefficient, so I used them 
after going up stairs which were revealed by a switch with 4 barrels. 
Of course, the previous record was not at all beaten easily only for 
such tweaking. Good monster behaviors was necessary. I thought one or two 
seconds improvement was a limt, so four seconds improvement was pretty nice.
