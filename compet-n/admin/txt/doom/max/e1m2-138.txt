C-N entry #125.

I have to thank Adam Hegyi for his demo, which
I didn't believe I could improve at all until
I somehow managed to get a 1:43 after about an
hour or two of game time.  I was having a lot of
fun with the level, so I kept shaving off second
after second.. until I finally managed a 1:40.00.
Ooooh was I furious at that one.. but, after a few
more hours, I got this by total surprise!  I had
a 1:38 with 97% kills, but never expected to get
a real 1:38 demo.  I hope you enjoy this demo as
much as I enjoyed playing it. :)
