Description:	Sorry Rini, no way with only a 3 seconds improvement to keep
		that map. It's now mine, and I think very hard to improve
		further on. It takes some time to get used to that map, just
		like Doom ][ map 2 where you have to play for 3-4 hours before
		you have a time near 1:30. I used the following tricks here:
		a) wasted some bullets with pistol, because I don't take CG
		b) I know CG is better than SG, but there is less ammo, and
		c) the Cacos come closer much faster when you take the SG
		   because it's on the other side of the door and
		d) you can shoot with SG, press a button and shoot again while
		   the door opens. 1-2 Cacos really hurt, and they need only
		   some explosion damage later to be killed.
	        Most of the rockets for the Barons (when they are close to-
		gether) is in my opinion better. The remaining Cacos need only
		1-2 SG shots most of the time, easy even from a far distance.
		If that map had another cell box, or a SSG (no, it's UDoom :),
		it would need much less luck for a really better time. You've
		got to waste 10 seconds to have some Cacos be attacked by the
		Barons. Who puts in 5 more backpacks? I wonder what the time
		would be then...
		Rini: I first thought your 1:10 was really fine, and it is
		      still the way you play that map. Doom on, maybe
		      you can keep some points then. It's really hard to
		      take over a map when you are new in Compet-n, ask
		      Yonatan. Peo will keep improving Doom ][, so maybe you
		      can play some Doom I maps which really need a better
		      time? Very skilled performance, I must pay attention :)
