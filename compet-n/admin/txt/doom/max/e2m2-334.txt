Description: 

Mmm, Max...
I bet you thought I'd given up on these eh?
In fact I've spent the last two months trying to get this
record.  It was one of Anders later demos, which meant it
was somewhat tougher to beat than those old Ep1 ones :)
This run was blessed with a more or less perfect start,
I made a few mistakes later on (I got a bit nervous), but
its still probably my best max run yet.

Next stop, e2m3...
