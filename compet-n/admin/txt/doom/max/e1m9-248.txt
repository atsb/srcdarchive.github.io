  Description :-)  This map is awful to play speedy, it is a pity
  I could not reach par, the previous record by Yonatan was very
  good, definitely the hardest to beat. This means that episode 1
  is finished for me, e1m8 is not a real compet-n map and e1m1 is
  not from this world. To quote one of Quakers who can win an
  autograph: "Tank you" :)
