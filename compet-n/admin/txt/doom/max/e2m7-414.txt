              Well, it would be hard, but with my new plasma-usage its surely
              possible. I had 04:12 with 98% kills (forgot two imps). This 
              demo has some stupid mistakes around the RL area, w/o them, I 
              would have exited in about 04:10. This took me close to one hour.
