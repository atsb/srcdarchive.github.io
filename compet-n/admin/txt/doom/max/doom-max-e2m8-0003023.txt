===================================
Description: HOLY SHIT!! I killed the Cyberdemon in just 36 rockets, so my RNG luck was just amazing here...except
I missed one rocket, and in theory, assuming I didn't have janky at the start and of course didn't miss that rocket,
perhaps I could have gotten under 30 seconds, basically RNG hell for time! Sure, I beaten 4shockblast's time of
30.91 by .68 seconds, but still, just knowing the fact that I was THIS CLOSE to 29 seconds just made me both glad
and kind of furious. Damn, I could try again but I have been playing for this time for 3 hours now, and for all I
know I may never get this kind of run ever again. A shame really but damn, now this, this is just a really damn
good run.
