C-N entry #127.

Thanks to Radek for his demo here, it was
quite a solid run.  This level is a classic,
although 97-98% kills runs were highly common.
Some monsters on the upper hallways near the
start will head away from the barrels and are
easy to miss, so a little caution was needed
(playing normally is tough when I'm not sure
that everyone was dispatched.. getting a good
time with a missing monster just sucks :).
