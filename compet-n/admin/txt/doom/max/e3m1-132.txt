  Description :-)

  I'm getting pretty close to the par time with this demo. I'm 100% sure it
  is possible under par, and the reason for that is that I did it in 01:27
  with 96% kills, and after checking with iddt-iddt in -playdemo I saw that
  I forgot 1 imp. Killing an imp doesn't take 3 seconds.

  This LMP has many things that aren't perfect. But I'll wait for someone to
  do better for now.

  Is someone going to do fast whole-episode-plus-level-9 recording with 100%
  kills/secret? It's not difficult, and it's a different kind of challenge.
  (Just an idea.)

  PLEASE give me feedback!! I promise I'll answer and it will make me very
  happy!
