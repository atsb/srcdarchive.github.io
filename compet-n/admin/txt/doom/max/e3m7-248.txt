  Description:  Usually I don't try to break any speed or max records,
                they are just too good. But this LMP has its own story:
                Frank Siebers told me how to strafe50 with keyboard
                only (just press StrafeRight + StrafeOn + TurnRight)
                and I planned to play this map on -Respawn with 100%
                kills and secrets, because it gives the opportunity for
                some funny jumps (which become easier with strafe50).
                As usual I first watched the COMPET-N/max record,
                but my HDD wasn't up to date and I watched Blake Cole's
                4:31. That obviously had to be improved, he uses no jump
                trick.
                I played until I got 3:12 and was quite happy until I
                discovered that Yonatan has already done it in 2:52.
                Using his route it has been easy to reach 3:00.
                Especially the kill_four_cacos bfg shot saves some seconds.
                As you can see I'm not used to strafe50 yet and I miss
                two jumps.
