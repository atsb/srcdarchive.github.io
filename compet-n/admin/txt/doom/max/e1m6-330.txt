                 Hm...maybe later John :) . When i first time watched
                 your demo i was quite suprised that u changed the route.
                 But your route is really much faster. I didn't hope that
                 i'm able to beat your record, but after a few attempts i 
                 did 3:32 with 98% kills, so i tried it again and again. 
                 Now i'm quite satified. :)
