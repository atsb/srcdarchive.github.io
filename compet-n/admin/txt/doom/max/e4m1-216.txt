  Description:

  I tried this map for about an hour, but the best I could manage
  was 2:31.  So I tried for another hour, never breaking the 2:31,
  and then finally almost everything went right.  I missed the jump to
  the platform (this can mean death if you're unlucky) and I used a
  rocket on a sergeant but I'm pleased with it overall.  Route credit
  to Anders.

  You'll notice I was a little cautious on the second secret :-)
