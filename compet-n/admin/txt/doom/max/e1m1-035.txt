  Description :

  Some other players tried to beat my old record (40s and 38s) of this
  level. I think it's time to finish this battle. Here is the 35s recording
  (exact: 1243 game tics or 35.51s) and I'm sure it'll take some time to
  improve this any further (I can and I will).
  The par time (30s) is a problem of its own. I don't think it is possible.
  I made it once with 100% kills and 0% secrets.

  In this recording I try some new ways:

    The first sergeant (who gives me my shotgun) is nearly dead as I arrive.
    I shoot him with the pistol from the distance.
    Possible further improvement: 0.5s.

    In the room after the first door I don't hesitate but run forward. The
    last sergeant near the exit survives!
    Possible further improvement: 1s.

    In the room before the level exit I shoot the sergeant and the barrel
    with one shot. This kills the imp and all of the soldiers on the right
    side too.

    The elevator trigger line is too far away but my friend the sergeant,
    who survived, triggers it. I shoot him afterwards.
    I was really surprised as I first realised that this sergeant is able
    to trigger the elevator.
