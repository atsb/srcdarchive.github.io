Description:

Some time ago I said that I've quit Doom. But following a discussion with
Adam, I watched one of my old recordings for this map and wanted to see what
time I could get now. After getting 0:36 in only a few tries, I knew I should
make one final lmp :)

This demo is the result of a two hour session. At first I kept getting 0:36's,
then I got many 0:34's. Each one of them had at least one mistake, so my
goal was to get 0:33 and then stop. Finally, I had a try which seemed like
everything went great. I expected to finally get 0:33, but I was amazed to see
the time was 0:32!

The time can still be improved. It's possible to kill the sergeants in the
start from below, which saves about half a second, but depends a lot on
luck. When leaving the secret area with the lift, two humans were alive.
It's possible to leave it with only one alive. I could have also killed the
imp in that area from closer to the last secret. And, of course, it's
possible to kill the two sergeants in the last secret with one shot. A
perfectly played recording with perfect luck could even get below the par
time - 0:29 is possible. But can anyone do it?

I still consider this lmp to be one of my best ever, and worthy to be my final
lmp :)
