               I agree with the caco-punching Peo, but knocking the first
               baron saves alot of rockets. I used fists gainst that
               green-armour guard too, but it can be dangerous.

               Well, the gameplay is ok IMO, but the design is pitfull.
               Glad I broke the 5 minute barrier btw :-) Couldn't have done
               it w/o Peos great route though! Making this lmp took around
               25-30 mins, not counting IDDQD-practice. E2M7 next!
