Comments: A nice level, tons of ammo, some health, no invulnerable and
          a telefrag. Nearly as nice as doom2 level 29 ;-). I improved
          the old one by some seconds. Unluckily I failed to jump from
          the megaarmor behind the blue column. This is the way to get
          the BFG earlier and to kill those Cacos at the end. Then you
          have got another 200-300 cells there - which could be rather
          useful. Plus I fell down some more times. As you see, you do
          not have to visit any place twice - except perhaps the start
          point and the Cyberdemon. Especially at the yellow key there
          is no need to go there twice. As I watched the old .LMP from
          Paul Falstad I was surprised that you could raise the floor.
          I didn't know it ! I thought Paul should have been mentioned
          this here. It seems that U4M2 was his last record :-(
