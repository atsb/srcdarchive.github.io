Description: A few changes from the last recording. Rockets were very well
             placed at the start. Left the berzerk and killed the demons
             in the acid pit before going into the final room, and when I
             was there, the BFG were well placed for once. Oh yeah, there
             were a few lost souls left over but they dont count anyway,
             but it _is_ best to get rid of them, since the only way to
             check the kill % is with IDDT.
