Description: Hm.., finally is it below 3:30. I was lucky in the red-key 
             room, because i killed all monsters quite fast. But i did a
             few mistakes when i went for a yellow key. And the end is
             really horrible, because i wasted 2 rockets (!!) and then 
             I killed those stupid pigs by chaingun. That time could be
             really better, maybe next time.
