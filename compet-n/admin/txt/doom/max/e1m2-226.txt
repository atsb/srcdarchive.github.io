Description: TZ: Yes, only temporary. I joined your competition. But very
             fast old time indeed ;-). Had to try 15 times. Looks like I
             should use shotgun every time on that final imp as it always
             blocks me. The rest is chaingun as the best weapon for this
             level, except perhaps for plasma gun ;-)
