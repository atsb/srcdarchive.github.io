  Description :-)

  Another quite sloppy one in the let's-see-whether-I-can-beat-Eelco
  series, recorded on this grey'n'rainy Saturday afternoon. I'm not
  too proud of that one either, it's just ... faster than Eelco! ;-)
  Mission complete (Oh, wrong game - Sorry! :-)

  I did *not* include a .BAT with this, 'coz every serious LMPer (like
  Anthe and me) has a high-sophisticated one of his own to handle this
  stuff - right? ;-)

 PS: Also check out Anthe's COMPET-N LMPs, and his DHT entries as well
     (He's the AAK guy). And be prepared for Satanic Mechanic's .LMP's
     He's Anthe's brother - Coming to a server near you soon! :-)
