  Description :-)

  Still a bit sloppy, but gettin' better (obviously - almost one whole
  minute faster than Eelco!). Take this hint, mousers: the more coffee
  you drink & cigarettes you smoke, the less sensitive your mouse should
  be - for example, 4 cups of coffee plus one packet of cigarettes plus
  mouse sensitivity 100 (DOS) plus mouse sensitivity 9 (DooM) don't mix
  too well ... guess why I know !? ;-)

  I did *not* include a .BAT with this, 'coz every serious LMPer (like
  Anthe and me) has a high-sophisticated one of his own to handle this
  stuff - right? ;-)

 Thomas

 PS: Don't miss Anthe's "just fast" entry on this level - his time of
     0:27 (yes, only twenty-seven seconds!) is even faster than Uwe's
     and Steffen's entries !
     And try to remember this name: Satanic Mechanic !
