===================================
Description:

I was exhausted for this. The BFG's room had a terrible defect. 
One or two imps almost never appeared smoothly. I occasionally 
waited the last one for a few tens of seconds. Under 3 min was 
definitely possible but many runs were ruined by the defect. 
Excluding this room, this map is excellent and uv-max route 
is also outstanding. According to Radek's e3m5-308.txt, the 
route's credet goes to Steffen "Rini" Udluft. Thanks!
