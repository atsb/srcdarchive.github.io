Description: This is one of my favourite stages. I have recorded many demos
             for this one even while I was using the keyboard only. My demo
             is based on Simon Widlake's except just a bit quicker. To save
             a lot of time you have to make the Barons kill the Spider at
             the end. Therefore you can save a lot of plasma and can shoot
             BFG's at will.
