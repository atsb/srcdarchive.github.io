  Description :-)

  Yet another map I don't like very much, but I think my route is pretty
  good and the lmp isn't very bad either, it can probably be done under par
  too... the maze is simpler than it looks, all ways lead to where you need
  to go and the BFG is really simple... the only problem is I have
  potentially (I run across, but I don't have to take) 60 cells in the end,
  but not before, how do I use them?
