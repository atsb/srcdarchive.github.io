Description:	Because I had mentioned this map in e2m9-051.txt, I thought
		I should see which time I would get today.
		First I simply improved Peo's previous record with a 3:06.
		Then I thought, why don't beat 3 minutes. I got a 2:59
		with the 5th try, and wrote in the .txt that I'll leave it
		to others to improve this further. But why not do that
		myself? After 10 more tries I got the first better than 2:54,
		this one. There are some lucky scenes: I leave the Cyberdemon
		with 38 rockets, maybe because I missed only a few and most
		of the rest hit him in the middle, at the Chainsaw one rocket
		I thought I should fire to the second group of spectres hit
		the 3rd group because of a sudden turn as I realized that the
		2nd group is already dead, the Cacos at the Plasmagun took
		only few rockets, but most important is that the 2 Cacos and
		the two remaining Imps (the 3rd one was killed, you can here
		the "awaken" sound of a Caco when I pass the door to the pigs)
		I decided to do it my way in the Seargents area, I dunno which
		one is better, Peo's or mine, but at least it looks fine to
		have a lot of Seargents glowing green. Sometimes I need only
		2 BFG for the Barons. I doubt that PAR will be possible, I
		might try it if you give me BFG and extra 40 cells to kill the
		Cyberdemon much faster :).
		Last: This LMP is ONE minute faster than my old record!
