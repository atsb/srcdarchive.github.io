  Description :)

  This is probably one of my favourite levels, and I like
  playing this max style because there's a lot of punching.
  This took me a little while to beat, but not too bad.
  I used Anders Johnsen's route here, which is modified
  from Peo's route, and I think I may have a few modifications
  as well.
