 Description: A fun but pain in the ass level. I played this level
 for about two hours before I finally got it. It was a challenge to
 beat the previous time of 2:48 set by "MK", but I also had monsters
 that just didn't want to cooperate and die for me, therefore I was
 ending up with a 95 or 98% kill total and was getting madder by the
 minute. Finally, I had a pretty good run.

 PS: Although DooM is aging quickly, it's still a rush to go in and
 frag the "hell" out of some monsters.
