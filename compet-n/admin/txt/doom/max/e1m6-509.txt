 Description: This is a run and gun level. Right: much area to
 cover, you need to be pretty acurate with your shots, the more
 you miss the longer it will take. Another one of those levels
 where a monster can easily be left behind and force one to take
 their frustration out on their keyboard.

        !!!! Wouldn't even think about it !!!!
