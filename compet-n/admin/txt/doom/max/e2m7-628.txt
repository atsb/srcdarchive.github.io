Description: Silly design of the map. The silliest thing is the supercharge
             hidden at the start plus the 100 cell box - Completely useless.
             Then you can furthermore decide to run to the berserk or to go
             for rocket launcher and plasma gun. If the second, you have to
             run all the way back to the blue key. It's a level that looks
             like, if you wanna make it fast, you have to use plasma on the
             pigs (instead of berserk), and the result is an uninteresting
             recording.
