  Description :-)

  Watched Yonatan Donner's 1304 lmp once to "learn" the map & then tried
  it myself. I do not play doom 1 myself very much (miss the ssg and the
  monsters from doom2). If someone has the patience to learn this map he
  should be able to go down to 4 or 5 minutes perhaps even less, you can
  see that I'm really lost on this map!

[  Admin. Note :-|  I remember that I rejected a .LMP with this filename
   ages ago because it arrived in a corrupted form... Anyway it has been
   well and truely crushed [ U4M9-449 ] and that was also ages ago... Oh
   well, always catching up...
