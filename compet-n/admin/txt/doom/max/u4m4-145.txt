Description:   Kais time was pretty good...you need luck at some stages
               to beat it. Normally I ended up around 1:49 - 1:55. The
               punches are vital, I did some lousy imp-punching. Those nasty
               gunners in the end confused me too...I would guess
               1:40 to be optimal here- but THAT would require luck and
               tons of patience.
