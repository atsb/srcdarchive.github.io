  Description :-)

  Woke up today with one thought on my mind: I guess I'll try to beat
  Eelco's best times on DooM COMPET-N, just to show that he's not the
  only one still playing good ol' DooM. So I did, and it felt like home
  to wander through the ExMy maps :-) This is the first level I tried,
  and it's played quite sloppy (I only had one cup of coffee since I
  left my bed ;-) - I didn't care about health'n'ammo either, there's
  enough goodies around. I will *not* even think about trying to beat
  Uwe's E1M1-040 ... the skill gap is just too big! :-(

  I did *not* include a .BAT with this, 'coz every serious LMPer (like
  Anthe and me) has a high-sophisticated one of his own to handle this
  stuff - right? ;-)

 PS: If you want to see *really* great LMPs, check out all the stuff my
     friend Anthe recorded (both COMPET-N and DHT. His initials are AAK
     available .LMP's at the time of writing are: D2M, D2SG and D2I-AAK
     - D2GM still under construction :-) His brother, Satanic Mechanic,
     is also ready to go in the meantime!
