Description:  Finally below par! :)
              This time was very hard to get, I kept playing for at least
              three houers straight. I think this is one of my best lmps so
              far. John, your run is still *great*. I feel a bit bad about
              taking away your point, I'm sure you put alot of effort into
              that 2:52 recording. Many of your new, great tactics where used
              in this lmp, combined with Peos original strategy, this should 
              make the more or less ultimate route...
