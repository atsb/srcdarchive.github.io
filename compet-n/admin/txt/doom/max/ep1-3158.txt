  Description :-) It is still hard keeping the concentration
  for a long period, around 26 minutes should be the optimal
  for episode 1. That is for a "fastcat" like Kai or Yonatan...
  For me? 28 minutes perhaps!!!

[  Admin. Note :-)  This kind of entry is NOT the kind of thing I was
   looking for, as missing a monster or a secret would make the whole
   .LMP "invalid", but if that's what you players want to play for...

   So be it ! To beat this entry you must score more kills(!) or more
   secrets(!) (NOT possible) OR go FASTER _without_missing_anything_!

   Oh, how many points does this score --> FOUR ! [ For now ;-) ]
