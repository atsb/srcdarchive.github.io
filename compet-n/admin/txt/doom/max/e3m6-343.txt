	     First of all a huge thanx to JK for the route. I just knocked
             some of the cacos instead of using chaingun, think it cuts some
             ten secs or so. Spent about one hour with this level now, took a
             while to remember where to go. Nice map. Think I'll do it for the
             tyson cat now...Btw, sorry bout those confusing movements in the
             exit-pit, I got a bit dissoriented after blasting the RL :-)
