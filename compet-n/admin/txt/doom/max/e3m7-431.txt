[  Admin. Note :-)  Someone else still plays DooM ;-) And pretty
   fast too - 4:31... "Not bad, Blake" ;-)  I'm fairly sure that
   this map could be completed even faster (see: Uwe's E3M7-118)
   though maybe that would not count for 100% secrets ? I dunno.

   It would be nice if you guys included a (short) description !

   Anyway, well done !  [ Have you got m/any more ? ;-) ]
