Description:
	Oops, there was a flaw in the .txt file for the -225 demo. Did
	you notice it?
	Anyway, I don't like one second improvements (at least in max
	demos), and I had some ideas how to improve the run. And it was
	still fun to play that map.
	I got another -225 fairly soon on the new route, and many others
	in the 2:27-2:34 range, but no real good one. I knew that I should
	be able to complete that map with a 2:22, but something always went
	wrong.
	And then I got this run. If you watch it, you'll notice that many
	mistakes, that you'll probably start to record a faster demo at
	once. Here's the list of mistakes: 
	- I miss the door and waste a shotgun shot (the shot is fairly
	  important to have the pigs aligned)
	- I fail to open the secret door and have to turn back.
	- I miss one of the rocket boxes. It's a miracle that 33 rockets
	  were enough.
 	- I nearly commit suicide at one of the Cacodemons, I guess I wanted
	  to save a rocket ...
	- I miss more spectres than usual.
	- And in the end, the Seargent walks out of the BFG's cone of damage,
          and I have to wait there until I got the plasma gun ready.a

	And then, there is the part, where I thing I saved all the time:
	I finish the plasma gun room fast and in the hallway, the Cacos and
	Imps just align perfect. I've never had a run before were the
	invulnerability was active until just before the red key.

	We're not far away from PAR (2:15) now, it might be possible in a
	quite perfect run. That's why I've included another demo, to show
	where to save some more seconds. It's a "perfect" Cyberdemon kill,
	even better than Radek's in the -226 demo. I have 47(!) rockets
	for the way back. That's nine rockets more than I have in this demo
	(if I had taken the missed rocket box, of course :)

	Radek, your turn now :) Good luck!
