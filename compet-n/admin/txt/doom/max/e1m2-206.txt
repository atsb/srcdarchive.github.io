Description: I didn't find Peo's 02:08, but it must have been good, cause
             it was hard to beat :) I watched his 02:14 and used that route.
             I had one 02:04 but managed to overwrite it -STUPID-!
             So 1:59 should be very possible, but will require houers of 
             playing I guess...Man how I hate that dam imp in the exit (and
             the maze-part too, though the rest of the map is great).
