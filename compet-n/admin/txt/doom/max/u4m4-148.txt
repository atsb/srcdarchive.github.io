Description: Never trust Peo! Just a few hours after my 1:53 he surprised me
	     with a 1:51. Now that I've sent him a new e1m3-257 (only 1
	     second away from the record) with a better way, so I hope
	     he'll record that map first and not this one. Anyway, I'm very
	     satisfied with this LMP. 3 shells left at the start is best
	     (I had 5 once, but never happened again), the sergeants at
	     the berserk are killed with one shot, only one at the RL sur-
	     vived, some monster fights, boith Cacos with only three punches
	     and without a long lasting chase (I was still invulnerable at
	     the red key!), the pigs punched fast, the Imp, maybe some tenth
	     of a second lost, but not more, 3 sergeants with one shot, Caco
	     and Imps killed with one rocket, one sergeant telefragged, Imps
	     with two rockets, missed the SG shot (better look out for Imps),
	     but the Cacos took 17 punches, maybe it could have been 2 seconds
 	     less. Thanx Peo for the suggestion not to take the CG. I've tried
	     to kill some Imps with a rocket while beeing invulnerable after
	     I teleport, but you can never be sure how many you hit, but it
	     might be the better way?!? Peo: do you want still this map?
