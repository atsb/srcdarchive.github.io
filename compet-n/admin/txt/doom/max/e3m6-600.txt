Description: Finally someone's attempted this stage. It takes a lot of
             planning to finish properly and ammo is sparse throughout.
             The main trick here is to leave the souls - thanks to Kai.
             Really stuffed up that end bit though. Time can be easily
             beaten however and I'm working on it. I'll directly quote
             Wade Cayton here. I'll give credit where it's due. SW, DL,
             UG, KH, WC, MK, VS, SW(uk man) & EM + more.
             You guys are all legends - and have got me into this.
