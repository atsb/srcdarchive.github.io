Description: Another stage which nobody has attempted - guess that's why
             I'm doing it - as most times for other stages are very hard
             to beat. Looks a tad messy in places but otherwise ok. Ammo
             is sparse at first. Very easy after the Cyberdemon, you can
             literally waste rockets. Time is beatable however.
