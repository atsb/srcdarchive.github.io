===================================
Description:

Memfis suggested some new tactics in his e4m6-301. The record itself was 
5 seconds slower than Vile's compet-N record (2:56), but his route had 
a good potential of improving max record. His uses of rockets and cells 
were effective, then he did not pick up a soul sphere. I used his route 
with some tweaking for more effective use of weapons. I got 2:55 early, 
then below 2:50 seemed to be possible but it was very hard target. 
This run is pretty smooth, excluding not killing the cyberdemon with 
two shot of BFG. I was satisfied this record.
