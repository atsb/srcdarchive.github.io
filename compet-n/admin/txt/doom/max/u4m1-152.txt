===================================
Description:

Ian's demo was very old but really strong. It was very rare that all five 
barons gathered smoothly in front of a grate. I could get below 2 min mostly 
if it occurred, but it was hard to beat his record. After some demos in 1:56 
or 1:57, I obtained this record at last.
