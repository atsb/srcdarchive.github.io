C-N entry #75.

My goal here was under 3 minutes, which came
with a few seconds to spare.  Getting the red
key grab to work on the first try was crucial
when the times got below that mark, and it
didn't want to happen all the time, unfortunately. :)

This could have been better, but I played this level
out and want to concentrate on other stuff (pn/ps).
