  Description:  

  Well, this is far from a perfect demo, the rockets usage
  is absolutely awful. I really hate when Caco doesn't die
  after 2 rockets. Anyway, i've had enough of 98% kills demos
  for now. Claudio, thanks for reminding me to play this map,
  the old record needed improvement for sure. I hope you don't
  mind including your demo into the zip. It's a very nice Max
  demo a everyone should check it out.
