Description:  1 second faster than Anders' record :). As he commented, it's
              the mother of all 99% maps :(. Thing that always seems to get
              left behind is the spectre - on this .lmp I got semi-lucky,
              didn't kill it but somehow it got through the yellow door.
              I wasn't expecting this to be quick at all, there's lots of
              slow parts, so i'd agree with Anders' comment that sub 3
              mins should be possible quite easily. Maybe even sub-2:50?
