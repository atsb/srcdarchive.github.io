  Description :-)

  ZlatkO strikes again ... Now it's time for the Episode 2 monsters to
  contribute their stinkin' bodies to my 100% kills score! Yeah, and
  don't miss this special: in the room with the plasma gun, there's a
  scene where I make a really Steffen-ish spin (at the Caco), it looks
  just like "him" - too bad I don't know how I did it! ;-(

  I *did* include a .BAT with this, 'coz S.;-) takes good care of all
  the newbies out there :-) However, I'm convinced that every serious
  LMP'er (like Anthe and I) has a highly sophisticated one of his own
  to handle this stuff - right? ;-)

 PS: Thanx to 'Anthe' for uploading ... did I ever mention that he has
     recorded some LMPs too? ;-) BTW, I really wonder what happened to
     my own ftp access at work!? :-(
