Description:	Yeah! This is the result of 3 (three!) days work. I'll put
		also all the other lmps equal or better than the previous
		0:56 record on my page. I had a 0:54 after threee hours, the
		next day another 0:54 and a 0:55, then I got the LMP of the
		record, watched it and noticed what was different. He took
		the keys much faster (I thought it doesn't matter, if I only
		hit with the shots, and then stood for a while between Barons
		and Cacos, to have both sides been hit even when they atttack
		me. Very smart way. One of the 5 seconds advantage I get
		because I open the door faster, the other four are hard, I
		would say every second counts twice because you'll not get the
		damage of monster fights for this time. It's important to
		fire at least one, better two or three rockets at the Cacos,
		best when they surround one Baron.
		I got a 0:53, but a very low one (53,1), so I tried for hours
		to get a 0:52, but I got none. Meanwhile I realized that the
		time depends much on the shells I've got left, this is because
		I hold down fire all the time from the first shot on. 28 shells
		equals a 0:55-0:56, 24 a 1:00, 18 a 1:06 and so on. That's why
		I tried too to get the keys as fast as possible, the more time
		I waste there, the less shells I've got left, and the worse the
		time will be. Also it's easier to escape the exit then, no
		Cacos blocking you. 
		I was really surprised that after all four Barons were dead,
		only two Cacos had survived, lokk how much ammo I waste until
		I realize that no pain sound means that noone is alive anymore.
		It's also not easy to see monsters sometimes, the pit is damn
		deep and the half tomatoes on the ground make it difficult to
		see other tomatoes still alive.
		Later, as I watched it with timedemo, I realized that the shot-
		gon is really far a wy from the center of the screen, it's
		more at the right side of the head. That's why some shots hit
		totally different or miss half, that was not the intention.
		Fortunately this effect disappeared when I took the rocket
		launcher, or I would have punished all the walls and hurt
		myself. Uhm, long text, hope I haven't missed anything.
		Except for the name of the guy who forced me to play this map
		again, but I like this beautiful map, if Peo hadn't set a
		fine time in e3m9 and the first stage would be more fun e3m9
		would be mine too after a week or two :). Like e4m2 still is.
		Btw, might be one day this time will be improved further on
		by using the yellow key trick, see the speed record for what
		I mean. Dunno if it helps, but it could be worth a try.
