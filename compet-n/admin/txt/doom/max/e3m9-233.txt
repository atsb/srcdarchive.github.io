    Description:  

    Anders claims he played it just one hour to get 2:36, 
    but I don't belive him. :))) It was pretty hard to beat
    his 3 year old demo. Actually I think it was one of his
    best demos he recorded back in 1999. 
    
    The demo is ok, finally both Cacos waited for me, so I 
    didn't have to hunt them anywhere. (They like hiding
    in the Imp's room.) The Cybie room was ok too. I usually
    pressed "Q" when I had less than 32 rockets on the way
    back.
