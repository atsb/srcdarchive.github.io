Description: Changed my mind, didn't want to wait with this one, better to
             get it over with. The result did not turn out as I had hoped,
             pretty early in this (rather long sesion) I had 04:17 with
             one forgotten secret. IMO at least 04:10 should be possible using 
             this route (slightly modifyed Greensland route). But then there
             is this new route Rini used...wonder if its better?
             The ultimate route could lead to this map being done below 4 mins.
             
             My knocking is not very convinsing in this demo, but I'm tired 
             now, I've had enough crates and imps for one evening...

             Then again; Think I'll do a -fast lmp now to REALLY put this map 
             behind :)
