Description: A fun map, and also a very famous one. Do you remember your first
	     time you've met the Barons? I do, they scratched me even though I
	     attacked them with Chainsaw!!! Incredible strong monsters! I died
	     often when starting with pistol (rockets were easier :). Today,
	     when people punch fast Cyberdemons (I don't, btw), it's just a
	     a reminder that we all started with being scared by Imps :)
	     I just wanted a time in the 1:30, PAR is 0:30, btw. Just to have
	     some others play that map too. I think one could play this map
	     about 10 seconds faster, when you only hit the Barons (maybe hide
	     in their caves?) and kill all the Spectres while waiting for the
	     stair to be built. The only secret is the Supercharge in this map.
	     You know when you got it (unlike u4m1 :)
	     Please feel free to play this map, that's why it's just an average
	     to good time.
	     There are 41 monsters in this map, 26 of the mare supposed to be
	     killed. I got these 10 Spectres, 14 Demons and 2 Barons, there
	     are 4 more Demons, 6 Sergeants and 5 Imps in the last room, at
	     least two of the Sergeants died too. Anyone ever managed to kill
	     them all?
