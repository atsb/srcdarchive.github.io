  Description:  I like maps in which you can use the rocketlauncher
                a lot. This map is one of my favorites anyway.
                I played that map for the -fast, -respawn and now
                max category.
                For -fast I took it savely in 9:57.That has been easy.
                Surprisingly it has been easier to beat the record in
                the max category than to survive at all on -respawn.
                Try it yourself, it's fun!
