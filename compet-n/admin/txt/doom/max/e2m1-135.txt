Comments:

Bleh, I'm not satisfied with this demo at all. I had a relatively fast start
and the run had potential for 01:33, but I stupidly waste time in the last
half. 01:32 is definitely possible even if you're just a player of very
limited skill like me. I don't think this record will hold long - it's
just too mediocre and improvable. I sent it because I wanted it to make the
compet-n update which AdamH had estimated to take place the next day. Expect
improvements soon. From one person or another.
