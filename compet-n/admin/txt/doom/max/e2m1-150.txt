  Description :-) Took me many tries to improve, it might look simple
  but there are some things that must really work if it is going to be
  under 2 minutes, like for instance the troopers who must be "online" :)
  so one shot results in multiple deaths, it helps if the imp and the
  2 sergeants fight the pigs and weaken them while being eaten up. I
  was also a lucky that one sergeant shot the invisible pig in the back
  and my next shot killed both. Unfortunately I was too eager at the exit
  and wasted some plasma at the retracting wall, otherwise it had been
  under 1:50. Well, you cannot win them all! :) This will be my last ever
  Compet-n entry unless being a part of a coop team. I do not like any
  other Doom1/Ultimate map..
