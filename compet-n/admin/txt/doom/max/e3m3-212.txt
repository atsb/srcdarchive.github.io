  Description :)
  After looking at vdgg's very well made leaderboard of current records,
  consisting of both Hegyi/Pre-Hegyi era demos as well as /incoming demos, I
  noticed that E3M3 MAX was in yellow, meaning a faster time exists than the
  current COMPET-N record but isn't valid due to the fact that it was
  recorded with an exe other than the original exe. That demo was E3M3-216
  by Kyle McAwesome, he used PRBoom v2.5.0.8 to record it. I quickly got a
  time of 2:17, which beats Radek Pecka's valid COMPET-N entry of E3M3-218,
  but I was not satisfied because Kyle McAwesome still had a faster time.
  I then got a time of 2:16, just as Kyle McAwesome did, my exact time was
  2:16.43 and his exact time was 2:16.77, so I beat him but I was still
  unsatisfied that it wasn't by a second, according to the Doom tally
  screen. Then to my surprise, I somehow got E3M3-212, beating the COMPET-N
  record by SIX seconds. In E3M3-212, I thought I missed one monster, good
  thing I didn't go looking for it.

  Ahh, it's not everyday you beat a record by six seconds, especially when
  it's on a 1993 WAD.

    WTF do you want me to put here??? Well Eelco de Vries's E3M3-247.TXT is
    interesting so I'll post that:
     "It should be possible to time this level near 2.35. Since i made
     several mistakes. This is the 2nd record in a row i take from Michael.
     Sorry. But i am afraid of Anders, who is reaching episode 3, and will
     surely crush mine. The hardest part is to be secure and have a bit of
     luck so now and then. :)" - Eelco de Vries
     
    Now let's have a look at Anders Johnsen's E3M3-224.TXT:
     "> As Donatas i think that below 2.30 should be possible, but you
     > need quite a bit of luck!
                
     Naaa, come on guys...2:15 should be more like optimal. Spent
     around two hours all in all with this map and got several low
     2:20's (98-99% kills) with lots of mistakes. Kept this one cause
     I like the way some shots tourned out :-)" - Anders Johnsen
    
     
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 2:18 by Radek Pecka, timestamped:
  Thursday, March 21, 2002, 7:00:52 PM.
