  EP.4 MI.8 - "Z" - Fastest Finishing of the mission.

  Description :-)

  ... Fast - And Good ...

  Thought I might try to "Steffenate" this mission... Started with
  a time of 5:?? something, then dragged this down to a much lower
  4:?? something... 3:25... 3:16... and then 3:01 ! Though I could
  not break into the 2:?? something range - it's close ! I "waste"
  time picking stuff off the columns but I needed (?) the ammo. It
  is probably possible to do a faster time than this... but not by
  very much and not without that BFG :-)
