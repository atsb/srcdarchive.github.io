  Description :-)

  After playing this map with -respawn, I thought of trying the max version.
  Well, my first try came at 1:50, so I knew this wasn't going to be too hard.
  I got an 1:45 afterwards, but it was a low one, so I played on. Then I got 
  an 1:44, but the start was bad, and it was also a low one, so I decided to
  try more. Now I got this nice run... Well the start is still quite bad,
  and it's another low one :) but I'm quite satisfied with the last 1 minute
  of the LMP, so I'm stopping here.
