  Description :-)

Damn, this can't be true. I was just trying to make a good Public DANG time.
I didn't even know about the current record. When I connected, I checked the Compet-N
records list, and I couldn't believe my eyes. That's a world record damn it :)
This is my first Compet-N record, so I would like to say thank you to some people.

Thanks to Marko Van der Want, who invited me to the Doom scene. I would be nobody without his help.
to Adam Hegyi who is my local - the best player in my opinion - and a great cooperative partner.
to BahdKo, who showed me how to play DM, I can't say enough thank you.
to all the #nightmare regulars, who kept my spirit up on my bad days.
to my friends who I talk to on ICQ and in query on IRC all the time, they helped me a lot.

And of course thank you for reading this txt, and watching my demo.
