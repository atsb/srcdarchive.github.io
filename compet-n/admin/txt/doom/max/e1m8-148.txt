  Description :-)

  First of all, HELL REVEALED project is progressing again, expect the best
  and hardest megawad ever ready in 6 months or so!! Go to my homepage for
  more details at http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/4704.

  Ok, I was surprised to see there was nothing better for this than 2:10 (no
  offense, Simon ;-), it's just my first try...

  Added bonus: I didn't get hit at all until the final room...

[  Admin. Note ;-)  None taken ;-)  These E#M8-mss and Ep#Mi8-x entries
   are a bit of a mess [ check both the doom and doom/speed directories
   since neither the kills nor time is given they're a bit difficult to
   score ] but the current time is around the 1:30-something mark.
