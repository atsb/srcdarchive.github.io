===================================
Description:

I changed a strategy of the final room from a way of UV-Speed, though 
I had should come up with it early. Of course, the strategy was risker. 
This run was pretty smooth. I had few mistakes and rocket's behaviors 
were almost good. The only unfortunate thing was that a specter did not 
cooprate me because it was stuck on a lift. Certainly under 3 min is 
definetely possible with this route, but much luck would be necessary, 
for example behaviors of barrels in the red key's room, demoms in the 
computer room, enemies in the final room, and so on. I don't want to 
repeat this route earnestly for not being able to keep motivation. 
I will try it again if I come up with some new ideas.
