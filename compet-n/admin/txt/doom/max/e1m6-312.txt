===================================
Description:

stx-Vile's run (e1m6-313.lmp) was really impressive. He dealt with 
enemies in a red key's room very quickly and killed 5 demons by 
two shots each other in a computer room before yellow key's doors.  
This demo also didn't have any noticeable mistakes. I could never 
beat it with the same route. I just came up with a new route for 
killing demos more efficiently, but much luck was necessary because 
one or two demons frequently went to the first area. I made 3:0x with 
not 100% kills many times. A vaild max which was faster than the previous 
record was only this demo on doom time by the end of this year.  
I wan't satified with this record wich was one second improvement from 
the previous record. It would be faster, then sub-3 min would be gotten 
finally.
