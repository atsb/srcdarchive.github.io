  EP.4 MI.8 - "C" - Finishing the level with the Most Armour left.

  Description :-)

  ... Slow - But Good ...

  -Record'ed this .LMP a couple of months ago but forgot to upload
  it. Anyway this mission was/is still vacant so I thought I would
  take it. I frag everything and finish it with both 200% health &
  armour, just because they are there ;-) This is really cheap ( &
  I nearly get killed no less than 3 times ) but I need the point.
