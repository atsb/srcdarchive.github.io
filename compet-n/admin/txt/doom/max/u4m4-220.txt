  Description :-)

  This level must be even more boring than Frogstar B ;-)

  It took me 3 tries to get this lmp. The reason I made it is that I had 10
  spare minutes until having to go and nothing to do in these 10 minutes,
  since what can I start in 10 minutes without having to stop in the middle?
  So since I was in the mood for some COMPET-N action after finally watching
  all new interesting entries in the COMPET-N August update, I did this. It
  does *not* mean that I am back to playing COMPET-N. So don't get any
  hopes, Prostetnic Vogon Peo ;-)

  Long live Zaphod Beeblebrox (and his other head too)! ;-)

  Ah, yes, right, my homepage is at:
