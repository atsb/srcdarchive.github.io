  Description :-)

  A significant time improvement compared to the current entry  ...

  Notes on the 100 % scorings: First, the 100 % kills can easily be
  verified with <TAB> - IDDT - IDDT. The monsters in the final room
  are, however, excluded from the scoring (of course! ;-).  Second,
  the switch in the right Baron chamber (which lowers the elevator)
  does *not* count as a secret according to  Paul Falstad's  DooM I
  Secret FAQ, so my 100 % secrets scoring is correct as well. :-)

  I *did* include a .BAT with this, 'coz  S.;-)  takes good care of
  all the newbies out there. :-)  However, I'm convinced that every
  serious LMP'er (like Anthe and me) has a highly-sophisticated one
  of his own to handle this stuff - right? ;-)
