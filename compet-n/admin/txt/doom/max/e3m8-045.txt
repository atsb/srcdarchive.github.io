Description :)

Optimizing Panter's route a bit... :)

I'm quite satisfied with this recording, it went fine.
This one needs more luck that UV Speed or Nightmare - the monsters have to
fight each other so that you don't waste much ammo.
Time is quite good, actually I did better than Panter's first UV Speed time.

IMHO around 0:40 is possible here.
