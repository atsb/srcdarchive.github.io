  EP.2 MI8. - "B" - Finishing the level "The "Cheats" Way".

  Description :-)

  Ended the level with 200% Health and 200% Armour... by
  using the "cheats" method of hiding behind the central
  column that allows MY rockets to fly over it, where-as
  "His" rockets are blocked BY it ! I made a fairly good
  start by concentrating on "them stupid skulls"... then
  trapping  "The Big Guy" somewhere useful... I tried to
  avoid the nice power-ups (I might've needed 'em _IF_ I
  took a hit... but that is rather difficult here) but I
  got them anyway ;-( ;-). I was a "bit unlucky" with my
  rocket-aim, but I would have had to have gone back for
  more ammo, at least once, anyway... :-)
