Description : Didn't wanna upload because of the lameness in the end...
	      however...with my skills this seems real hard to beat
              and uh, ever since I got internet access last fall I haven't
              been able to squeeze any real good run outta myself except perhaps
              one lucky nomo, but that dont count. I guess
              it's easier to BS about doom stuff on irc than to actually play
              it and put in the work required to do good stuff.
