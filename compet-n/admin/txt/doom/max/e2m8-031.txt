  Description :-)

  Woohoo! Only two days after my first Compet-N record I improve it :)
  This demo took me 45 tries, which is very few compared to the fact, that
  the player needs lots of luck on this map. I had another huge luck at the
  end, when that stupid monster came into my way, and I almost killed myself with
  the last rocket. 10% was really close hehe. So have fun watching this demo.
  I liked to make it :)
