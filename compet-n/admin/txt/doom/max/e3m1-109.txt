Description: The little brother of e3m9. I remember that I've played it long
	     ago, fighting hard for a time around 1:30. Than Yonatan recorded
	     an incredible 1:22, even though he said he lost still 7 seconds
	     overall. Today I run first his way, got 1:19 twice. Then I
	     tried to analyse the map, and decided to have a longer lasting
	     monster fight. Already the second LMP was a 1:13! Two LMPs later
	     I got a 1:11, which I uploaded. The next day I got this 1:09 and
	     two 1:10, the following day my best was a 1:12, that's why I think
	     that I should recording because it becomes too time expensive.
