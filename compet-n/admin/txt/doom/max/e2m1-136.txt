Description:

Hmm... I can't really get my episode 2 max movie right, so I figured out it
was more fun to try this single map rec instead. This map is absolutely great
for maxkills playing. I believe that under 1:30 is possible within the limits
of the Doom engine, but is it possible within the human limits? I think not,
so "human optimal" should be about 1:31-1:32. Really annoying that the Caco
before the exit needed 7 shotgun blasts to die. Normal is 5-6 blasts, so I
lost about two seconds there. Also I lost a sec on the imp that blocked me
at a teleport and the imp just before I got the red key. Btw, exact time for
this demo is 1:36,82.
