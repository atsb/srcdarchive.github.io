 Description: Shotgun and Pistol totin' "B*ST*RDS" everywhere, they
 should have named this level "The Western Station". Although this
 is a fun and simple level on "UV", when you add the "fast" setting
 remember to put on your bullet-proof vest.


 PS: I believe in giving credit where credit is due. Players such as
 "SW, UG, DL, AK, MK, S.;-)" and all the rest of those competing in
 this "competition". I have been able to beat some very good times,
 thanks to the .LMP's these guys have made.


 PPS: Thanks to Blake for the help in E1M7.
