  Description :

  Some other players tried to beat my old records (40s and 38s) of this
  level. So I decided to finish this battle. After 2 years and 5 months
  practising this level I made an ultimate attempt and got a 33s recording.
  The exact time is 1188 game tics or 33.94s.

  I don't see any real improvements (down to 1154 game tics) any more.

  The par time (30s) is out of reach.

  In this recording I use some interesting fighting strategies:

    The first sergeant (who gives me my shotgun) is nearly dead as I arrive.
    I shoot him with the pistol from the distance. I kill the two sergeants
    above with one shot and don't get the gun of the left sergeant.

    In the room after the first door I don't hesitate but run forward. The
    last sergeant near the exit survives!

    In the room before the level exit I shoot the sergeant and the barrel
    with one shot. This kills the imp and all of the soldiers on the right
    side too.

    The elevator trigger line is too far away but my friend the sergeant,
    who survived, triggers it. The imp shoots him for me.
    I was really surprised as I first realised that this sergeant is able
    to trigger the elevator.

    The last part is full of "diagonal run". I use it even in the exit room.
