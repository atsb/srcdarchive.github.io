  Description :-) It might be possible to do it close to par, but that
  means that everything must work in your favour (luck, aiming, speeding
  internal fights etc.). I usually get around 3:15-25 on average, I have
  played it for 2 hours now and I have not been close to 3:01 again, it
  is a pity since I had hoped I could do it under 3 minutes and surely
  there must be enough mistakes in my 3:01 that if corrected could have
  made it into under 3:00.
