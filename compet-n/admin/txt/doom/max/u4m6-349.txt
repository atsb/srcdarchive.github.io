Description:  This lmp is entirely dedicated to Esko, he mailed me this 
              wonderfull route today. IMO only one thing is anoying with
              this map- there are xx too many lost soules!! Except from
              that its just great...The first time I saw that key-trick 
              in use, was in Rinis awesome NM lmp, though he said Esko
              was the one who originally discovered it.
