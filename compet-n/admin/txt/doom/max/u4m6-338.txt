  Description:  Well if this doesn't get you back to compet-n, Anders,
                nothing will :) Seriously, this wasn't hard to get, and
                there's heaps more juice to be squeezed from this level
                still. Demo is only okay, with the red key grab needing
                three tries, and cybie taking too long to kill. Using
                plasma on the first group of enemies saves plenty of time.
