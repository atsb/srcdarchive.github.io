  Description:
	
	I saw Yonatan's demo at 0:52 and after doing 0:44 to 
	normal exit I thought I could do it with Secret Exit
	(because secret route is faster than normal in pacifist)
	
	Sorry Yonatan! :)  But I don't understand where you lose 
	so much time! My time is no perfect because I lose time 
	at many places so I think it could be done in 0:36 or 0:37 ?
