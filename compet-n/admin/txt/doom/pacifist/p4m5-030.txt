Description:

Nice, this pacifist is one second faster than Ddq time :P
At least I hope this entry is real pacifist style, watch
the part with pinkies properly, I dont think I hit it.
(I will save some 31s runs for reserve rather :P) 
Btw. that seemigly needless punch helps by the end, 
dunno why but it works and everytime I did it I was succesful.
