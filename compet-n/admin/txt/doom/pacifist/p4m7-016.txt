  Wow, this was easy! Costed only 2 tries to beat Peo's 0:19.
  I was afraid that it wouldn't be valid because of the strafe-50,
  but after checking Peo's demo and the speed record, I knew I had
  the right to use it. What is wrong with strafe-50 anyway?
  It's only strafe-running with the second mousebutton pressed...
