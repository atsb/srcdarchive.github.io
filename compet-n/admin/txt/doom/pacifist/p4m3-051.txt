E4M3 finished in 0:51 Pacifist style!

It's not that hard to survive the exit area without
the soul sphere. I tried for 20 min and got several
1:01 finishes, then suddenly 0:51. Everything just
went right.

Well, being shot down to 40% health at the blue key 
usually means you're going to die but amazingly I 
survived.
