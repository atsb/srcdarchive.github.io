  Description :

New to the tables. Can't quite see why this hasn't been done before...it's
quite a hard run, but no harder than some doom2 pacifist runs. This is
pretty fast. Main problem here is the corridor full of enemies - emptying
it and making sure nothing gets in it and blocks your run back from the
yellow key. Red key room isn't actually too hard.
