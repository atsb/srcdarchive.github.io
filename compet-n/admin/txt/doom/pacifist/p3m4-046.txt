Yeah, you're right Vince, actually this could probably go to the same time as,
or even faster than, the speedrun record - it's just harder. There's a story
behind this one...I have a fairly old records.txt (my personal dump of the
compet-n records) file, which still has Andy Badorek's 1:00 as the record for
this level. I thought "ah, that should be easy to beat", and went about it
using the id-intended route, and got a nice 0:54. I was just about to write
the text file when I noticed Vincent's 0:47 lurking in my Doom dir. After
stabbing another few pins into the Vincent-doll I keep on my desk for
emergencies <you should've seen the stabbing it got when he made e1m9-029>
(only joking vince! <stab> <stab> stab>), I went out to do it with the
keygrab, beating Vince if at all possible. Managed it on my first finish.
This isn't a great run, and there's a couple of screwups after I grab the
key, but hey...it's a new record, and it beats DDQ...:).
