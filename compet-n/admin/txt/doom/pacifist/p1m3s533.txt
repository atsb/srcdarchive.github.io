  Description :)

  I was looking for some stuff to do and thought I'd try this
  one.  Not many people like to do these slow pacifist demos,
  which is a shame because they're quite fun.  This demo is
  far from optimal, but I think that a speedrun style demo
  (under 1:30) would be a TAS only project.  I hope you enjoy
  watching this as much as I did making it.
