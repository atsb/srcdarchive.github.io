  Description :-)

  I  *think*  I've seen this done in 0:06 already, but I don't know
  where ... on the other hand, <CooLMP.EXE -LastUse> shows 00:07.74
  even when only running to the blue box and pressing the space bar
  once, so I *might* be just plain wrong as well ... ;-)

  I *did* include a .BAT with this, 'coz  S.;-)  takes good care of
  all the newbies out there. :-)  However, I'm convinced that every
  serious LMP'er (like Anthe and me) has a highly-sophisticated one
  of his own to handle this stuff - right? ;-)
