E4M3 finished in 0:45 Pacifist style

I had to improve my previous time of 0:51 because 
I didn't like the route. Those 6 seconds difference
are about the time you waste waiting for the bridge
to the god mode.

I still don't know if going through the red door is
faster than the jump. Depends on the monsters at
the door, I suppose.
