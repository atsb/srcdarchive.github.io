  DooM - Ep.2 Mi.1

  Time  00:39.97
        --------
        MMH - 1%

  Description :

YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!
Jesus fucking Christ! This run has taken me over 10 hours of solid playing to
do...at a conservative estimate, 700 runs at the level...:). Only problem now
is that, though i'd never have believed it two seconds before this run, i'd
even say 0:38 is possible! I was _slightly_ slow going through the pack of
pinkies - maybe 0.1-0.2s there - and I was slow reaching the teleporter pad
to the exit room (although through no fault of my own, it's a miracle I
actually got there at all) - that loses probably around 0.7s, and the other
0.1 is just possible by improving the running. I'm not gonna try it though :)
Oh yeah, note the "MMH - 1%" below the time there...I got scratched down to
1% trying to get past the imps in the second-to-last room :)).
