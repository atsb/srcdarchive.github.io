E4M9 finished in 0:14 Pacifist style

I used the jump invented by Yonathan Donner
in his speed demo. This saves some time.

Landing directly on the ledge (first jump) is 
possible but very hard, especially when you're 
facing the other direction. If you do land on 
the ledge the cacodemon WILL be in the way.
There's no point in trying.

I really hate this level. The two jumps are
quite hard and the cacodemon is a pain, too.
