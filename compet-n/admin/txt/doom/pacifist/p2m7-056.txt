  Description:

Free interpretation     : E2M7 - 0:56 dance in next level, par time 4:00 !!!
                          Thanks to Andy Badorek for this route.
                          The non-pacifist record time is 0:45.
                       
                          In case you miss it in the mayhem: the point is to
                          get the yellow key without the blue key.
                       
                          Using this route for pacifist is as hard as the
                          hardest Doom2 pacifist levels. I was lucky in the
                          end, usually there are more imps and demons
                          blocking the way back to the exit. That's the
                          disadvantage of this route... but it's fast!
