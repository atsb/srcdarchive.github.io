   Description:  
  
   I like playing pacifist, but I don't like when those bastards
   are blocking me. Especially in a situation your shotgun is
   ready and some fucking monster is staying in your way and you
   mustn't get it down. I nearly screwed up this demo, cuz I really
   wanted to get that shotgun guy staying in front of the teleport 
   (I had been already very annoyed by the spectre in the previous room)
   but my brain said me "later...later....you will smash him!". 
   Fortunately i'm quite patient, so after I recorded this demo, I 
   played it again, but with IDKFA and you should've seen those bastards'
   heads flying all over the rooms....:)
