  Description:

Hmmm, bit harder than 2:40. Should really go for a full speedrun style run...
do the lift trick and do the end speedrun style...hehe :). Had some grief
getting the pinkie down the stairs near the blue key to come out here, if
that hadn't happened and if i'd speeded the end up a bit, could've gone under
2:00. Ah well. Gets very dicy near the end, hehe...
