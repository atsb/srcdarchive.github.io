Description: I had to record something, too. It's improvable of course. 

I don't know what to say other than thanking Creaphis for starting the glide thread and Grazza for remembering the old thread about this.
Never knew this before.

Four and half years later! Thankfully we have cack_handed who doesn't agree with all this "impossible" nonsense! This glide and cack_handed's
unreachable exit switch trick really blows my mind. What is it, 17-year-old game and still this kind of amazing stuff comes up?
