  UltraViolence - Pacifist

  E1M9

  Description :  This map is really fun to play on pacifist. I tried to
		 follow Yonatan's route (if you haven't seen his fantastic 
		 recording p1m9----.lmp, watch it NOW), but in more than 20
		 tries in which I reached the switch leading to the blue key,
		 I never was able to run through that crowd of demons like
		 Yonatan did. So I changed the the strategy and lure the 
		 demons away from the blue key. The maps isn't too hard if you
		 play it this way.
