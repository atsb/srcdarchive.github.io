  Description :-)

Well, I didn't even get to see Oyvind's 2:00 before beating it...sorry :).
This demo interesting mainly because it has a slight refinement to my pinkie
corridor technique - by getting two pinkies hit you can increase the odds of
getting through to around 1/10. Got nicely lucky at the imps on the way back,
and would've been under 1:50 if that caco hadn't blocked me later on. Gr.
