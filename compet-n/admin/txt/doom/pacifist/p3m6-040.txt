    Description: Yes...
		 The short version of the long story:
		 I tried this level on Pacifist some months back, 
		 and got a horrible looking 3:12. Some time later, 
		 tried it on NightMare and got a 1:24. And after a 
		 few optimisations, got this. 

		 This level is a lot easier on NightMare. The imps and
		 cacos take down the Spectre MUCH faster, and you
		 get more time with the invuln. Also, with the imps 
		 continually firing at you, they hold their place and you
		 can slalom them easier. I take the blue key 
		 first as this is the part you need the most luck for.
		 The other passage is E-W level and you can dodge 
		 through it without much trouble.

		 What would be nice would be a UV recording of this level.
