Well, what can I say?  I guess the God of DooM was smiling on me today! :)
It seemed to go wrong at first, with the imps refusing to move out of the
way, but I handled it pretty well.  As for the marble area, I don't think
you could wish for better monster behaviour, and to top it off, the lost
souls went perfectly as well!  Its theoretically beatable, but you'll have
to spend a while to manage it.
