Good run Vince :). I thought some of your running was a bit bizarre though...
this route through the maze is far less hazardous, and i'm buggered if I
know why you stood around starting a fight in the red key room :). Thanks for
the route into the last room though, although I wouldn't say getting past
two imps and a pinkie in a corridor about wide enough for 1 1/2 people is
*easy* :). The last room is sheer luck...you just have to have enough sarges
and imps alive to stop the spectres and pinkies attacking you as you worm
your way through. I really don't think it would be a sensible project to beat
this run...I mean, it's obviously possible, you could probably do 1:30 or so,
but it's such a hard run there's easier points available elsewhere. I wouldn't
have taken this on unless i'd done p1m6-232, if Vince had come up with 2:09
before I did 2:32 i'd've left it alone...it's a very frustrating run.
