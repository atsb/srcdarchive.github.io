  Description :)

  I tried a strategy here to make the spiderdemon the main
  target of the baron and a cacodemon, everything was good
  here except the baron was too late to connect with the
  spiderdemon, with that happening sooner it can go under
  1 minute for sure. Also the other cacodemon who was
  targetting me missed some shots, that can go better.
  This was fun btw :) GL to anyone trying this
