                    Time  0:33
                          ----

Fucking hell this is quick! The record stood at 0:48. So I first made a 0:47.
Then came the first big revelation to me...firing an initial shot removes
one of the lost souls in the maze from your path. So I got a 0:39. Then I
sent that demo to Aurikan, who commented that you don't actually need to grab
the blue armour. So I got a 0:37 without it. Finally, he showed me that you
don't have to go all around the lost souls - if you're lucky you can slip
between them and the pinkie into the corridor with the humans. So I tried at
that...and finally got this incredibly lucky demo :). Main two lucky things
here are that I got through on the inside of the cacodemon, and the exit door
was already open and the spectre had been alerted when I arrived, which saved
at least two or three seconds. This is only two seconds off the speedrun
record...I don't think it'll be improved too soon :)
