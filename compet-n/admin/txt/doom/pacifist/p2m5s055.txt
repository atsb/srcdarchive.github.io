  Description: Lucky

  I really don't know where this came from!
  I was looking through the pacifist table when I spotted the
  old secret time for this level.

  "That seems a bit slow," I said to myself and I loaded up the
  level.  Anyway, after a few tries I was having trouble getting
  the pack of demons out of the switch room.  This attempt was
  just a practice at first, I was just messing about (which is why
  I start opening the doors in the marble area) and suddenly I
  managed to get the switch and complete the level in 0:55!

  I guess I was pretty lucky with this one, but I haven't bothered
  trying to optimise it.  I expect a 0:45 is possible, probably less,
  so what are you waiting for?  Go for it! ;-)
