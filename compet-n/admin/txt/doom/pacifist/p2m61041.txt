Description:    Much easier than I had expected. I could even change the order
                I take the keys, normally the yellow one first. And you could
                show you to the Baron, he will be stuck behind the Pigs :)
                It's not as easy as a permanent Invulnerable map, but also not
                that difficult. It's the 3rd attempt here, played it for less
                than 1/2 hour to complete it. You need some luck at the red
                key, but not much. Just plenty of health here, I wasted a lot
                and survived anyway.
