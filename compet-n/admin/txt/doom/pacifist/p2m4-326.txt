[ Taken from Sam John Stephens D1M exam d1m-sjs.
  It is the first (nearly) pacifist recording of e2m4. As this recording is
  older than the rules for playing pacifist style, I consider it a valid
  pacifist's lmp despite the (ab)use of the crusher. ]

Free interpretation     : E2M4 on UV without shooting/punching once!

The free I thought of when I heard some guy had recorded a wad of completing
episode 1 on skill 1 without shooting once. Having seen e2m4 done Tyson, I
decided that it would be be a good level to try without shooting. This level
has very few groups of clustered baddies, which makes things simpler.
