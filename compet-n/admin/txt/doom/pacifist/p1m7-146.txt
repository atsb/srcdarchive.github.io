C-N entry #191.

Definitely wasn't worth the time
invested into it, but at least it
got me off of pacifist runs for a
while. :)  Credit to AdamW for
being the first to bring this run
under a half-hour, improving the
original p1m7 (33:08) by Steffen
"Rini" Udluft.  Yeah, only two
total entries exist for this run
and now, I can see why.

This is luck in its most evil form,
so GL to anyone wishing to try their
luck (or looking for a brutal lesson
in humility).  Tons of great runs were
ruined right before the exit but I
don't care, time to focus on more
satisfying runs. :)
