		 He's right you know.
	
		 Ummm... I didn't really want to upload this LMP, as it 
		 looks REALLY BAD, and I've done a much better recording 
		 in Nightmare. But Nightmare Pacifist recordings don't 
		 get points, or so says Adam.

		 So here it is. The worst excuse for a Hall-Of-Fame entry 
		 ever.

		 It's possible to do this much faster. This demo came after 
		 about three or four hours, and I play it as safe as possible.
		 A time of 1:30 or less is possible, but you need immense luck
		 in the blue key room. I know because I did it, but wasn't 
		 recording :( The imps take too long to kill the Spectre, and 
		 they clog up the passages.

		 So... don't watch this, watch P3M6-040 instead (if you
		 can find it - it might be in the MISC directory) 
		
		 (P.S. somebody please beat this record... do it soon)
