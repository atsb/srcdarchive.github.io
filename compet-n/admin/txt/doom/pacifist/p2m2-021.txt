  Description :-)

  "Cheating" my way through this Mission...

  Killing NO monsters - Collecting NO items
  And finding NO secrets - Except for one !

  It is possible to activate the end bridge
  switch from the lower slime pool, Through
  The Wall !! ;-) This fabulous "cheat" was
  discovered by Steffen (DIINM) Winterfeldt
  - see his most excellent EP2-0615.LMP for
  it's first recorded use... But note that,
  This, is Still MY level :-)
