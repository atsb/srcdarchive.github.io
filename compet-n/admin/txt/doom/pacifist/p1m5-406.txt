  Description:

  My strategy for this lmp was to play the start fairly quickly, and the
  end fairly slowly. The start is dead easy the way I played it. The
  map only starts to get a little tricky once you get to the blue key
  room. I copied Rini's strat of teleporting the bad guys away, but didn't
  copy his strat of running into the tiny room with 2 pinkies in it :-)
