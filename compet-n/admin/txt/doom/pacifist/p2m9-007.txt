  Description :-)

  Okay,  so y'all think that pressing switches through walls  (like
  E2M2 or E3M6) is hot stuff, huh? Yawn! (read: YAAAAAWWWN!!!!! :-)
  Wanna know what's REALLY HOT STUFF?!! Okay, I'll tell ya: getting
  the yellow key through a solid metal door locked with the red key.
  'Big deal, so what?', I hear you say ... well, the point here is:
  I DO NOT HAVE THE RED KEY!!! You don't believe me?!? Quit reading
  right now and watch  THE .LMP  -  then come back here afterwards!

  See? I told you! Hehehehe ... ;-)  Well, this definitely explains
  SataniC's extremely weak time of 0:12 (ROTFLMAO! ;-) - I *always*
  wondered why the heck he insisted on grabbing all three keys. <G>

  Oh, I almost forgot: "Sorry, SataniC!" :-)  - BTW this trick *is*
  repeatable, it's  *not*  a once-only engine bug or the like. Just
  try it a little  (preferrably with -nomonsters),  and you will be
  able to do it, too. It also works with the red key, but you won't
  get a 0:07 time then ;-) - Oh Gawd, I LOVE this buggy engine! <G>

  I *did* include a .BAT with this, 'coz  S.;-)  takes good care of
  all the newbies out there. :-)  However, I'm convinced that every
  serious LMPer (like Anthe and me) has a high-sophisticated one of
  his own to handle this stuff - right? ;-)
