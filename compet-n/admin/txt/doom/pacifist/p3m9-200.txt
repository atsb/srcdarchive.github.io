  Description :-)

  A while ago, I was looking at the point tables, and I
  noticed that E3M1 was not yet done in Pacifist style.
  Wondering what was making the level impossible, I started
  discussing the subject with Chrozoron, soon taking my
  questions to #nightmare as well. When I later had to leave,
  people were still debating the issue. The next day, I was
  quite amazed to find p3m1-055 and p3m9-203 in incoming... :)

  My only improvement over AdamW's (legendary ;-) run is that
  I let the cybie clear the way through the imps before I start
  heading back to the start of the level.
