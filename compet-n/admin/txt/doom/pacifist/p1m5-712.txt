  Description: I did this because it was stil missing in my private
               collection of UDOOM - pacifist recordings. Now only
               P2M6 is missing, but I propably won't be able to beat
               Andy's record there. In fact this recording is no record
               either - Andy told me that he has finished it already
               in less than 6 minutes.

               Hi Andy, now you can upload your P1M5-5?? w/o beating
               your own record - isn't that nice?

               A very entertaining map to play pacifist, I enjoyed it.
