  Description:
	
	Nice level, not very hard to do pacifist.
        Two hard points :
           - the imps and the lift : most of the time the imps block 
             the lift.... here the lift got up exactly between 
             two imps !! :)
           - the second switch house with the shotgun guys : the first 
             is not really a problem cause i stay a few second in front 
             of the lift switch... so the guys can leave free the way to
             the way to the switch they keep. Here i telefragged a guy...
             not even a shot in the back... easy exit ! :)
