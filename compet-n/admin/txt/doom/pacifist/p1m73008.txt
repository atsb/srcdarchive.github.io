    Description: From the time I recorded p1m3 I knew that p1m7 must be
                 possible too. I had one try almost reaching the red key,
                 but this demo, not even reaching the red key, already
                 lasted for half an hour and so I decided that it is
                 absolutely crazy to keep on trying ...

                 ... but I could not forget it and a month ago I tried it
                 again. To my surprise everything was much easier compared
                 to my first tries - and much faster.

                 In fact it was even FUN. (I know nobody believes this ;-)
                 And then finally I made it the whole way, and if you watch
                 it you will see that it even looks rather simple.
              
                 Use -timedemo or dtime /e to watch that recording,
                 unless you are a complete pacifist freak.

                 Now there are only very few "out of the base" maps left
                 in COMPET-N:
               
                 ep4-nm         the D1S challenge
                 t4m6           the ultimate tyson challenge
                 pa29           the ultimate pacifist challenge
                 pa17           "impossible"
                 pa26           "impossible"
                 t4m7           maybe even harder than t4m6
                 t4m2           this is definitely easier than t4m6 or t4m7
                 pa02           is this really not possible?
                 p1m6           the one I would try next (if I would try any)
                 p4m1           "impossible"
                 t2m9           who wants to try this?
               
                 Most of those will propably never be completed,
                 but I'm pretty sure that some of them will.

            BTW: I did not mention p3m6-normal_exit and pa15-normal_exit,
                 because IMO recordings which are only done to the other
                 exit don't have that flair of someting completely new.
                 But with Panters try in mind I think that pa15-normal_exit
                 is more likely to be done than any of the recordings listed
                 above.

            PS: I consider p2m9, p3m1, p3m9, p4m6, pa07, pa30, ty30
                not even possible when using all cheats you can think of.
