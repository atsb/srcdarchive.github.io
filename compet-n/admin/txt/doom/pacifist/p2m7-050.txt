E2M7 finished in 0:50 Pacifist style!
That's just 5 seconds above my non-pacifist best.

I couldn't believe my luck when I came back to the exit area and found no
monsters blocking the small door. Previously, I had loads of ultra-fast
near-finishes but I always got trapped trying to reach the red door which 
triggers the bridge to the exit.
