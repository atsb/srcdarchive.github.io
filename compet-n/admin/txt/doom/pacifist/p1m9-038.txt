  Description :

I got 41s after a few min, with a slow calm run. I needed 30min for this one.
Main improvement here is that I don't go for the two medikits. This allows me to play a bit safer.
This is my second successful try ... I had many good ones ending in the blue key room .. u gotta be 
lucky with the pigs there.
