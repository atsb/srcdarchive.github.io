    Description: There is a trick that sometimes works well, you take about
                 50% damage but the second room clears itself, then if you
                 can get the sargeants in the first room to attack imps and
                 not you it makes it very easy.

I just catch the last imp in the doortrack and let the human shoot at him
and then they fight and if the imp didn't win, there's more imps to use
by the blue door.  To get out of the staircase area, i find the spectre tends
to the right, so i strafe left around him at the last possible moment.
With the soul sphere, i have enough life just to run through the rest of the
map and I think I could do it without the soul sphere but I didn't want to
screw it up.

One more hole is filled on the pacifist chart.

I wonder if my aggressive start could be used to speed up the normal exit
record? I think so: get the soul sphere and then speedrun to the blue key
and back. Then pick up health and speedrun to the exit.  Estimated time:
8 minutes or so?
