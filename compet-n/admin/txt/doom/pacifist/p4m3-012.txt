  Description

    Very many monsters guard the way to the red key... well, they
    can keep hold of it if it makes them happy :).
    Some hundred trys and binding  [strafe-on] and [right] to one
    key made this possible. After all the years Doom exists it is
    still possible to find new shortcuts,  that is one reason why
    we all love it, right?                                    .ac.
