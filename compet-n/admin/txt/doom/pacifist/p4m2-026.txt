   Description: Mmm.. Looks like I really like this level :) In fact I wasn't thinking about optimizing this one, but Adam sent me a mail telling me that I used too much strafe50 (of course he was right :). So here's a new one, 3 sec faster, and where I use a bit of strafe50 only for the jump, I think (it's really hard to do it fast -before those ****** cacos block you- w/o it). Hope I'll be forgiven.
 Look at the last room sequence: it is nearly perfect in this run but, believe me, I got killed many times there :)
Hey, it's the third time I optimize this map, I think I should try smthg else :)
