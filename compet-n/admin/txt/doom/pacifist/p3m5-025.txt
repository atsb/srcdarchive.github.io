  Description :-)

  I was sure I could do it... Previous record by Andy Badorek is at 0:27 !
  
  I've equaled the records of both routes of this level.
  First I saw Yonatan's route and equalled his time (0:26) in 30min.
  Adam's route was harder, it took me about 1 hour.	     	
 
  Adam thinks that 0:25 is unbeatable, so I hope it's my first 
  everlasting point!

I attached two demos : - new record in 0:25 (Adam's route)
		       - old record in 0:26 (Yonatan' route)
