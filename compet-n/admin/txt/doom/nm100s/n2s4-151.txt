  Description :-)
 
  Well I still think 1:50 is possible... this is a low 1:51 but
  I don't wanna spend more time on this now.

  Maybe you could try another level now Adam? There are still
  plenty to beat. Just grab one, watch the old route, learn it,
  steal it, copy it. Sit down and beat it by one lousy second.
  Don't mention anything in your text where you took the route from.
  (That'd be giving respect, but who cares?)
  Isn't that your style of play Adam, is it?
