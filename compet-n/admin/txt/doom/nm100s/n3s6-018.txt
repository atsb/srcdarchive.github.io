  Description :)

  This is an easy run to complete in Nightmare relatively
  I had at least 50 19s before this.

  Never thought I could get 18s without shotgunners breaking
  the stuck after telepoting.
  Strange enough it didn't happen here so I didn't have hope
  for 18 but FYI the tic in which I activated the exit switch
  is the tic in which I activated last secret and is the last
  tic in 18s!!! Seriously check it in slow motion with prboom+
  This is amazing I couldn't beleive it at first. What luck!

  I'm very proud of this run =)
