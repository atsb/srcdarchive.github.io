  Description:  A very nice map for the nm100s cat. I get all secrets,
                take all keys and end with all weapons (afaik).
                Ok, it would be more stylish to take the initial
                shotgun from the small hidden room and not from a
                dead sergeant. (IMO you have to take the initial
                weapons to be a real weapon-collector)

                This is my first successful try and I hope you enjoy
                watching me running without too much of a plan.

                To speed up that map one propably will leave the chaingun,
                make better use of the BFG, leave the soulsphere and finally
                perform Adam's key trick.
