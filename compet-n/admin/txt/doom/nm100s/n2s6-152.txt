  Description :)

  As you can see I tried to do this one just like my nm
  speed record, without waking up the pigs, but it takes a
  lot of luck to keep both doors closed when you need to
  get through the corridor.  I didn't get it this time, but
  still managed to avoid getting killed by all those monsters
  on the way to the exit.  They slowed me down though, so a
  good time would be around 1:40.
