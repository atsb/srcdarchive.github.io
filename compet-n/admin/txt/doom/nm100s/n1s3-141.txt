  Description :-)
    
  Could be better, could be worse. I missed some shots in the
  supercharge room, and the pig blocked me which caused me to
  not make it under the blue door. This is 8 seconds faster than
  stx-vile mostly because I didn’t take the yellow key. There are
  no secrets past the yellow door, so all you need to do is step 
  in a little ways, which saves several seconds. It’s a little
  harder to survive this way, especially if you want to take the
  risk of leaving some shotgunners alive, in order to get back
  before the blue door closes. Also, I use mostly chaingun while
  stx-vile uses rockets. I don’t know which one is faster, but
  using rockets looks super risky and seems somewhat
  counterintuitive. Because of those time losses, I think a time
  of around 1:37 would be quite possible.
