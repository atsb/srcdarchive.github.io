  Description :-)

  Hmmm... this LMP isn't any good, many mistakes here and there.
  Still it's okay because it's the first n1s9 and also my first
  NightMare! recording of this level.

  I wouldn't say this is as hard as many think, I just watched
  the demos by Donatas and Jan Endre (credits to them for the route
  and all the moves), figured out where the additional secret is,
  and sat down playing. I needed 13 tries to make it to the exit.
  I really don't want to bring people down with this, but I feel
  e.g. E4M1 or even E1M7 is harder in NM than this one.

  One more to go...
