Unusual case... Dash was checking the
tables and noticed that the :19 seemed
strangely unoptimized.  Of course, that
sometimes can be deceptive and improving
it can be much more difficult than it
first appears, but not this time.  Dash
tried it for a while himself... before
he did so, I checked the database to see
if the table was accurate and an :18 run
wasn't being displayed on the website,
but that wasn't the case. :)

Anyway, this is 18.66, so there's plenty
of time to spare here.  It's reasonable,
also, that 17 seconds is possible here
with an extremely quick elevator drop,
but the luck needed for that isn't worth
the trouble.
