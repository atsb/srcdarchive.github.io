  Description :-)

  After watching Rini's demos I realized that his route is much
  easier and plannable, and because he didn't do the 2:30 I hoped
  for, I gave it another go.
  I got under par and under 2 mins too, and it's repeatable.
  With this route this map is not that hard as I thought, I'd rather
  call it easy now than hard.
  I got some shaky BFG moments here and there (my finger got stuck on
  the left mouse button :) so there's still improvement to be done.
