I wasn't expecting that time at all. I was
trying a different route for the last room
and got really lucky here since a spectre
I didn't see got owned by a barrel. The RL
is needed if you want a good time, chaingun
is just too slow and risky with all these 
pigs behind you ready to eat your butt.

I think below 1:30 is possible but should
be pretty hard. I'll go for it. Maybe.
