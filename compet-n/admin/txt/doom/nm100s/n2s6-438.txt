  Description:  I like styles where you really have to PLAY Nightmare -
                not just run through. I'm not sure whether the 100%
                secrets requirement is hard enough, propably it will end
                as speedrunning category, just like ordinary nightmare.
                Anyway, I did this nice map, before someone does,
                who hates it and I enjoyed it. Hope you enjoy watching.
