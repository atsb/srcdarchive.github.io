  Description:  Damn the start!

  If it wasn't for the difficultly in getting the sargeants
  to block the door, this map would be easy.  Once you've got
  the chaingun and the Soulsphere/Mega Armour you can cruise
  along until the end like your playing UV.  The final room
  isn't so tricky if you've got over 100% health, you just
  blast away with the rocket launcher.  I make a bit of a mess
  at the very end however, due to a shotgunner picking a very
  annoying time to respawn causing me to take a rocket in the face.
  Still it can be done a lot faster than this, probably around
  2:00.
