Not an easy one. I started trying this after watching
Adam's :39. I saw that a few things could be done faster,
especially to trigger the secrets, and got :37 quite
easily. I was satisfied with time until I saw on the
CFD-N tables that JC had done :36. So I watched the
UV and NM speed entries (with an awesome human-built
demo by Sedlo as always) to get some ideas and got
back to work.

This route is quite luck based, since the ending is
totally random (and frustrating). If you manage to go
for the jump without stopping to be in the line, you
can still have a monster respawning or moving in your
way screwing up your jump, then have pigs with their
asses already all over your face and if you kill them
you just loose too much time, then miss the second 
jump for the same reasons, and finally have monsters
sitting on the exit, which isn't dramatic but still...

In the end, i'm quite happy with this demo, the time 
is good, :32 is possible but should be hard, I won't
go for it for sure! So, good luck!
