1:50 possible?! I wouldn't think so! Closer to 1:53 with a good run, IMO.
This is a pretty boring level to try and optimise, took quite a few runs...
countless 2:04s and 2:03s, and three 1:59s...got there in the end tho.
This is more or less a pure speedrunning level, it shows up little errors
in your running to a terrifying degree :)
