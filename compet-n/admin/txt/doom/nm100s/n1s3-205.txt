Yeah, that's right, 2:00 is certainly possible, but very hard. The first
section of this run is hard to survive. The rest is pretty easy, but there's
lots of places to get stuck and lose the odd 2 seconds, and it all mounts up.
The only thing I do much different from Vince is to go into the last secret
quicker - after the key door I don't bother clearing all four sergeants, I
just run for the secret. I find infighting tends to occur quite quickly, and
i've had this tactic work with as little as 33% health...so don't be scared
of it :). Can't wait to see what you come up with Vince...
