  Description:
	
	I wanted to do nightmare secret exit for PublicDANG. 
	And I got a 4:42 with 100% secrets which already beats 
        6:00 by Anthe.
	But I saw Anthe did it in 1996. So he could have done 
	a lot better.
	
	Some parts are really slow so maybe 2:30 would be 
        an optimum here.

	Strange that Adam W. hadn't tried it, after he did n1s1
        n1s2 and n1s4 ?? Is it too hard ?
        Nooo... :) Only the beginning is a bit hard. When you get 
	the chaingun nothing can go wrong... :)
