  Description :)

  This didn't take much time as I thought it would
  I tried a different approach with the pinkies at
  beginning, it was good enough in here :)
  I got loads of luck with spectres, you can see
  I was very confused in there trying to survive
  WHILE killing barons AND not huring spectres :P
  after I saw a baron die then 2nd one just after
  him so fast "O M G, I must not fail this jump!"

  I thought I'll lose 1 second with much health left
  but after teleporting enemies devliverred a
  bullet barrage and exited instantly 
  What more luck could I possibly want ???
