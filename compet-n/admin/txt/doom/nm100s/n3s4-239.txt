  Description:  Very funny, Adam did the map at the same time I did,
                and I was my recording was ONE second faster.
                Sorry, Adam, I had no time to watch your recording yet,
                and I did not reach the 2:30. But at least I followed
                my plan and skipped the chaingun and the soulsphere.
                Unfortunately the map gets less interesting w/o the
                soulsphere, as the BFG-soulsphere rom is the most
                interesting one in that map when doing nm100s.
                I got very nervous at the end with a demon biting my
                back - see my shaky hands ;-)
