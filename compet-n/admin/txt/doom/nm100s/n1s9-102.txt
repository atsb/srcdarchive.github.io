C-N entry #106.

I saw that Radek would have liked to see this
one under 1:10, so I checked to find out if my
unskilled twofaced ass could do something about
that. :) I use the movie route here and improved
the time, little by little.. and ended up with
my average time in an e1ns attempt (my best being
1:00, but that's also without the extra trip to
the rl/rockets room)
