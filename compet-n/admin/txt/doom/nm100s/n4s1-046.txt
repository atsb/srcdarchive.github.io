  Hmm i don't think so. I hadn't too much problem with this one.
  If you manage to grab the key quickly it's possible to finish it 
  quite often (i never performed the key grab so quickly !). 

  In fact the only secret here is to go as fast as you can. 
  Unlike many other maps, it's almost impossible to play it slowly. 

  The only difference with NM speed is when you wait for the floor 
  to lower : so that's approx 5-6s ? Add this to my NM speed time 
  (0:41) and you get this (0:46).
