Description:  After getting the nightmare record I decided to go for the 
              nm100s. This was much easier for some reason, and I got this
              after half an hour. Even with the secrets accounted for, this
              is much slower than n1m5-150: at one point I forgot my route,
              using the chaingun on the first line of soldiers/imps, then 
              turning back to look for a nonexistent demon :( I think I 
              slowed down a little after that.

              Prediction: If everything works alright, this could go under 
              two minutes.
