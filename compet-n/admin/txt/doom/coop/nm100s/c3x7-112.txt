Altima:  After 2 days of work on this demo, I think we can both say that this
         has been the funniest coop demo session we've ever had. Just...how
         many times did I die at the start anyway? Dunno...could've been at
         least 50 times ^^' Anyway, under Hegyi's NM100S time is great =) We
         had one exit that was 1:15 but Ogre missed the armor secret. Luckily
         we picked up everything this time. His route is more important here,
         as he picks up more secrets. And his is harder, dodging all the demons
         and such...but hey, at least we got a successful exit!

         We included a few bonus demos for our frustrating (but funny) work ;)
         And I swear...I have to have killed Ogre more in this recording session
         than I have in deathmatch playing! Enjoy ^_^

OgreSlayR:  Wow, finally damnit! God I cant count how many fuck ups we've had.
            This isn't the best looking demo or fastest, but I'm sure Altima
            and myself aren't too concerned with that. Specially because all
            the fuck ups but the bloopers were funny. :)

This demo was recorded over Microsoft Gaming Zone's IPX-Zonelan.
