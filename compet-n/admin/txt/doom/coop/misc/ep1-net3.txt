  EP1-NET3.LMP - Whole Episode on Ultra Violence

  Introduction :-)

  This is a Three-Player .NET'worked .LMP -Record'ing of the whole of
  DooM Episode One. It was -Record'ed many moons ago, way back in the
  days of Version 1.666, just before my team of "trained marines" got
  disbanded. Sniff :-( Anyway, this still works with DooM Version 1.9
  and also The Ultimate DooM - IF you use the included PWAD file :-)

  Originally...

  Recorded using DooM Version 1.666
  And Converted to DooM Version 1.9

  So

  By
  GO-VER19.BAT
  OR
  DooM -PlayDemo with Ultimate DooM
  IF
  You also add "-File E1M1-REG.WAD"
  By
  GO-UDOOM.BAT

  ie. Using the included PWAD file:

  E1 M7  -    22  22 100.   16  13   0    46. 54.  0      6" 45
  E1 M8  -    ??  ??  ??    ??  ??  ??    ??  ??  ??      2" 30


  There were NO deaths due to monster attacks but there was ONE team-
  FRAG-ging - of Brown by Indigo on E1 M2 :-( so he did patiently lay
  dead until "revived" on the next level. It was kind of like calling
  in the, "reserve", fourth marine ;-) Reasons L8R...


                                          Total Time =   35" 260
                                                         35" +
                                                          4" 20
                                                         ------
                                          TOTAL TIME =   39" 20   Approx!
                                                        --------

  These times were ESTIMATED by taking an F1 .PCX dump at the end of each
  mission and comparing the time-stamps (right down to the seconds field)
  and assuming that the wait between missions was about 20 seconds - BUT,
  since the TOTAL playing time is just 38" 01 - "these times" were rather
  OVER estimated...

    [ 39:20 + 2:20 (waits) + 0:45 (at end) lots greater than  38" 01 ]

  So, IGNORE the TIMES - This is just a DEMO.-nstation .LMP after all ;-)


  Description :-)

  ... Slow - But Good ...

  The original intention in -Record'ing this .LMP was to have a good
  run through of an entire DooM Episode with NO marine deaths at all
  ie. Total Victory over all of those Demons :-) Anyway... We didn't
  Quite make it... But it was SOOooo close!


  This .LMP is Best re-Play-Demo'ed over a .NET'work - put a copy on
  Each of three -Nodes already set up to play .Net DooM and run...

  > IPXSETUP -Nodes 3 -DevParm -PlayDemo EP1-NET3

  ... on each -Node. This way you get to see the interaction between
  each of the players, and in "real" time :-)


  OTHERWISE - Be sure to view this .LMP from *Each* one of the three
  player's Point Of View. It is worth doing this as that is the only
  way of viewing each players status bar and also *Hearing* the game
  play from that player's position. (Using F12 is just plain silly).

  Use some thing like Raymond Chi's most excellent "LMPUTIL -Viewer"
  to switch between these different POV's. Hmm... Maybe I'll include
  that particular utility in this package too.


  This .LMP contains some pretty good and some pretty silly moments:

  I could write a fairly full description of each marine's adventure
  but I've probably written enough already - Just watch, OKay ;-)


  The main "Mission Orders" were "Don't shoot each other - Share out
  the power-ups - Stick to your routes - AND - Be careful with those
  Damn Rockets !!!" - OKay!


  Now then, it's time for a...

  Challenge :-)

  Can YOU put together a Crack Team of marines and record a Storming
  of either Episodes Two or Three ?? That is, a complete -Record'ing
  of the whole of an Episode, beginning to end, on -Skill 4, with as
  few deaths as possible. If/when a player gets killed - then he (or
  she ;-) Stays DEAD !! - Until "revived" on the next level. This is
  kind of like being replaced by a "reserve" (living) marine...


  The One Hard "Competition" Rule! - 1 of 1 :-
  If the Time Taken Can NOT be Clearly Seen - It'll be DISqualified !!!
  So,
  Please wait 10 to 20 Seconds at each and every tally (or text) screen

  Except for "Rule" 2 of "1" ;-) Please, - Absolutely NO "PAUSE-ing" !!
  Modified to...
  No excessive Pausing, any more than 1*3 or 3*1 min Pauses - Auto-DISq

  AND now add...
  "Rule" 3 of "1" ;-) ABSOLUTELY NO RESPAWNING! Auto-DISqualification !


  The Next Challenge :-)

  The next challenge, will be IPXSETUP (Multi-Player) -Record'ings of
  DooM II... IPXSETUP -Nodes X [ -Skill 4 ] -Record'ings of DooM II -
  Levels 01-10 (That should be easy enough) OR ANY single level above
  10 (As that is where it begins to get really "tricky!" ;-) With the
  same three "Rules" as above...

  I'll start this of with a (lame? ;-) -Record'ing of Levels 01 - 10.

  See the .DOC included in my "NET1UV01.ZIP" for this next challenge!
