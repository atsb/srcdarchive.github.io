  Description :
  

  [ JC : ] 
  
  Really hard map, I understand very well why nobody tried it before x) 
  We aimed to get under 2:30, and finally made it ... even if some cacodemons kept travelling randomly in the map D: !

  [ Ch0wW : ]
  
  We managed to make the strats from scratch, and to be honest, it was a very nice strat JCD made ! 
  but, for the rest, it's hard, especially when to SAVE bullets, and kill that FILTHY cacodemon that is hidden 99% of the time ! CacoSurprise !
