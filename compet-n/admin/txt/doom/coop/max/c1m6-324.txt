Dark Friday: Whoo, well, been there, saw that, fragged it. BTW, yeah, i almost
             killed my fellow player behind the yellowdoor/supercharge :))
             With a rocket yeah :) Damn i was lucky :) He never noticed it in
             the game, but he could heard me wispering "move forward, move
             forward" and holding my breath :) (5th demo of the 2-sept. day btw)
      

SlagDooM:    Hehe, if I had knew about that rocket flying towards my ass...
