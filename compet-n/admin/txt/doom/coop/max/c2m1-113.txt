Dark Friday: This is the 4th demo of the 2-sept. day, well, it's ok. In the
             beginning i jump into the imp-mass, to pull a switch, not my
             playstyle, but hey, slag needed that switch fast to continue his
             part. And at the end i'm lucky that slag is a patient doomer :)
             I strafed in front of his SG 3 times i guess :) If the roles were
             inverted, i would have hit him 3 times :)
      
SlagDooM:    Old record improved by 40 seconds. :)
