OgreSlayer : Hmm, decent run, I guess. We tried alot of different routes 
             and this one worked nicely. We got alot of 1:14,and 1:15.
             Lag makes it a bitch. Pretty fun map for max overall.

Vincent : Lag makes Shotgun aiming quite crappy so I preferred to use 
          Chaingun. Be sure to watch Ogre's great run, he looks like he's 
          playing on a LAN :). My part wasn't very hard, I just had to 
          check monster presence in different areas and get to the 
          chainsaw secret b4 ogre exits => something that can be achieved 
          without much problems.
