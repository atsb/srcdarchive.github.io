Dark Friday: I fucking hate this level. It took us 2 hours, and we made it to
             the end about 10 times, of witch 9 where with monsters still alive.
             (Of witch 8 times the same imp :) well, he got his share of the
             BFG :) (6th demo of the 2-sept. day). Never gonna play this stupid
             map again :) (BTW, i do a lot of back-checking just to see if there
             was another imp alive somewhere... you'll never know... :)
      

SlagDooM:    My favourite map, despite the 99% kills in 99% of all attempts.
