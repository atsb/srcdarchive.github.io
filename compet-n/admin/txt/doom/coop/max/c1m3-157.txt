Dark Friday: Well, the beginning sucks, the rest too :) But hey, it's a record :)
             This was the first record of the 2-sept. day. I enjoyed this level,
             although on all the tries, this one, on my part, sucked the most
             of all those tries. Damn, why was this try the record? :)
    
SlagDooM:    Great coop level, because the players can split up 2 times.
             Fragcount is very low when coopping this level. :)
