  Time:    2:31.45


Slag:        Our goal was to improve the solo record by 1 minute at least.
             Didn't cost too much effort, cause this map only has imps, demons
             and some lost souls. Under 2 minutes might be possible...             
      
Df:          Quite funny map, no real hard monsters or situations on it, the only
             danger is getting stuck between imps. Had better runs on this map.
             Also got fucked at the barrels, I usualy don't shoot them, saves some
             time, only this time, i got a jumpy barrel, that was just ready to
             explode in my face :) That piggy at the end really got in my way
             when i got the rl.
