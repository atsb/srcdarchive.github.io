OgreSlayer : A pretty fun and easy run. The lag seemed better than usual. 
             I Had quite a few screw ups but its kinda hard not to screw 
             up on a 160 ms ping on microsoft zone."

Vincent : My part is a bit crap. The lag was bearable but still it affects
          moves quite a lot. It's still nice to play coop ... :)
          I guess a 1:29 would not be too hard to get on LAN.
