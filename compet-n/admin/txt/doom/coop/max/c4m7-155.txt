Chris	:	A few parts of this are really depressing on my end. You must keep
		in mind the 160ms of lag, and the fact that my monitor is dark. Even
		with the highest brightness setting, the blue sphere room is pitch
		black to me. That's why I was shooting at the wall. Bad combination.

		Anyway, as I'm sure most of you know (because he's a Doom whore) Vince
		is a lot of fun to coop with. Very skilled, and capable. He came up
		with the route, and I fucked up my bit in parts, but what can you expect.
		I'm used to being able to comfortably go through the route slowly and then
		as I'm playing make random varations on it. No room for this with poor
		Vincent having to restart every time I test something stupid. So I tried
		to play relatively safe. If we were at a LAN I'd be quite a bit more
		liberal on this front, and probably throw pizza at him if he complained.

		Maybe mints... which ever.

Vincent : 	nice to cooperate with Chris, we played a lag around 160 ms 
		which makes this not so good looking. Otherwise we struggled 
		a bit to break the 2 mins... Route is good but I guess 1:3x 
		would be excellent without lag.
