Dark Friday: This was the 3rd of the 2-sept. day. Well, it was perfect in
             my point of view, being modest :) Halfway, while slag was moving
             towards the barons, he turned around, and start shooting the pinkies,
             (costing me ~45%) so i shouted "your pumping me full of lead!!!" and
             he stopped, and we toasted some barons butt. This was the only try
             that i didn't (forgot :) the chaingun, apperantly that is better :)      

SlagDooM:    Everything went very well, so I decided to make things a little bit
             more exciting by shooting DF a bit. :) 
             Anyway, we just played until we got a sub-1-minute demo.
