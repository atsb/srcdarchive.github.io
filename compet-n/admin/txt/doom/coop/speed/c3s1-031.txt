  Description:

   The Cacos were damn annoying, they blocked one of us all the time.
   Everything went perfect in this demo, and I even didn't kill Boltonie
   in the exit room. 30s is definitely possible.

  Two shotguns in the corridor saved the time here, I also like this part
  the most. I agree with Radek, 30s ... sure.
