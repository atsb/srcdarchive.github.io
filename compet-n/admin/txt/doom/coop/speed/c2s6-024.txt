  Wow ! I did not think we could get a good time on this one tonight ! I made the void glide on my first try, but took some time to hit the switch at the end =/
  22 or 21 is possible.

  [ Dislogical : ]
  
  This one's pretty hazardous. JC has to make the void glide really quickly, and needs to hit the ending switch within a few seconds to get a good time. 
  24 seconds is not that bad, but I guess this could be lowered to 22 with some more tries.
