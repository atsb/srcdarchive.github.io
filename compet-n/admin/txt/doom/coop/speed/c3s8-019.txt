  Description :-)
  
  [ Waldon: ]

  Not a big thing. Adam had a nice run up there, my rockets
  just helped him.

  [ Adam : ]
  
  Hmmm, nice cooperation. Waldon doesn't really need
  to go fast because he runs out of ammo fairly quick,
  so it's my time which will count. This way he has a
  little time for shooting rockets (so the spider
  follows him not me).
