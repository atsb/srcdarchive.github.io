Selim   : Hmmm... You have to know my role was crucial here ; I had to 
          shout : "Go on, Vincent ! Go on !" so he could make a good run.
          Since I shouted louder than he did when I was playing, he got 9s
          before me ... Am I not great ? :))
Vincent : We tried that with nomonsters and got 9.77... 20 ms, that's 
          enough room to run around monsters.
          So we alternatively swapped the runner's place :)
          Because the other hasn't much things to do since it's pacifist.
          We needed about one hour to get it. 
          The nightmare challenge should be harder since the monsters move
	  a lot less. Maybe in that mode the 2nd player can help to take 
          off monsters on the way.
