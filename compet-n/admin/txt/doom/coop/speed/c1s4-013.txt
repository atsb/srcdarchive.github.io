Selim   : 13s isn't hard to get the normal way, but with the boost it's more fun ;)
          My run sucks here btw :P And don't listen to what vince says afterwards ...
Vincent : Nice stuff by Selim, he really owns this map. With Adam Hegyi he's the only 
          one who got 12 in nomonsters.
          And It's definatly not pacifist... we kill a shotgunner  so that I can grab 
          his shotgun and then help Selim to jump with a little shotgun boost.	
	  I wonder if 12 is possible in coop ? Maybe Adam Hegyi hold the answer...
