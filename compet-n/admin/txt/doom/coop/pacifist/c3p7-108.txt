Altima:  Everything sort of fell into place in this demo, Ogre missed the
         jump but it gave me time to run back for some much-needed health.
         Telefragged one Demon, but he got in the way, not my fault! ^_^
         Thanks Ogre, I couldn't have done it without you!

OgreSlayR:  Well,what can I say,I could of done better,no doubt about
            that.But I'm happy with this time for now.Thanks to my coop
            partner for doing good;-) Keep it real!!!!
