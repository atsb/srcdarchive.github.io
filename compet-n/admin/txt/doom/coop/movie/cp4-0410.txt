Gusta:  Very funny experiece :) Two days of work. We did some previous runs even throgh
        Map 6 but we ruined up map 7. Our trip through map 8 is pretty funny here because 
        we have never played it before. Nice when we couldn't find that first secret room.

          
Method:   OK.Now all episodes of UD have czech players.:)
          Very funny map e4m8 where we can't find secret in start sector.In this map we were           very very nervous.I mean this is solid run but has a lot of wrongs.In map 7 is           timer.exe des. so we must stoped last map on clock.
 
          !!!Enjoy!!!
