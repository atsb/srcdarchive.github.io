Description:  Internal fights are the key here. I tried several routes, but
              ended up with a rather slow one. The first minute can be hard
              to survive cause of the gunners. But after a while, when you
              get control over the map, its only those bloody soules that  
              you have to worry about. Havn't watched Andys 06:XX yet, maybe
              he had a better way through...
