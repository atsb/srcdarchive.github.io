Description:  Hmmm...just got a call from Henning whome have downed the 
              latest Compet-N stuff. Lots of new tysons and pacifist, 
              Compe-N is more alive then ever!! :-)
              So, here comes another one from me. Someone have to do these
              none-berserk things, so it might as well be me...A fine cut
              from Patricks 21:16, but boring as hell anyway. I have died
              in the last room coupple of times, ones I also fired the SG 
              right before exiting!!
