Description:   Claudio said he liked my old t3m9. I thought it was too shaky,
               so I made another one for him to enjoy :-) Frustrating note:
               Once I left the cyber scene still immortal. Barons fell like
               flies with the key, all except one who did me in. Lmpc said 
               5:06. A pitty. This is medium to slow in most scenes.
