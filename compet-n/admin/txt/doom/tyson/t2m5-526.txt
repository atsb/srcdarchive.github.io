  Description :)

  I must admit Radek's 5:43 was not at all easy for me to beat,
  so I'm very happy with the time I got here.  I changed my
  methods here a bit.  The most significant one is that I grab
  the invis and punch out those imps and sarges by the saw.
  Perhaps it can be done without invis, which could save a couple
  of seconds.  Other than that most of the rest of the level
  was quite cooperative.
