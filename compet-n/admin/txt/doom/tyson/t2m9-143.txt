Description: This map is nothing but luck when played Tyson...WHY did they
             put a damn chainsaw here instead of a berserk?! Does anyone
             really like that rusty (NOISY) thing anyway? A pitty I didn't 
             attack the last baron/caco sooner, but I didn't know they were 
	     so low on healt...Sorry Donatas, but I'll defend this one now.
