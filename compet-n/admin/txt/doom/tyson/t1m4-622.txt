Description:  I had promised myselfe to leave it with three maps today...but
              there was nothing interesting on TV right now.
              I'm beginning to really enjoy this "new" cat...only a slimm
              improvement, just used the barrels better, and changed tactics
              with blue-door (Patric fought the pigs in the maze, I choosed
              to create some IF out in the open). Got a bit low on healt
              in the end, almost ended up as a pig-burger too....
              Ok, now I'm done for today, promise :) Lets do the rest of
              episode 1 tomorrow. Then its on to the REAL tysons with berserk.
