  Description :)

  Hmmm, interesting that Radek didn't beat Anders record
  before.  At first when I played it I died a lot, but now
  I don't have much problems.  You'll see I am low on health
  a lot, but I usually have a little more health.  I played
  this one pretty much all out, and with a few mistakes I
  got this.  I could definitely see a 5:30 or less here.
