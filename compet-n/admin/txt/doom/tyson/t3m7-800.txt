Description: Ohhh - terrible! Time sux, lmp sux, map sux...Guess it won't
             take long before I'm forced to repeat this.
             Below 07:00 anyone? Rini? Must be my worst tyson together with
             e2m1, another one which I hope will be beaten soon. Only way I'll
             get myselfe to play them over again, is if anyone bother to beat
             them :-)
