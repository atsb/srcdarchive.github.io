  Description :-)

  13 seconds faster than Oyvind, wanted to make sure
  there's more to it than the exit jump.
  
  Employed some new tactics here, trying to get both
  barons near the barrels to maximize the damage on
  them by blowing them up. It needs some luck and time,
  so I'm not sure if it's any faster than pistoling them
  in that period.
