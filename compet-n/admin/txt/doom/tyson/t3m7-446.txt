  Description:  Luck's a fortune sometimes. I had a few sessions at this
                over the past few days, and after getting a 5:02 early
                on decided I wanted it below 5min. But this didn't happen.
                Plenty of 4:xx's with one monster left alive, plenty
                of +5min finishes, no luck.

                Today I sit down and straightaway, first shot, get this.
                Of course being a first demo I wasn't really warmed up,
                and as such this demo is ugly as all fuck. But still,
                32 seconds faster than Xit.
