  Description :-)

  I didn't make the exit jump in this demo, so I really
  didn't expect the time to be this good.

  The only other sub-2:30 attempt I've had was a 2:21.91,
  the -exact- same time as AdamH's old demo :)

  (btw, sorry about the few gametics after strafing right at the
  end, I  guess I was sloppy with moving in the endroom because
  I thought it was a sucky time)
