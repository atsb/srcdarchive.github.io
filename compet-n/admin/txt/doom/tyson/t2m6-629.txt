Description:  Next Tyson is done! This map is great for it, a lot of pigs,
              imps and next animals. It's also very easy to die here. It
              happened to me a few times that i died just before the exit,
              'coz the last Baron killed me.
              I'd like to thank to Cladio Barba. About two weeks ago he 
              told me that i should to do some Tyson, and it really wasn't
              bad idea, right ? :)
              The route credits to Anders Johnsen.
