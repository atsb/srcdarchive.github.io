  Description :-)

  I really don't like that exit jump :P
  (although I made it this time :)

  When working on the first demo, I had in fact been thinking
  of staying around to help the barons down the stairs, but I
  kept getting surrounded and ripped apart, so I abandoned the
  idea. Thanks to Adam H. for showing it could be done :)

  I was lucky enough to only need 4 bullets for the first demon
  pack, and I had no waiting time in the exit room either.
