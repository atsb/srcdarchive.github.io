  Description :)

  I thought up a new route where I save the medikits and supercharge
  and skip the blue armor but it turned out that was inadequate
  for me to beat Radek's record, so I simply used his route except I
  skipped the armor.  I made a mistake at the end but fortunately the
  quality of the rest of the run was good enough to get this time.
