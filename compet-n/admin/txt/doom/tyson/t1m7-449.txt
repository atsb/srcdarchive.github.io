              First of all - thanx for beating my 06:13 Rini, it sucked :)
              I've done more like that one, so if you want to make me cry
              again... :-) I did not put much effort into this new one
              either. First try I had entered in 05:36, so I thought, lets
              skip something and at least bring it below 5 mins. 
	      8-10 tries later I got one with 100% kills and this time.
              Your'e right about below 4 mins Steffen, more sawing
              in the garden would help reaching that time. Gotta go and
              study now...so maybe another day :-)
