Description:  Jaaaawn.....Urrrg...*sigh*...
              My first Tyson. Episode 1 is probably the most boring maps there
              is to play tyson. Just fiering that old rusty gun around 1000 
              times. In general I like to watch good tyson-recordings,
              and my heros within that cat. are Daniel, Peo, Patrick and Esko.
              I will try to finish most of Doom1 on tyson, time will tell if
              I'm stubber enough to do so. Looking forward to the maps in
              episode 2 & 3, all of them have nice berserks layin' around.
              Hmmm...actually this is my second tyson ever, I did Doom2 map32
              long time ago...slower then Hennings new one though :-)
