Description:
C-N entry #48.

This is my first tyson entry, so you can tell me whether I suck or not.
Thanks to Radek for the route, nice demos from you and Xit too. :)

Personally, I'm very satisfied with this run, so I'm glad I continued to play
after getting a 4:32 and 4:26 (This run was rather addicting.)

Also, I'm trying to concentrate on my current movie project, so don't expect
me to start recording a ton of tysons. :)
