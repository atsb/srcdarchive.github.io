Description:  I dind't watch the former record of this map, just played.
              I'm sure there is a smarter way through, basically I just 
              find something and knock it :-) Pretty tense ending, my
              playing is quite lousy those last mins. But I was lucky             
              with the pig-knocking in the beginning, many of them died
              by only one hit.
