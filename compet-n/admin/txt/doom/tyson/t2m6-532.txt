  Description :)

  I guess Radek didn't like my 2 second improvement for f2m4,
  so hopefully he'll like this better.  This would be quite a
  fun level to play tyson, except those cacos are very annoying
  in the supercharge room.  Sometimes you can punch a caco out
  without taking a hit, and sometimes it does 100%+ damage.
