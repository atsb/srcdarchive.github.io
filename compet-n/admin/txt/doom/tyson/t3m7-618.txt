  Description :)

  My first exit and already I'm more than a minute faster than
  Radek.  I definitely didn't expect to get this time.  When I
  finished the map I thought probably there was some monster
  left somewhere, but it was only lost souls.  I have no clue
  what a good time on this map would be.
