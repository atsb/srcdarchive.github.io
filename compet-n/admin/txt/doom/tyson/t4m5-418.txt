  Description :)

  Thanks for the route Anders.  I made a few changes to it.
  The main difference is I use a different route to and from
  the blue key.  I think this may be slightly faster, but the
  main reason I did that is so I don't wake up the baron until
  later.  Normally I would take the radsuit, but this time that
  caco looked like he would not let me there and I thought hey,
  there's berzerk down there so whats the big deal if I lose
  health in the slime there, and it worked.  Anders demo looks
  slow to me, but it's not really that easy to beat.
