  Description:  The old record was way too slow.
                So this improvement of only one second
                won't be in the list very long either.
                Most of the top players will easily get
                under one minute. I am looking forward
                to watching those demos.

                Now it's 2:34 AM. Have to get up for work
                in four hours. But getting a compet-n record
                is worth a day walking around like a zombie...
