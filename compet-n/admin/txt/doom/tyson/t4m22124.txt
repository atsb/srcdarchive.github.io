Description: And another undefeated task bites the dust. 
	     Didn't use any tactics from Kemplings Tas demo really.
             Played this inbetween doing other stuff, its superslow, did it
             to have some fun - not to work my ass off. Watch with
             -timedemo and some nice midi, have fun :) Mmm well, dunno
             about that. You gotta really love this game in order to
             enjoy tyson...but at least it was fun and relaxing to do 
	     (usually have a pillow ready for those infights, think 
	     you should as well if you are going to watch it).
