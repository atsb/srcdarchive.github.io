  I heard Henning and Sedlo were fighting over this record, so I
  thought I should improve it.  It isn't too hard, but it's hard
  on the hands.  At one point I had to hide behind a pillar while
  I shook my hand.  Even so it feels like your fingers are going
  to slip and hit the wrong key.  Thank goodness for joy_b speed,
  otherwise I don't think my index finger could have stood it.
