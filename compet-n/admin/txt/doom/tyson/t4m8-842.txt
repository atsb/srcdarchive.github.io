Description: A beauty of map...only a pitty the .lmp do not match :-) 
             It seem to be one of the less popular levels at Compet-N,
             probably cause its a "end-map". The damn spider was just too
             effective in the end, and all the barons gatherd in the wrong
             part of the room. Those spiders are powerfull creatures for 
             sure...Btw, that's another one below 10 mins - full route-credits
