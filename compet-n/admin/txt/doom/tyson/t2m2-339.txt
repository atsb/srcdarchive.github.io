  Description :)

  Finally I'm done with this fuckin' level.  I also managed to
  get a 3:33 with 99% kills, so I'll probably defend this one.
  I use 2 tricks on this level.  The first one is to open the
  door just after getting the berzerk.  I noticed that the
  door stays open forever, so you save maybe half a second
  because you don't have to open it later.  I also incorporated
  Demonlord's exit jump, so credits to him for that.  Without
  these 2 tricks this would have taken longer to get a record.
  Route credits to Radek Pecka.
