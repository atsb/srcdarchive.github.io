  Description :)

  Only one second faster than Radek :(  Anyway I don't like this
  level cause there's too many of those shotgunners.  With a
  supercharge available near the beginning I think this would
  be a fun level... It's just too easy to die especially before
  you get the armor.  I think I may have used an inferior route
  than radek, cause my demo seems to be pretty good, except for
  losing time at the switch.
