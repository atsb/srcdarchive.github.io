  Description :)

  At first I thought this would be damn hard, cause I thought
  it would take much luck to duplicate Anders methods at the
  beginning, but I used my own strategy of shooting the cacos
  and then having them shoot as many imps as possible without
  killing them.  It could go a bit faster, cause I needed to
  waste some time and pistol ammo since the monsters killed
  the last cacodemon too easily.
