Description:  Damn I hate Anders :). All his demos look really sloppy but
turn out to take quite some beating :). This was 15 to 20 attempts, I think.
At least I got all the secrets :). Same route I used for max and -fast
records. I actually forgot about the chainsaw the first few times I tried
this tyson run...I managed a 3:18 without using it :). Anders' demo was a
2:58.
