Description: I've just changed settings of my mouse, so now it should be
             optimal for playing Tyson. I had a few demos in time about
             8:30, it was very slow. Then i changed the route a bit and
             got 7:59, but with 99% kills only. After a few next tries i 
             got this one. I'd like to know why is always my fastest demo
             also the ugliest ? :)
