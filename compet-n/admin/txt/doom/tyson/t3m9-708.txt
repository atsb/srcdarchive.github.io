  Description :)

  Sorry, keyboard demo.  I thought I would try this, and I
  don't think I'm skilled enough with the mouse to play this way.
  I've practiced all my kung-fu stuff with the keyboard and would
  have to re-learn it to do this.  As for the time, well I know
  it's not that great.  I think 6 minutes or less would be pretty
  good.
