Description:  Crappy looking .lmp, but it has its share of luck. Peo's former
              record has 100% secrets, this is the same for all his (and DL's?)
              Tyson-recordings. Patrick Martin on the other hand, do not care
              for the secrets...but I think my time would be slightly faster
              even if I had wissited that last secret. I have not read any
              tyson-rules yet, just watched how the other guys do it. I hope
              100% secrets are unnessesary?
