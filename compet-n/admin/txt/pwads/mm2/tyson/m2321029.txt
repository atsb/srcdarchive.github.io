| This time I got three exits (12:52, 10:29, 11:29). Apparently no luck  |
| with breaking the 10 minute barrier. The third demo was wimpy, but     |
| interesting, as for the first time I still had bullets left after      |
| killing the cybers.                                                    |
|                                                                        |
| I also tried m223 Tyson again, after a six month break. Got to the     |
| megasphere for the first time. It turns out this map is more difficult |
| than I thought. When playing with savegames from the point I died, I   |
| had extreme trouble with pain elementals / cacos. Not sure now if I    |
| ever beat that map.                                                    |
|                                                                        |
| When watching using PrBoom+, you may use -trace_thingshealth 146 147   |
| and cyberdemons' health will be shown if HUD is activated.            }|
