  Description :-)
    
  First exit. It’s really tough to survive to the exit playing
  like this. That one chainer by the first switch is a jerk.
  He won’t stand there and let me shoot him without shooting back.
  I think the chainer infights went well, and I had pretty good
  health and ammo near the end. The infighting with the imps and
  pigs rarely goes as well as it did in practice.
