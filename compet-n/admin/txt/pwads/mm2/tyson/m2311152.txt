Description: An initial entry. My first COMPET-N tyson entry also.
	     Very sloppy playing, especially the beginning.
	
	     One of the best from MM2 and also one of the best doom
	     e1 style wads ever. Orin rocks. Fun and easy map for Tyson.

	     Hey Dashiva, how's mm2 31 pacifist going? =D
