==============================================

I could raise some objections about this level (which has never been my favourite), but instead I will concentrate
on its good points:

1) For any kind of run (speed, max, casual), the room with 2 hell knights, imps, sergeants,
PE and some demons and spectres waiting behind the bars is just perfect. It is all about "how to put
a moderate set of monsters and really threaten the player". I had a lot of trouble with all these monsters
until I recalled the Xit Vono's speedrun and I realized it is possible to sneak past the demon&spectre horde.

2) Although the beginning is pretty slow (lots of fist fights due to notorious ammo shortage), Eric Sargent
put 3 ammo boxes on the player's way and they appear RIGHT WHEN THEY ARE NEEDED.

3) The final battle - 3 barons and 2 hell knights is a real climax of the level for Tyson runners. Fun, fun, fun!!!


Quite an ordinary run. One mancubus confused me a lot. After picking up the megasphere I made just as
many mistakes as I was allowed to.
