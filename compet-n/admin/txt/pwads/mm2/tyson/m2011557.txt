Description:

Ok, this level does NOT have enough health to do this properly!! Also....1%
health is not NEARLY enough to shoot a Chaingunner with!! And....neither is 5%
to be shooting anything with a gun for crying out loud! I basically stayed low
on health once I got past the first set of Chaingunners, my life just went all
to pieces >.<

The Demons weren't that hard, but I was kinda shakey from having such low
health and still getting past the Shotgunners and Chaingunners. Also, I just
wanted to make sure they didn't eat me. I also go back and enter all 3 secret
areas so I could make sure I had 100%.

I know I'm not a really good Tyson player (this IS my first Tyson run after
all), this run showed me that as well. At least I have a Tyson to claim as my
own now ^_^
