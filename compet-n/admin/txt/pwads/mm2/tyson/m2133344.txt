| I watched my private TAS (this MAP13 Tyson), recorded back in 2009 and |
| my conclusion was: there was nothing impossible in that run - so let's |
| go for it! This was probably way easier than z0diac's pt09 but for me  |
| personally it was the most challenging Tyson map. But hey, what did I  |
| expect? The easy, medium and hard slots for MM2 are taken, only        |
| "insane" ones are left :)                                              |
|                                                                        |
| It's a long demo, so you have more than enough time to understand my   |
| strategy while watching. For less experienced watchers or players, let |
| me summarize what I am doing in this demo. Once you have the red and   |
| yellow keys, you may pick up a chainsaw. Once you have all three keys, |
| you may get the berserk, blue armor and a comfortable surplus of       |
| bullets. As there are Pacifist recordings on MAP13, you may think      |
| rushing to the berserk is the best option. It is probably the fastest  |
| strategy for TAS, but in order to increase your odds of survival, I do |
| the things in a different way. Let's see.                              |
|                                                                        |
| I take the red key using Oyvind's window jump shortcut. Before         |
| proceeding to the yellow key area I try to reduce the monster count    |
| without using my own bullets; I am especially happy if the revenants   |
| are dead, as you don't see their rockets until they're very close with |
| low screen resolution. The yellow key area is a sort of a lottery,     |
| this was the luckiest time ever, as the baron was dead. An interesting |
| thing about this area: monsters can teleport into it, cannot teleport  |
| out; once you're there, you are safe, no-one teleports in sneaking     |
| behind your back (thanks to the position of this area in this automap).|
| However, when you are busy in the berserk area or near the exit, they  |
| choose one of two teleporters, behind the RK or BK door, sometimes     |
| making the YK area very, very crowded. After taking the yellow key I   |
| clear the beginning areas a bit more, then go for the blue key, awaken |
| one of the mancubi. Before going to the berserk area behind the BK door|
| I try to get rid of as many monsters as possible - now I have the      |
| chainsaw, so it's easier. Again, luck was on my side, only two hell    |
| knights were left (I knew I had to deal with them at the end). Then    |
| it's getting the berserk, not getting killed by chaingunners, going    |
| back to the start, activating the soulsphere switch and killing all    |
| the remaining monsters in the map. I decided to go for the arch-vile   |
| before the hell knights... the original strategy was to stand and wait |
| until the vile dies from him own splash damage. It didn't quite work   |
| this time :-/ Somehow I managed to survive and there were not many     |
| monsters left after that.                                              |
|                                                                        |
