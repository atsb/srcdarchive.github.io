Description:

I always thought there was not enough ammo here. 8 boxes of bullets vs.
21 cacodemons + a few hell knights which were unreachable by fists.
It turned out that, thanks to the layout / teleporter system, I can
arrange many caco vs. hell knight battles. Next one will be probably
one of the following: m223 (tried this since 2010...), rt15 (damn BK)
or rt24. All of them are much harder than this one.
