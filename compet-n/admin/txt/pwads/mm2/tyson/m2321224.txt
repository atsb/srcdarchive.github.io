| Haha, almost everything is wrong in this demo, but I really must stop  |
| taking this stuff too seriously. There is my trademark mistake here    |
| featuring a message "you need a blue key to activate this object" :-)  |
|                                                                        |
| I'll try to get this below 10:00, but not today, not this month. If    |
| someone else does it under vanilla, I'll be equally satisfied and will |
| rather not try to beat their time. If you're afraid of cybers, watch   |
| my m232fai2.lmp demo: I managed to kill one cyber using only arachno-  |
| trons, unfortunately my keyboard went berserk after this.              |
|                                                                        |
| When watching using PrBoom+, you may use -trace_thingshealth 146 147   |
| and cyberdemons' health will be shown if HUD is activated.             |
|                                                                        |
