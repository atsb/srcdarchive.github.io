| I watched Revved's attempt at MM, MAP19. Then I watched my cheated     |
| "private" 54:xx run of another Michael Rapp's level, MM2 MAP17,        |
| recorded a year ago. I had serious ammo problems in that run, but my   |
| critical eye noticed a few instances of wasting ammo, so I tried this  |
| again.                                                                 |
|                                                                        |
| This is probably the most difficult Tyson map I recorded so far.       |
| Unfortunately, the demo is a bit wimpy and boring unless you love such |
| challenges and watching the player trying his best not to screw up     |
| anything at the end. Anyway, I reached the blue key about 20 times,    |
| the red key 3 times.                                                   |
|                                                                        |
