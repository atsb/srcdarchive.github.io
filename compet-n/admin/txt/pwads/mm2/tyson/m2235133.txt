===================================
Description:

While I was getting killed and killed, I thought it was very hard.
Now when I made it, I think it is medium... Bullet ammo is enough,
only health is a problem. The megasphere comes shortly after blue
armor, so after blue armor I go for some detours, sacrificing this
armor.

The trickiest part is the million pain elemental part, to do it I
let one PE alive earlier so that the lost soul limit is reached.
Cyber + arch-vile (at the very end!) seemed like a huge obstacle,
but I never got killed there. The archie helps, resurrects some
monsters so the cyber is weakened more than normally.

MAP24 is not difficult (block monster lines abuse), but boring.
MAP25 is insane.
MAP26 - don't know, but I had a practice run which gives some hope.
MAP27 - very hard, for blue armor you need SSG, which is not allowed
for Tyson. Plenty of arachnotrons also.

Old records:

none
