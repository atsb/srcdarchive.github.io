| Oh this is very boring. On the way to the YK there are 4 revenants |
| and a mancubus. First, I clear the initial room which later will   |
| serve as a "monster storage". Monsters can only enter through one  |
| opening (room exit) and I unlikely to get out, whereas the player  |
| has three entrances / exits at his disposal. "Block Monster Lines",|
| hehe. I lure the revenants, sometimes there are many imps, I use   |
| one to clear the imps and then I punch it to death. Anyway, I only |
| need the ammo for the mancubus, though I use it on lost souls or   |
| sergeants or imps as well, I don't have patience to conserve every |
| bullet.                                                            |
|                                                                    |
| I open one of the YK doors, the one without chaingunners. The      |
| barons sometimes follow me straight away, I try to make them       |
| infight against the revenants. The barons should win and stay      |
| quite healthy, because I will need them again... Anyway, I can     |
| pick up the only armor and slowly make my way onto the RK.         |
|                                                                    |
| Then there is the baron <-> cacodemon infighting, the satisfactory |
| result is that the winning side has almost no HP left. Then there  |
| is the dreaded fight against 2 pain elementals, which in my        |
| practice runs cost me time, health and ammo. I decided to go for   |
| the blur sphere and charge, this way I killed at least one of      |
| them. As you can see, I could not sit patiently behind windows     |
| and after some waiting I tried to kill the second one quickly as   |
| well, and my health dropped from 191% to 39% and I almost did no   |
| harm to the PE.                                                    |
|                                                                    |
| The BK is guarded by some hit point meatshields for which I need   |
| the ammo. At the end I had revenants and barons, so I tried to     |
| organize some more infighting, however one baron got to the acid   |
| area, from which it could not get out... But anyway, I had just    |
| enough bullets.                                                    |
|                                                                    |
| Highlight moments (the rest is zzzzzZzzZzzz...):                   |
| 21:20 Super lucky. Both baron and spectre caught me by surprise,   |
|       they "shoudn't be there..."                                  |
| 29:43 Releasing pain elementals                                    |
