| During my first assessments I rated this one as impossible (it has     |
| berserk - so what? - how to get there?). Then I recorded a TAS in      |
| 52:35, in which I spent like 8 minutes pressing these lion switches :) |
| and... forgot about this Tyson. This year I became more certain I      |
| could record it without tools. The first phase - killing all the imps  |
| using the lone hell knight - is actually easy and not *that* boring    |
| for the recorder (don't know about the watcher). What comes after      |
| berserk looks easy, but it is not because your only blue armor doesn't |
| last long, after that you have to rely on all those stimpacks.         |
|                                                                        |
| This first exit looks overcautious, but trust me, it was not an easy   |
| map for me. I had enormous luck with berserk damage in critical        |
| moments, such as dealing with the first caco in the red key area, or   |
| the hell knight it his *extremely* tiny compartment - after 45 minutes |
| of play! I guess the time can be improved by 10 minutes or so, but for |
| me it'll suffice, I'm just happy to fill another hole in the tables.   |
|                                                                        |
