==============================================

At first I though it is impossible, so I din't even try.
In between Pacifist runs I tried this Tyson and got my first exit (49:10)
almost right away. Then I couldn't finish it again for a long time.
All in all, I don't know how difficult this level is. It is longer
than MAP18, but definitely easier, with plenty of power-ups.
The chainsaw is pretty useless, as it comes too late, when most
of the cacodemos should be dead already.

Lots of mistakes, some luck, but it is understandable in such a long demo.
The biggest LOL of the mancubus in about (14:05). As you can see,
now I am not very afraid of punching mancubi, still I am not able
to fight against cacodemons with fists.
