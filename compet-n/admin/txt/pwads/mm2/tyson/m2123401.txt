==============================================

WARNING NOTE: very unusual Tyson run. I call it "pacifist Tyson", since some monsters must not be killed
too early (cacodemons and a baron). The beginning is fast, the monsters die like flies (there are only 94 of
them, including 6 lost souls). But when there are about 20 monsters left, it's SLOOOOOOW.
To really appreciate the demo. try to beat the level by yourself :)

==============================================

The inspiration came from the text file by Gusta which corresponds to his Nightmare 100% secrets run (m212s052.lmp)
I though it would go like this: "Go as fast as possible to the exit, but don't quit the level yet; pick up
the berserk pack and go through the level once again, killing everyone. It'd be easy since health items
are lying everywhere." But I soon realized that it was not going THAT easy...

The problem is, you won't kill every monster using fists. Your arms are too short too reach that revenant in the cage
or a baron on the ledge. OK, how about bullets? 50 at the start, 20 from the chaingun, 40 in ammo clips,
35 from dead former humans and 50 from dead chaingunners (as only 5 chainguns out of 8 can be picked up). 50+20+40+35+50=195.
Now to kill the baron you need about 100 bullets, 30 for the revenant, 100 for tons of imps and 70 for the arch-vile
(we'll discuss the arch-vile later). So, heavy infighting is needed, plus using the pistol only when necessary.
Let's see what we can do with each "unreachable / problematic" monster?

* 6 imps in a big cage in front of the first door. They can be killed by the cacos. Very easy, it happens nearly every time.

* 1 chaingunner on the left high above. If he gets into infighting, he usually kills my precious cacos, so it's better to kill
him with pistol.

* 1 chaingunner and 1 imp. If health is low and ammo is high, they can be killed "manually". Otherwise, don't waste bullets!

* 10 imps surrounding 2 barons. The barons cannot pass certain linedefs and the imps are too high to rely on them fighting with
the barons (possible, but risky = much health is needed). I prefer to kill the barons and allow another baron to kill the
imps, because he can walk more freely.

* 2 mancubi. One of them cannot move, so there is no big deal. The other one CAN be killed with fists, but...  there is very
little space to manoeuvre, so, to put it simple, it's best when he's dead. The nearby chaingunner can do the task, and I always
help him (see the demo). To spice the things up, there is also a caco which loves to interfere ;)
In case the mancubus kills the chainee, I call a baron for help later.

* 3 sergeants (one of them cannot move). The one which cannot move or shoot is actually the only monster which theoretically
cannot be killed by infighting. The other two sometimes shoot the caco and die.

* 1 chaingunner -> see "2 mancubi". All in all, it's better if the chainnee survives than the mancubus (70 HP and not 600)

* 3 sergeants high above, gathered together. In this demo they all died (I don't now who killed them). Sometimes 1 or 2 survive.

* 1 revenant. To be killed by a baron or a caco, with preference to the baron.

* 1 baron on the ledge with two torches. The bullet-waster. He rarely dies, but weakening him is essential and can be done
with cacos or even imps (the baron is a short-sighted one and likes to miss). When he is already fighting, you can shoot him,
so he can forget his last target for a while.

* 1 arch-vile. He can take some imp balls and also kill those imps (which are reachable but tricky, health is needed to punch
them). After > 400 tries I realized the arch-vile actually CAN be reach with fists, when he stands the closest he can to the
player. This demo shows at least 2 successful punches.

==============================================

OK, now knowing now the theory, let's see how it worked in the demo.

The sergeants did little damage (good). After picking up the yellow key I prefer to make my way through a very slim ledge,
but I fell down. No big deal, there is a teleporter which brings me back, I just don't want to telefrag the baron by
mistake. Before going through the yellow door I provoke a little infighting. Behind the yellow key door there is a typical
manoeuvre to kill the mancubus. Watch it carefully! The mancubus died (good). The caco survived (good). The chainee survived
(bad). Then, having obtained the blue key in the process, I run to the exit... erm, to the berserk pack.
I kill the caco (it's possible to telefrag him, but it went wonderfully in the demo, since I punched him to death
taking no damage! - it rarely happens). Then, another typical scene can be observed, "killing" the imps in the cage (at least
some of them). All of a sudden, a caco performs a glide :) (going through that ultra-slim door). I punish him for that,
because it's uneasy to bring him back to play. The next part is trying to kill the revenant and weaken the baron on the
ledge, while killing everyone else. I got hit twice by the rev, but all is well that ends well, both tasks were accomplished.
After clearing the area (more or less), I clear the area behind the yellow door as well, to invite the "mobile" baron
there, so he cannot disturb me when I'm busy killing the other two barons... The rest is simple: there is an arch-vile left + 2
barons + 1 baron + imps. I have plenty of ammo and health but, after many unsuccessful tries, I didn't want to press my luck.
When my health dropped to 24% (any imp fireball could kill me), I even decided to kill the imps below the arch-vile
by pistol. You can imagine how panicked I was. 

So, the time sucks but the demo shows it is possible to beat this level Tyson-style.
