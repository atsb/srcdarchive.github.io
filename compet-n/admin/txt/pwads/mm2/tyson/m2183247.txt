==============================================

42th time I reached the Berserk
23th time with the red key
10th time past the arch-vile
2nd time with the blue key
1st exit

Well, it's similar to MAP07 in the way there is a berserk pack in the middle
and many areas have to be visited more than once. However, this level is MUCH MORE
difficult Tyson-style because there is no armor. This basically means, with mancubi,
revenants and hell knights, that the player is constantly one or two steps away from death.
