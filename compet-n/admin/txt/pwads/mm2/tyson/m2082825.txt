| This was rather easy. I just overlooked this one. No berserk, no       |
| chainsaw, but three important assets: 1.Monsters fight among           |
| themselves without problems, 2.An important door behind the            |
| arachnotrons can be opened/closed by the player only, 3.There is       |
| bullet ammo everywhere. Perhaps even easier than MAP09, I needed only  |
| two hours for this.                                                    |
