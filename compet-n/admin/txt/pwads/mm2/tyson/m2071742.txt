==============================================

Some parts are ugly! The monsters did NOT cooperate as well as they were supposed to.
The three mancubi near the blue key can be killed without firing a bullet, without using fists.
Not this time... At the very end (mancubi again!) the doorbell rang (15:45), it distracted me
and I was lucky to survive, despite a few very unsafe moves...
