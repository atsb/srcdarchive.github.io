| Playing this map on Nightmare became my new addiction :) This is 10th  |
| exit overall, 6th after m201s200 and 2nd below 2:00. This time I had   |
| lots of health all the time, quite unusually. Equipped with chaingun   |
| ammo, I decided to break through the last horde straight to the exit.  |
|                                                                        |
