Description:

I thought about this run when I was doing plain nm demo for this map. But without sound it seems too hard for me then. Now I find that sound helps a little with the supercharge secret. I've been killed on the ledge leading to the charge by the cyberdemon five times in a row before I passed it through. So I was pretty nervous after this scene. First exit obviously.
