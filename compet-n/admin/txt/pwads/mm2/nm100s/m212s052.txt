  Description:

  My 20th Compet-N Entry...  

  ...crap, but I don't feel like trying this map a lot more. Maybe later?
  I realized going through that mass of demons is easier on NM then UV.
  The hardest thing here are two mancubis guarding blue key. I hate them.
  Maybe I'll try max or even tyson - Berserk is placed perfectly :))
