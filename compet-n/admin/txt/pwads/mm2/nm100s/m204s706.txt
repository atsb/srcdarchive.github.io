  Description :-)
    
  This was a fairly easy demo for me. It could probably be
  quite a bit faster, for example It should be possible to
  do the linedef skip twice, as well as not going all the
  way to the armor in the last secret. This demo is OK I
  think. I was sloppy in the first area, but was able to
  maintain enough health to get to the soulsphere. From
  there things went smoothly enough. I probably could have
  used some more practice with the ending.
