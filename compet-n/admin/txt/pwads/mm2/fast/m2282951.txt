| At first it looked like an impossible task. Surviving the start        |
| requires some unconventional routes. The way I do it in this demo is   |
| pretty reliable, 33% survival rate. Then in the tower I clear the      |
| first floor first (no pun intended, US = second floor). This is        |
| because if some cacos enter the lift, you're in SERIOUS trouble.       |
| Then I do everything in a very strange order, but keeping in mind my   |
| health. I need lots of health for: 1. invulnerability area, 2. blue    |
| key area with many cacos, 3. top floor with chainees, hell knights and |
| an arch-vile. I need at least 100/100% (green armor is enough) for:    |
| 4. chaingunner staircase. I lost much time at the end because          |
| something told me there were stragglers, but I was wrong. Now that you |
| get the idea how to do it, feel free to improve. 30 minutes does not   |
| look good...                                                           |
