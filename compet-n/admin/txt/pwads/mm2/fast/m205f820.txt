==============================================

A very clever demo by Archy. I extended his ideas a little,
but my route change doesn't seem to save time. It is just
less annoying - with one extra medikit and no need to wait
~15 seconds for that bridge rising.

In case I don't record anything more for this map - THIS was
the map after which I began to like MM2 so much. The YK area,
to be exact. I haven't seen such a surreal, atmospheric map
until... well, Arcadia Demade :)
