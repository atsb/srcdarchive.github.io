| Again, competing against myself from the past. Some parts have a nice  |
| flow, some parts are still cautious/slow/ugly/chaotic. I got 17:54,    |
| 16:54 and 15:07 (this demo). It's a very tough map and many things can |
| go wrong, so I'll leave another improvement for another player (I hope |
| this won't be myself from the future). At the tally screen I panicked  |
| upon seeing 99% kills, but yes! no monsters were resurrected, a very   |
| rare case.                                                             |
