| My previous demo in 25:50 was pretty bad, hence the idea of an         |
| improvement. Still, I spent much less time on this -fast than on the   |
| Max (10 times less?) and it shows. Forgetting about pressing switches  |
| can be embarrassing :)                                                 |
|                                                                        |
| Favourite moment: @3:23                                                |

| OK, my first -fast demo on MAP29 was faster than George Bell's Max,    |
| this one is faster than Andy Badorek's Max, so the next one should be  |
| faster than Chrozoron's Max :-P                                        |
|                                                                        |
