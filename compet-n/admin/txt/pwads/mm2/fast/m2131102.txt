Description:

This run was very tough. I was annoyed at the area after
yellow key's door. When I reached there first time, I usually
received terrible damage. Also, I was usually low health 
when I reached there second time for getting a soul sphere,
so I was often killed before getting it.
In this demo, my health was only 13% when I returned to the
start area. Because the lava causes the player 20% damage,
I was afraid of death. Fortunately, I didn't take any damage.
