==============================================

Just a few areas are significantly more difficult than plain UV Max.
- The switch which opens a door and reveals 4 hitscanners
- The room with HK, imps and barrels
- The mancubus courtyard
- The final area with cacodemons and 1 PE
Generally, demons, spectres, pain elementals and even cacodemons and
imps can cause trouble.

A rather lame demo (second exit actually) with one interesting twist:
unintentional blue key grab. This will come handy in Episode speedrun.
