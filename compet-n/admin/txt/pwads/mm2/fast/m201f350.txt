Description:

I was a little overcautious at places, mainly because there isn't really a
whole lot of health on this level that can be immediately accessed. I think
only 30% until you get to the Demon-secret room, then there's an additional
20%, then the Spectre room, where most of the health is.

The beginning went very well, every soldier toppled without too much health
loss...then some Shotgunners got lucky >.<

Visually pleasing demo, but I'm just a little bit overcautious ^_^'
