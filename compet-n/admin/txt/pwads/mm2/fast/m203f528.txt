  Description :-)
    
  I haven’t watched cyberdemon531’s demo so I don’t know where
  he played like a “basic bitch” and where he tried to go fast
  but died over and over again. The one place where I didn’t
  play safe is the switch with lots of pigs. I hit it and run
  out, then go back with SSG. It would probably be safer to run
  back and use chaingun or shotgun, but the fast way has a
  decent success rate. I’m not sure, but I think a good time
  for this would be around 5 minutes. This is my first exit.
