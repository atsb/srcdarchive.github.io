==============================================

About a year ago I submitted my first C-N demo and
changed my default difficulty setting from HMP to UV.
Playing on -fast is a new thing to me, so I chose
this easy map first and I wouldn't be surprised
if someone called this demo "lame".

Curious thing: a mancubus which is stuck on UV
fires his missiles perfectly with a -fast setting.
