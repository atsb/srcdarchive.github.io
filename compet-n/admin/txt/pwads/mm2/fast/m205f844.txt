  Description :)
  2 hours of work here, one of my favorite Maps of mm2 and I was 
  surprised that no one has done this beautiful map on -FASt yet...
  But anways, hard map do to the lighting but I need to mention 
  that this is a Complevel 2 ONLY demo so you PrBOOM(-plus) users 
  out there need the "-Complevel 2" command to play this properly.							  
  Oh and btw, this was my 3rd exit and HAPPY BIRTH DAY DOOM!!!								
								
  Note: Since this demo was recorded with MM2.WAD, I suggest you 
        drop by at http://doomedsda.us/lmps/675/mm2.zip
        and pick it up if you havn't already :)
