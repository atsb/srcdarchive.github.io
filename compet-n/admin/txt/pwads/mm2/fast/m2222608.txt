| In my TXT describing MM MAP28 first exit I mentioned this map played   |
| with -fast monsters. "Shitty weapons at the start" was a mistake,      |
| there's a plasma rifle of course. I thought this map would be hard. It |
| is, but only moderately - I don't fell like a hero after completing    |
| this one.                                                              |
|                                                                        |
| The start is very difficult,of course; with chaingunners, PE, you need |
| some luck. After that it's a matter of taking good care of Doomguy's   |
| health. Almost 1 minute was lost (about 7:20 - 8:10) because I made    |
| a long trip to get just one medikit! Luck was on my side in the BK     |
| area (loooow health) and near the YK I think, as the barons could have |
| been standing closer to each other and not let me in.                  |
|                                                                        |
| In case you're not familiar with this map at all. FAQ :)               |
| Q. What happened to the cyberdemon?                                    |
| A. It crossed an invisible line and teleported him/it self below four  |
|    crushers, which I activated by flipping a switch near the biggest   |
|    nukage pool.                                                        |
|                                                                        |
|(This was my question when I watched Henning's Max demo a few years ago)|
|                                                                        |
