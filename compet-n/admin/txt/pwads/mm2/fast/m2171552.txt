  Description : The time is nothing great but I'm happy I did it. It was a great challenge                  especialy in the begining where there is almost no health. It gets better                   later but health is still somewhat rare here. I thought for a while that I                  won't be able to do it. One weird thing was that when I went for the secret                 teleport I heard some noises as if an Imps fireball was hitting the wall so                 I went to look for him but there was no Imp. I thought it's only my                         imagination but when watching the demo I still hear them. Maybe you will                    hear them too I don't know.
