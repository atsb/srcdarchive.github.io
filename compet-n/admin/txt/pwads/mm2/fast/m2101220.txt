==============================================

The third time I survived the caco trap.
For the first time, I ran out of ammo (one baron left, c'mon,
kill him with fists on -fast?)
For the second time, I was way too excited and stopped thinking.
Jump to the pool full of spectres having 40 bullets.
For the third time... yeah, I almost killed myself at the end.
Just thought the rockets should be spent on hell knights "because
it's very safe and because there are 6 of them" ;-)
