I guess this is a pretty good run. Considering how the enemys attacked me, I guess I did good. However, I couldn't aim my rockets at the revenant well this time to get the backpack. I'm amazed how I managed to dodge that group of imps outside in the (supposed) yellow key area. Not really much to complain about here.
