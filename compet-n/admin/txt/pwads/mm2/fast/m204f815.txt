==============================================


Hmmm... I usually like my own demos (with all their flaws), but
I find this one a bit boring. Not sure why... all in all, it was
fun to record a -fast demo for this map.

For mappers looking for unusual ideas, check out the lift (sector
180 or tag 9). It took me ages to figure out what to needs to be done
to be able to lower it. Xit Vono lost quite a few seconds in his
UV Max demo because of this lift.

The backpack is still more convenient than the armor (cannot have
both). Maybe on NS100 it is the opposite?
