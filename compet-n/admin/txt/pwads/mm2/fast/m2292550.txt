==============================================

Insane on -fast, the only way I can complete this map (at all) is to play it safe and slow.
Did I say safe? You know, when mancubus fireballs and baron plasma pass through walls, you
can never be really sure of anything. I hope to beat UV Max one day, it would be more
interesting.
