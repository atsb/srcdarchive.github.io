| For me this map has two memorable moments. The first one is that long  |
| high ledge occupied by demons (seemingly harmless). The second one is  |
| the moment when 10 floating monsters are released, forcing the player  |
| to move forward, straight into chaingunners' fire.                     |
|                                                                        |
| I watched this demo and I have to say the first part is OK, but when I |
| reached that PEs+cacos trap in the later part, I began to play like a  |
| moron. I'd also like to explain why this demo features a seemingly     |
| experimental use of the only invulnerability sphere. At first I tried  |
| the "normal" usage, the one present in UV Max demos, where the invuln  |
| belongs to the blue key area and the megasphere to the BFG area.       |
| However, two times I was so badly beaten in the BFG area without being |
| invulnerable that I had to change the plan (I mean, after picking up   |
| the megasphere and clearing the BFG area I was left with 20%/20%       |
| health/armor, which was obviously insufficient to complete the map).   |
|                                                                        |
| The overall time is pretty good (for me), so I'm leaving this 1st exit |
| demo without further improvements.                                     |
|                                                                        |
