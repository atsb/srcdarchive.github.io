  Description :-)
    
  Eugene was right when he said “Xit beat my run easily.” I
  think this was the first time I did the first skip while
  recording and without missing the SSG. The run is OK except
  there is a little sloppiness at the end, where I could use
  more practice. I hadn’t yet found a reliable way to do the
  skip, so I don’t feel like dealing with that. I think the
  run is actually pretty decent, so there’s no point improving
  it unless I want to commit to getting a really good time.
