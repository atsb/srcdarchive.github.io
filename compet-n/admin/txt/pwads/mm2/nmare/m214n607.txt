  Description :-)
  
  This is one of those maps where I did a TAS demo a while back,
  but at the time I did not have a reliable way to do the yellow
  key glides. Since then, I have learned to do both glides reliably,
  so that makes this map considerably easier. I saw Looper's demo
  and thought it was a little slow, especially with the glide back.
  I wanted to beat his demo by skipping armor, but that wasn't working
  for me, so I went for the armor. Looper has quite a nice method of
  lining up the chainers, which made this quite managable. The red key
  isn't so hard with armor, as one can afford to get bitten a few
  times by the annoying pigs. From this demo, I can see that adding
  in the remaining secrets should be doable. The yellow key glides
  are easy enough that it makes sense to do them even if one visits
  that part of the map. The secrets that require special effort are
  the supercharge, the berserk, and the beginning one guarded by
  a seargent that contains 3 stimpacks and some ammo. Further
  research may be necessary to determine the best possible strategy
  for the secrets in the yellow key area of the map.
