  Description :-)
  
  The beginning is fairly luck based, but after that things settle
  down a little bit. I realized at some point that the best way to
  do the ending is to get the revenant to shoot the guy at the yellow
  key, and then go pacifist up to the plasma. Then it is important to
  preserve the invisibility up to the arachnotron. I had already done
  a few sessions of this, and after deciding on a method for the ending,
  I practiced for a while, and shortly afterward I was able to produce
  this demo. Actually in this demo the method with the revenant didn't
  work, so I had to risk getting shot by the chainer. Fortunately I
  didn't take much damage so I had enough to run to the end. There
  isn't much difference between a normal exit and secret exit run since
  the exits are so close together, and health is not a problem at that
  stage. I chose to do normal exit first, so I can consider a nightmare
  secrets run to the secret exit.
