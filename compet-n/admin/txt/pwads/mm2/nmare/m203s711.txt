  Description :-)
  
  Well this is definitely an action packed map in nightmare.
  I have enough practice in the beginning that I usually don't
  need to take any of the 3 medikits near the beginning, so I
  save them for later. Things start getting tough when you get
  to the pentagram area. In particular there can be troubles
  with the 6 respawning chainers in the cages. After getting up
  the lift, I chose to take a different route from what I did
  in my TAS demo. This time I go straight for the switch to the
  SSG and red key, and then run back to the lift so I can get
  the yellow key. This allows me to have more health for the
  final teleport, which is crucial. The one drawback to this 
  route is that when you go to the teleporter, there's a spot
  where a monster can get stuck and block the bridge from
  going up. This happened to me once, and if it does you
  don't have much chance of finishing the map. When I enter
  the teleport, I lose a lot of health right away, and I miss
  the exit switch, so I was lucky that the hell knight didn't
  kill me there.
