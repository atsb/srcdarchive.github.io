  Description :-)
  
  When I did a TAS demo some time ago I was not sure if this map
  would be possible without TAS. The problem was with the yellow
  key which released lots of monsters, and with the possibility
  that the red door would be blocked by cacos or other monsters.
  Well this map is indeed possible but it is one of the hardest
  maps I have ever completed in nightmare. Even though it is
  possible to have around 100/200 after the first teleport, there
  is very little health afterwards except for a soulsphere, which
  basically means you have to complete the rest of the map with
  200/200, which is a real challenge considering that the map
  is loaded with shotgunners and chaingunners, and there are
  some dangerous spots, such as the teleport back, and of course
  the yellow key. I've found that taking the key, then making
  a short detour to get the medikit and getting back to the door
  hopefully before it closes leads to the best success rate for
  that area. I've made it to the yellow key about 40 times, and
  in most of those I either get blocked at the red door or don't
  have enough health to finish the rest of the map with a
  reasonable probability. This is the first time I made it to the
  door after the yellow door, and while I had good health there,
  taking a baron hit made things much more difficult. I feel I was
  quite lucky to deal with the monsters at the end while only
  taking 3 points worth of damage(2 health and 1 armor). I was
  quite pleased that the other chainer was dead and the pain
  elemental was missing.
