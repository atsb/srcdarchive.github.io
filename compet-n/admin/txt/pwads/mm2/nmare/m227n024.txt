Description:

Well when I did 25 I didn't use sr50 cause I wanted
to challenge Sedlo's 24 and I thought from his demo
looks that he didn't use sr50, but when I checked
his demo's tics I found that he actually did use
sr50 so I decided to try it again with sr50

It was only a matter of getting switches fast and hoping
that stupid imp moves out of the way :)
