  Description :-)
 
  Thought I was done with this map... had uploaded :37 and then I realize I had forgotten a 
  shortcut, tried again and got this within a few minutes, lucky run.
  Uhm yeah... ugly as hell. Screwed up the blue switch horribly, had some mouse problems
  which made me lose a second or two there. Great fun action othervise! 
  0:29 would require a pretty good run from a good player.
