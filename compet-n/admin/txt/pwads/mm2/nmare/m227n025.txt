Description:

Where do I start ?! This run ends in tragedy :(((
Yesterday I looked for some short unoptimized runs to conquer and I saw
Sedlo's UV 24secs run in this map, I checked the NM record which was 29
by Casey, I said it should be easy to beat, my first exit was 28 secs
then in just 1 hour I got 25 secs then I said, I will go for 24 secs,
it should be impressive! I've got seven 25sec runs! This one was the
fastest. I was very lucky with the 2nd switch, I activated it very fast,
then I looked back to see if the imp moved away and he did, I said I
shouldn't waste this chance! I ran to exit and when I activated the
switch I expected 24 secs, but It was 25, I was very furious I exited
fast to check the exact time and it was just 2 tics away...
Still I think this one is harder than UV, cause of the luck needed to
survive arch-viles & archanatrons, and also I guess that imp on top
moves less often in Nightmare.
Anyway Enjoy!
