  Description :-)
  
  I have been at college and haven't had as much time for
  recording. I just graduated, so I won't have to go back
  for the spring semester. I decided to take a break from
  rn14 to give some other maps a try. I remembered this
  map and thought that it should be possible, and would
  be a lot of fun. When I tried it with savegames I discovered
  that it really isn't that hard. I was able to do this in
  3 fairly short sessions. As for the route, I used to
  backtrack to the yellow door after getting the red key,
  but now I take a more indirect route up the stairs so
  that I can have a little more health and a green armor.
  This way also avoids the risk of taking a revenant
  fireball on the way, although the other route is much
  faster.
