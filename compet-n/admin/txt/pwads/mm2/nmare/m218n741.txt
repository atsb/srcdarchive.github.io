  Description :-)
  
  This is definitely a frustrating map. It seems like it
  shouldn't be too hard, but for some reason it took a
  while for me to complete. I think perhaps 2 reasons
  for that are a lack of armor and many possibilities
  for monsters to respawn and cause trouble. I suppose
  it would have been nice to know about that medikit
  secret while I was recording, although in this demo I
  didn't need it. In fact I would suppose that to make
  it 100% secrets wouldn't require too much more effort,
  but that's for another day. Btw, I have a demo where I
  got to the yellow key with plenty of health, and while
  descending down the stairs towards the exit I encountered
  a pig and at that time my mouse spun out of control,
  causing the player to be chewed to death. I figured that
  if my mouse had worked properly there then I would have
  finished the map, as I expected to pass the end room on
  the first try. It turns out I was right, although things
  got a little dicey with my nerves and not having practiced
  it before.
