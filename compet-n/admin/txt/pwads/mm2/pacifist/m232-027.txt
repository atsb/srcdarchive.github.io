  Description:

  I was looking for some short speed run, this turned out
  to be a nice option. I didn't hope to beat Adam here, but
  after a few tries I got 0:28 and the run was far from a 
  clean one. I didn't avoid some mistakes in this one either,
  so a good speed runner can do 25s easily. 
  Btw. This is a pacifist too.
