Description:

Pacifist, Secret exit. Under 1:20 would probably be close to optimal.

The Yellow Key and the areas just before it are pure luck IMO. I had so many
times to die there that it wasn't even funny. Spent a good while on just
making it to the Yellow Key alive. You'll need all the health you can get for
that section...^^'
