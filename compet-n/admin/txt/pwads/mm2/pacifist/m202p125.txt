  Description :-)
  
  Sorry Dan, I'm not like Adam Williamson who likes to beat
  any newbie demo, but I watched this and thought it looked
  easy and that it was too slow.  Well, it isn't that easy but
  I don't think it's necessary to wait around that much for the
  imps.  Oh yeah, it's recorded with mouse too.
