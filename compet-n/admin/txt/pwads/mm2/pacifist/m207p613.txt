| Not too complicated, as the map is half empty if you don't shoot, plus |
| there is a partial invisibility, a soulsphere and four armors. I tried |
| skill 1 first, then skill 2 (a non-cheated 5:00 almost right away),    |
| skill 3 (cheated 5:59) and finally skill 4 (cheated 7:23) - all of the |
| above using PrBoom Plus. As for the final time - 6:13 - I believe it   |
| can be halved.                                                         |
|                                                                        |
| I don't think many more Pacifist are possible for MM2. MAP09 can be    |
| done with Vanilla if someone wants it, Kristian Ronge said MAP23 is    |
| possible (you need to know how to glide) and I would give some hope to |
| MAP17 (you need to know how to grab that blue key). Nothing more, but  |
| obviously if someone proves me wrong, I will not complain :)           |
