  Description :-)
    
  First exit. If I do this again, I may decide to take the
  soulsphere right away as it takes a few seconds to collect
  it on the way back. Also, you could improve the time by
  leaving an imp or 2 in the chamber with the hell knight.
  There isn’t anything extremely difficult in this run, but it
  seemed hard because there are lots of little things that can
  go wrong.
