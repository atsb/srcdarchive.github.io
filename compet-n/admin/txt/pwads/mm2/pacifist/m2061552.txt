  Description :-)
    
  I think this is not too difficult a map to do pacifist.
  There are plenty of large monsters to take care of any
  hitscanners, and more than enough health. It may be
  possible the fast way, but probably would require an
  extreme amount of luck, as UV speed is hard enough.
  This demo contains an unintentional telefrag.
