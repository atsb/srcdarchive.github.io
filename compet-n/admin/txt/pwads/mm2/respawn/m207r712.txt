  Memento Mori 2– Map 7 – UV Respawn

Bleh. I end up pausing for a bit at 3 minutes at that damn door to make sure the coast is clear for when I proceed in. With this being respawn, rooms are more crowded, especially here where demons try to block every move you make. Could definitely be improved to sub-7. Still faster than Xit Vono's nightmare run, though.
