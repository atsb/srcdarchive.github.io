| Table-filler. This map has no NM + 100% Secrets demo, and with "slow   |
| monsters" (respawn) was already quite challenging for me. First exit.  |
|                                                                        |
| Apart from the obvious red key grab trick, I used a blue key grab as   |
| well (I mean, even though the BK is easily accessible, you may pick it |
| up *without* releasing two extra revenants). Finally, for the first    |
| time in my life I had the final linedef skip with monsters. This       |
| surprised me a lot, hence my very strange movements in the last two    |
| seconds of the demo :)                                                 |
