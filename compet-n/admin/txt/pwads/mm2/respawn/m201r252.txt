Description:

Let me start this by saying that this demo is the work of about 2 months
of patience. I'd work on it during my free-time. Just didn't say anything
about it. It WAS still however, a rather difficult run.

Just like my -respawn run for level 1 of MM, there's a shortage of health
and you have a lot of monsters in a tight space. Add the -respawn factor,
and you get a tough run.

I missed a few shots, and I got a little worried at the end when all the
Imps were waiting for me, so I go to rush to the exit and a Shotgunner
grabs me and holds me for the Zombieman to shoot me or an Imp to fireball
me.

All in all, I guess this run was worth it...even if -respawn IS an
underappreciated category....
