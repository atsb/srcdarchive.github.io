| I got 5:18,5:47,5:21,5:11,5:21 again so this run received a warm       |
| welcome. Yellow key area looks nice, but at least two moments are very |
| ugly: getting stuck near a medikit (surrounded by those fast lifts),   |
| and getting stuck on a lift near the red key door (6% health, so how I |
| survived this, Mr.Sergeant?) Maybe there are faster routes, who knows. |
