Description:

So, this is the first undone MM2 -respawn, when browsing from MAP01.
I expected a big challenge, as there is no NM100 demo by Xit either.
One obstacle are 2 secrets containing 4 shells each - pretty useless,
and I have a tendency to spoil the jumps. The biggest issue is,
however, the red key door - a chokepoint, just like in UV Speed,
but more severe.

It is a tough run, but not as much as I expected.

At first it looked like a "slow, cautious UV Speed with some extra
secrets on the way" approach would do. But when I finally got to the
exit alive, the kills ratio was only 89%, so I had to "organize"
myself more kills.

This is the fifth time I reach the exit alive; too many kills
indicate Archy could get 6:30 with his 100% kills accuracy.
