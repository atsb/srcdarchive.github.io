  Description :)

  Arghh! this took much longer than it should, I found myself dying
  a lot more than the UV Max, also what pisses me off is I had 1:07 and
  1:09 with 98% kills much earlier (1 less monster) and the fact that in both
  these runs, I leave 1 out of the 3 imps infront of exit trying to save one
  mere second when I should have killed him !!!V_V!!!
  I just wanted to finish this run when I saw the gibbed zombie at start :)
