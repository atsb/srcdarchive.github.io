  Description :-)

  The eighth level of Memento Mori II, Stigmata, takes you on a ride through an
  underground slime processing facility.  What this has to do with the wounds
  Jesus Christ suffered when he was crucified is a mystery.  Also a mystery is
  how Denis Möller missed the painfully obvious HOM early on in the level.
  Anyway, this demo was recorded due to the suggestion of vdgg, who,
  unexpectedly, was inspired to appreciate UV -respawn demos because of my own.
  (Specifically M226R545.LMP and MM12R304.LMP.)  I'm still not satisfied with
  this demo, but I suspect any further attempts to improve it (it's my fourth
  exit) will end in failure, so I'm submitting this one.  Hope you like it
  anyway.
