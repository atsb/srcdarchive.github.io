  Description :)
  M205F844 was my second COMPET-N entry, as Rites of Passage is
  one of my favorite maps. A few days ago, I was playing this map
  on UV -FAST trying to beat Eugene Kapustin's time of 7:39 but
  after attempt after attempt, I gave up... for the moment that is.

  After seeing how easy it was for me to do M203R458, I decided it
  was time I do my favorite MM2 map on UV -RESPAWN. I first got a time
  of 4:47, I then looked up the record and saw it was 4:37 by Xit Vono.
  After watching M205R437, I was kinda surprised how poorly Xit Vono
  played, very unlike him, but it was then that I knew I could for-sure
  make an entry on this map. This LMP is my second exit, the first, as I
  said, was done in 4:47.

  Ahh, I wish more people played -RESPAWN, I didn't know how fun it was till
  I gave it a chance. Reminds me of Doom on the XBOX 360, which in order
  to get first place on the leaderboard, you must get
  100% kills/items/secrets on NM with a faster time than anybody else on
  the leaderboard. NM on the 360 didn't make all the monsters go fast so
  it was like playing UV -RESPAWN on the Disk Operating System. The
  XBOX 360 was what got me into Doom, I kinda lied when I said I've
  played Doom since 2002 here:
  http://www.doomworld.com/vb/showthread.php?s=&postid=832921#post832921

  I had a computer with Windows 95, and played some First Person Shooting
  games but not Doom. On the 360, me and my friend briangate1, where
  getting really good really fast. People literally thought we where
  cheating. Keep in mind that the XBOX doomers are much newer to Doom
  and don't understand things like SR40. To explain why I was so good,
  I always told them that I've been playing Doom for seven years,
  meaning I started in 2002. Then out of habit, said that to everyone. I
  don't know what made me thing of this (ohh ya, it's that UV -RESPAWN
  is like XBOX NM) but I just wanted to get that out of the way...
  What a weird text document.

  Random: When I got my Windows 95 machine back in 2002 (maybe
  even a little before that,) my two favorite games where Descent and
  Tyrian, both DOS games. I got soo good at Tyrian that if there was a
  COMPET-N equivalent for that game, I would have tons of entries.
