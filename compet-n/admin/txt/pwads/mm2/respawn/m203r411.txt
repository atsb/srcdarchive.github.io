  Description :-)
    
  Not bad, but could be faster. This is my second
  exit. My first was a 3:57 with 97% kills. I haven’t
  done enough research to know where I should be killing
  monsters and where I should just run past. Killing one
  pig with a SSG shot seems inefficient, but I wanted
  those stimpacks as I have lost many runs due to low
  health.
