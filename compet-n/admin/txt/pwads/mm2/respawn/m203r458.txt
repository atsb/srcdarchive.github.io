  Description :)
  My first -RESPAWN entry and this is my second exit for this map.
  The first exit I had a time of 5:12 but even though it beat Revved's
  time of 5:24 by 12 seconds, it was invalid because one of the secrets
  did not register for some reason.
  
  Easily beaten and easily beatable.
  								
  								
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 5:24 by Revved, timestamped:
  Monday, November 21, 2011, 8:40:42 PM.
