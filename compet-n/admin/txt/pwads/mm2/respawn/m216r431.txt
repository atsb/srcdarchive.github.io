===================================
Description:

It wasn't ridiculously hard, but the blue and yellow key areas aren't
a walk in the park and the recording process made me appreciate NM100
demo even more. This follows the NM100 path, I don't worry about kills %,
I *should* have over 100% anyway (in other words, I never exited with
less than 100%).

Third exit. Not shown in this demo, but I discovered that one may grab
two stimpacks through the wall (from the room near the blue key).
