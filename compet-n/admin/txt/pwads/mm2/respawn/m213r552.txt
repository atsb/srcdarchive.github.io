| A relatively easy map for -respawn. I believe -fast was more difficult |
| here - I didn't try it myself, that's just my opinion based on         |
| Tatsurd's run.                                                         |
|                                                                        |
| What can be done faster here is probably to release more monsters      |
| at the beginning (before going for the red key), as well as to         |
| to postpone the blue armor pickup - rather risky ideas if you ask me.  |
