  Memento Mori 2– Map 4 – UV Respawn

I was inspired by vdgg's NM100S run of this level to do this. Not really much different, but I was less cautious and more daredevilish as shown by the fact I have 4% health at one point. It's pretty much the  same route except I save a bit of time by skipping certain things like the armor pickup in the 2nd secret.
