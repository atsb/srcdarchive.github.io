Memento Mori 2 take III - complete lmp collection done in Compet-n style or
Scandinavian style or the UNREAL UV collection :)
---------------------------------------------------------------

Recorded by Chrozoron, Anders Johnsen, Peo Sjoblom and Henning Skogsto AKA "The Nordic Connection" :)

This is a collection of recorded demos (lmps) for all 34 levels of Memento Mori 2. All lmps were recorded on skill 4 (Ultra-Violence), ending with at least 100% kills and 100% secrets where it's possible, since the earlier collections are pretty boring to watch and one (Migru압) is also incomplete since it doesn앑t show all secrets (map06) or includes a LMP with less than 100% kills (map20 with 98% kills although 100% is possible). We decided to add some spice and go for a pretty daring and speedy playing (contrary to the earlier ones). Our goal was to be 2 hours faster than the latest collection by Migru which we did with quite a large margin actually reaching 3 hours even though he didn앖 do all maps (he wimped out on map19) so in fact it is even faster and we think he should have a "Time Sucks!" (plus 60 minutes) added to his total time for failing to do all maps..

To playback these demos, go to the suiting directory and type:

Comments about this wad


Chrozoron (Jonas Feragen) 
---------
Memento Mori II is a great sequel to one of the best megawads ever
released on the net. Some maps are pretty large and difficult;
(That's not necessarily negative, but it can be pretty frustrating at
times. Dying near the end sucks.) Jens Nilsen, you hear me??? ;)
Well, since I only recorded one demo (map29) for the collection, I won't
write much more ;) Of course Anders, Peo and Henning are the ones who
really deserve credit here! They're all really excellent players! 

By the way: Why do so many people say "mOmento mori" instead of "mEmento
Mori?" :)


Anders Johnsen
--------------
It has been a great Dooming experience to be on this team, and I'm very
happy with the lmps we have produced. They are all good recordings, even the 
not very inspiring maps have gotten hours of attention. MM2 is not a bad
MegaWad although the maps are generally too big IMO. For my part the 
inspiration needed to complete my levels, mainly came from the great team-
spirit rather than the maps. Many of the lmps in this collection have become 
personal favorites of mine. The ones I enjoy most watching, are Peo's map14
Henning's map07 and of course that incredible map29 demo by Chrozoron. A 
special thanx goes to Peo for assisting when there where problems in the maps 
which I couldn't solve. Not only is he one of the best players ever, but also a
GREAT teamworker. Besides, I want to thank Henning for doing map28, a map I was
glad to skip :) Another thanx goes to Jonas (AKA Chrozoron) for doing this 
wonderful map29 demo, despite his lack of time...


Peo Sjoblom
-----------
This will probably be my final doom project and what better way to end it than with 3 of the new players that have making their names heard in the last months. I am very proud to be a part of a team with these excellent players who I met through another awesome collection (Hell Revealed part II) where they made fantastic contributions..
I was also part of the first MM2 collection and I always felt my lmps there weren앖 very good, in this they are quite good and I also got a bit irritated by Migru압 txt in where he put down the first collection and delivered both a wimpy and incomplete collection himself and had the nerve to call it the "THE REAL SKILL 4 DEMO COLLECTION", here is another quote: "But then I saw this very bad, slow and boring collection MM2UVDMO " Those words can describe his own collection .
In general I am not too fond of MM2 (I base this on a single map point of view where the gameplay really sucks in some maps), I like Matthias Worch압 maps though but I have only played the maps I did for this collection and don앖 know how the gameplay is in the other maps. MM1 is much better IMHO, some of the music is great though .. If I should comment on the other team members lmps, they are all great but if forced to choose, I would recommend map26 by Anders, map28 by Henning and map29 by Chrozoron. Some people might think it is unfair to compare a collection made by four members to one by two, but I believe each of us could have gotten this time doing all maps alone, it would only have taken longer time to record.. I would also
like to state that I am no expert on wads, never built any maps and only like the challenge of
playing maps as fast as possible, I do appreciate original and nice looking ideas like for
instance HR map26 which is probably the most original and goodlooking map ever (probably
one of the hardest as well, yes it is harder than map 22 and 24, at least if you start it from 
scratch, then you앏l have only SSG for most of the map), so I mainly judge maps by their
playability from a Compet-n 100/100 point of view (that is: kill all opposition and find all
secrets as fast as possible)..


Henning Skogsto
---------------
This MM2-collection is one of the first Doom projects I've participated in. 
I want to thank the other team-members for all the great demos they have 
produced, and for letting my lmps being a part of this collection. 
Unfortunately I didn't have the time to record more than five lmps, but I 
hope there will be more than this the next time :) All in all MM2 is a great 
megawad IMO. Some maps are too big though, and that makes it even more 
difficult than it looks to produce a good lmp. I would like to thank Peo for
his almost perfect lmps, especially in maps like 19 and 11, they are both very 
big and he doesn't waste a single shell! Just that he volunteered to record map19
says a bit about this guy. I'm very fond of watching demos without a mistake, 
like map 19 among others....Think I'll pick this one as my favorite by Peo. 
Anders is just like Peo- they never miss :). Also Anders recorded many boring 
and big maps like 21 and 15, both maps are big, though 21 has a great 
architecture and is generally very nice, map21 is also one of my favorite demos 
together with the one of map 26. I could go on and on mention all my favorite 
demos by him, but check them out for yourself instead.  
Chrozoron didn't have the time to record more than one lmp, though it was more 
than perfect...I would like to thank him for this splendid contribution
as well.

Note) To find the supersecret maps, download the infopack and rename the
mm2info.dat to mm2info.wad, then use: doom2 -file mm2.wad mm2info.wad -warp 1 (or 2)
but both maps suck and it is not worth the downloading time..

Descriptions
------------

The descriptions were written by the team member who recorded the map.

MM2-01 - Outpost
----------------
A typical small map01 with little opposition, I was never good
at these kind maps.


MM2-02 - The Feeding Pit
------------------------
Very small, not much to say about it really. A bit annoying and 
not much fun...


MM2-03 - ...And Hell Beneath
----------------------------
IMO the first map with a nice architecture. I like this one. 
Not that easy in fact. 


MM2-04 - Ratamahatta
--------------------
I agree with what Andy Olivera said about it: "Looks like the whole
episode 2 from Doom 1 in one map" :) Awful!


MM2-05 - Rites of Passage
-------------------------
Medium good level, I like the beginning but further on it's too dark. 
There should really be an RL near the exit...My way of getting the
redkey here is not what the author planned :) 


MM2-06 - Trapped
--------------------
This map압 gameplay is just awful! (I hate to have to kill mancubi and
revenants with minor weapons far away)


MM2-07 - Frustration
--------------------
In this lmp you'll sure see that there are some frustration present :) 
Some sections in this level are great, apart from that I would like to kill 
someone for making that annoying door.
Still, I like this level a lot specially the part where you meet the first
mancubi. Also want to add that there's great gameplay here.

MM2-08 - Stigmata
-----------------
Quite a nice little map to play, the teleporting
in the end can be annoying though. I take a shortcut
to the green armor, the map builder put a hidden door
with stairs but I jumped to it to save time..


MM2-09 - Sabbath Sewer
----------------------
Hate it! The start the way I play it is extremely hard and
I survived that part about one out of five, played slowly it 
is easy except for that damn jump which is hard, not good looking 
either..


MM2-10 - Clear For Death
------------------------
Easy and small map. The architecture is pretty good, my taste
in particular when it comes to tech-levels. There should be 
an SSG here though (then again; no map should ever be w/o SSG :)


MM2-11 - Sewer Shutdown
-----------------------
A bit too dark and also easy to leave monsters behind,
I always got a bit confused in the teleporter area, quite
fun to do somehow.


MM2-12 - The Waterway
---------------------
Great design and gameplay, only a bit small.It
probably has the most health and armor of any map
I have ever played per virtual square meter.


MM2-13 - Devils Paradise
------------------------
Not one of my favorites, don앖 like to have to go
back to the start again for a secret, the lmp is
good though..


MM2-14 - A Question of Time
---------------------------
Great map! Very fun to speed through..
One of my best lmps.


MM2-15 - The Devils Coterie
---------------------------
Horrible map :( Sucking from beginning to end. I could 
have been more daring in the end of this lmp, but the 
map got more attention than it deserved anyway. Ok, maybe 
the caco-garden isn't all that bad. The start tends to be 
very hard if you're speeding, mainly cause of all the 
rapid-fire.... 


MM2-16 - The Nephilim
---------------------
One of MM2's better maps I suppose. Very simple and plain 
design, though its very clean. Lots of action here too. It 
seems somewhat frustrating if watching the lmp, but its pretty
easy to learn. Medium sized, and rather easy...


MM2-17 - No One
---------------
Really cool one! Action and speed all the time, just the way I 
want it :) Maybe the design could have been better (specially in
the early stage of the map). But that압 rather unimportant because 
of the quality gameplay.


MM2-18 - Regulate
-----------------
Rather big and boring map. Ok design, but totally lame secrets.
IMO this map demonstrates very well what압 ruining much of the fun 
in MM2...


MM2-19 - The Shaft
------------------
According to Migru (who chickened out from it) one of
the hardest maps, it is not easy but compared to HR only
medium.. I don앖 like the design and it is confusing but
this lmp is almost unbeatable and close to 30 minutes faster
than my first recording..


MM2-20 - The Experiment
-----------------------
Another ugly designed level- but with great playability. Lots of
fun all the time. My route here is a bit dangerous compared to 
Migrus old one. Can anyone tell me what the point of that
2nd cybie is??


TNT-21 - Sanctuary
------------------
IMO this is MM2's best looking map (at least in my share).
The difficulty is in fact pretty hard if speeding. It has some
hard points. Guess my demo could have been faster, but some rather
funny coincidence made me keep it. Watch those three barons fight each
other btw...


MM2-22 - R.R.F. Refinary
------------------------
The biggest map I recorded for this collection, typical MM2. Very big but 
still it's a nice built level with a varied architecture.  
It took me some time to learn this one.... 


MM2-23 - No Way Out
-------------------
Not the greatest of maps but quite fun to play
nevertheless, together with map14 one of my best
lmps from this collection (except maybe for the end).


MM2-24 - Io Lab
---------------
Great map, fun to play too, but I would have
preferred to have the big weapons a bit earlier,
nice to frag those small monsters in the end with 
the BFG though..


MM2-25 - Forgotten Town
-----------------------
Very, very complex map. Another "hard-when-speeding" kind
of level. Rather easy to get lost here, but if you know the
map its pretty enjoyable. Pretty crowded level with lots of
good qualities...


MM2-26 - Base Exposure
----------------------
Fun, simple and straight. I just love maps with lots of BFG and 
plenty of bad-asses to spend it on :) Many huge, open areas and 
some really bad silver-parts are other ingredients though....
The lostsoul cave can be dangerous, specially if you use RL :)
85% secrets is the maximum on this map!

MM2-27 - The Silos
------------------
Quite a good lmp of a boring map. That fat painee in 
that enormous lift almost drove me mad since they together 
with cacos are chickens on their own and she really tried
to hide from me..


MM2-28 - Corporate Hell
-----------------------
Another typical MM2 size. I kind of like this one, there are many different 
routes to the exit. Map-knowledge is very important here. 
I like the town-part in the beginning, maybe except from those lethal 
chaingunners who hang out there. Things can go wrong in the exit area too, 
and that압 a bit depressing since you've played quite a while before reaching 
it :) Really annoying those doors and lifts in the end btw.


MM2-29 - Kings of Metal
-----------------------
Ahh an excellent level. Jens Nilsen was a great WADauthor in his days.
Of course, MM2-29 is a large and very difficult level with unfindable
secrets, but the looks and feel is very nice. Personally I really like
wood/metal style levels. Recording the demo was quite a job though;
(hard level!) Also, my first demo got an out of sync error for unknown
reasons, so I had to do another. My time was improved, (but I was
lucky to finish the level since I played pretty reckless.) I didn't
really deserve to survive that Cybie fight near the end ;)


MM2-30 - It
-----------
Fun and fast to play, but really not very original. The keys
in the end are just annoying.


MM2-31 - Dejavu
---------------
I got a Doom1 flashback while playing this one :) Use your rockets carefully 
here btw, its easy to mess things up. I like Doom1 so I guess I like this 
map too....


MM2-32 - Dances With Demons
---------------------------
The most fun map of the ones I did. Definitely worth playing if
you need to hurt some sleeze-bags really quick :) No fuzz after
well hidden  keys or switches, just plain action...


MM2-S1 - Secret Operation 1
---------------------------
YUK! Need I say more? Oh well: Small, idiotic, mainly red/hellish team.
Almost all parts are damn ugly, maybe the first room is ok?


MM2-S2 - Secret Operation 2
---------------------------
The game-play is ok, but the design is very ugly. A lot better than
the Secret Operation 1 though. The two archies can be tricky, but 
its by no means a very hard map....Rather stupid placement of a
dozen cacos outside a sealed of garden, which can only be cleaned
through a window :(
