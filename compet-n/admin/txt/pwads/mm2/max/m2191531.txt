Description:

This was unexpectedly easy. The beginning was simple horrible. However I've gathered myself. I needed two evening starting from learning some elements of the level layout and monsters placement.

Believe you or not but this demo is my first exit under Peo's time with no live monsters. Three times I exited the level with an unteleported sergeant or baron.

I'm amused as it turned out.

Under 15 mins would be excellent time for this level.
