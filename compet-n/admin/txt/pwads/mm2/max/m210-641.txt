==============================================

First of all, big congrats to Anders Johnsen, who held the UV Max Record for more
than 11 years! When I tried to play like him, the best I could get was 7:20...
There are several improvements to be performed, namely:
- Close the 30-second bars as soon as possible. The Cacos should kill the monsters
on the other side of the room.
- Don't pick up the soulsphere, just trigger the secret (I was too afraid to do it).
- When fighting the Baron of Hell in a bright little room with stimpacks, shells and
  bullets: open the door after 7-9 shots. Two Pain Elementals will fly to the door,
  while the imps & spectres will stay where they stood (deaf monsters).
- Lure the last Baron to the crusher - a BIG time saver (I don't know how to do it
  reliably and it didn't work in this run).

I had a big advantage over Anders near the switch lowering the blue keycard (10-11 seconds),
but as usual, the last part sucked.

MAP10 stands out for me as the most modern-looking level of MM2.
