| Showing a possibility rather than recording a good Max - there's still |
| room for improvement. An ambitious approach would involve TWO barons   |
| killed indirectly - one by a telefrag, one by a crusher. Too difficult |
| for me... I suspect if this map had been taken by Peo instead of       |
| Anders, the time would have been 6:2x back then in 1998. I think so    |
| because Peo put much more effort into the demos, especially the short  |
| ones. I have beaten 3:23 on MAP12 only once, and didn't even get close |
| to 1:27 on MAP01.                                                      |
