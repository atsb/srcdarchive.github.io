==============================================

A note to level designers:
I alredy praised MAP25 (Forgotten Town), now after some serious
UV Maxing of MAP29 I like it even more! Please take a look
at those maps:
- no crates
- very few "teleporting monsters" traps
Everything lies in a splendid monster placement. The acid pool
area alone is sooo damn perfectly designed! I wish I could play
some new maps like these two.

In this demo there is sloppiness everywhere. The first cyberdemon
battle went perfectly, but the second one (the easier one) was
atrocious. I thought for some time I missed a spectre in the
acid pool area, this explains some shooting in the air and
looking at the sides of the pool. All in all, I'm honored to
hold a record for this map!
