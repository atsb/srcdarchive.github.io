| Thanks to Kyle McAwesome for his demo in which he shows how to grab    |
| the SSG quicker. I applied his strategy and saved bullets for the last |
| imps. Then it's just tossing the dice. Several times I got 3:06, two   |
| times 3:05, once 3:03 and once 2:58. There is a double telefrag (baron |
| + former human) and a caco telefrag in the later part. Luck, luck,     |
| luck.                                                                  |
