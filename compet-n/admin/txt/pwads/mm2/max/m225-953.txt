|                                                                        |
| For some reason, Ancalagon had mercy and didn't try (or record, or     |
| just upload) this one. This 9:53 is kind of bad compared to 9:58 on    |
| MAP21 or 9:57 on MAP28, but hey, it's me! I had several missed         |
| opportunities which would end in 9:4x or even 9:3x, let's say this map |
| is still too hard for me. In short:                                    |
| - I die anywhere before the RK door: sergeants, revenants, chainees... |
| - I kill every monster there but miss the jump to the edge leading to  |
|   the berserk                                                          |
| - My health drops to 0% before the backpack/armor secret. Especially   |
|   when I drop to the rocket launcher area                              |
| - Blue key area: revenants own me or I just forget to collect the key  |
| - Various death types afterwards (cacos/imps/arch-vile...)             |
| - Cyberdemon. I made a great progress and I win about 60% of the time. |
|   Still, dying after getting this far sucks...                         |
| - Arch-vile and baron combo. Sometimes. Not that this time I used two  |
|   BFG shots, effectively "wasting" one BFG shot.                       |
| - Missing the computer area jump or missing a monster somewhere        |
|                                                                        |
| So there, enjoy this first ever below 10:00 on this map, OK?           |
|                                                                        |
| Complete Historic COMPET-N Leaderboard (old records) - this is         |
| something SAV88 and Archy include in their text files which I think    |
| is a great idea. I didn't do this before since mainly I just fill the  |
| holes in the C-N tables.                                               |
|                                                                        |
| 26:21 by George Bell. Slow as the rest in the demo pack. Still well    |
|       done by George as he finished the hardest maps.                  |
| 19:25 by Migru. Less "what to do now?" moments. Saving cells for the   |
|       cyber and then wasting many, many BFG shots on it, which I found |
|       hilarious.                                                       |
| 12:02 by Anders Johnsen. First really speedy performance. First time   |
|       killing the cyber in the tiny YK room.                           |
| 10:47 by Anthony Soto. Improvements on weapon usage. Great demo.       |
|       Unfortunately, Anthony missed two monsters.                      |
| 10:38 by me. This was an astonishing achievement back then, one of my  |
|       first Compet-N entries. I improved the route which compensated   |
|       my skill inferior to Anthony's.                                  |
|                                                                        |
