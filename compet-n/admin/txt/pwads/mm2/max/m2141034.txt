==============================================

The more I play MAP14, the less I like it. During my first
experiences with MM2 (Hurt Me Plenty, usually not pistol start)
I would say this level is among MM2 top five. The atmosphere
was superb, the design, architecture, gameplay (now I'd say
"intended gameplay") were all fantastic. But now... it's
rather an average one. Why? It's soooo buggy. Most of the
errors work for the player's advantage, but I still don't like
the buggy side of this map.
- Slow monster teleporters
- Switches that can be pressed from "the other side"
- Shootable switches which can be shot at from the "wrong side"
  again

Well, so I cheated. Peo Sjoblom didn't know about those
switches. For me the important one was the switch near two
revenants and symmetrical stairs. Now I could kill 2 revs +
3 spectres at the very end with the super shotgun.

My favourite parts of this demo:
3:58 a demon is killed in the last possible moment before it
     is lifted up
6:52 5 SSG shots = 2 hell knights
9:22 3 SSG shots = 2 revenants

And the biggest mistake:
7:28 forgot to press the wall which lowers the soulsphere
