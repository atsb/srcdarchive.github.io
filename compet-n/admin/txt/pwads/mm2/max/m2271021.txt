| Eugene suggested something like (if I remember) that below 10:00 was   |
| possible, even easier than some others (MAP14, MAP25?). This was       |
| before SAV88 era... well I don't know, this demo shows a new approach  |
| to the 3 pain elemental area and features a horrible ending, but       |
| really, despite its ugliness, it has a good time for me - it looks too |
| difficult for me to improve it. I had three 10:4x, many, many 10:5x,   |
| that's it. Good luck to everyone else.                                 |
