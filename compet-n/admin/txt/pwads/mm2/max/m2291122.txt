  Description

Heh, a tiny improvement. It's too easy to miss one or a couple of cacos or spectres if you're speeding. Indeed I had two faster exits with a lost monster. The fastest one is 11:07.

This demo as well as all my demos from this year was recorded without sound. 
So I had to kill all cacos and spectres carefully. Besides I had hit some switches several times. 

May be I'll try to beat my present time. I guess demo's time could be under 10:30.

The route credits go to Jonas Feragen.
