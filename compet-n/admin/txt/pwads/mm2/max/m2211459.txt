  Description:  I had to re-do this demo because Anders forgot 20 cells. Pay no
		mind that it took almost 5 years for a proper follow up. =)

		Badorek's "Sanctuary" stands out as one of the better of MM2. I
		went back and watched Anders run. I think some of his plasma 
		usage was iffy...so I gave it a shot. First exit of course, so I'm
		sure 30-40 seconds could still be easily taken off. Hey, after 5
		years it's something...

		p.s. My first Anders-beater, woooooohooooooo ;-)
