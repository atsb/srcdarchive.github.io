Description:

I've skipped monsters in sector 83 and then come back with bfg. Sorry, I've not checked the map in an editor and missed the fifth secret sector location and lost several seconds. It's easy to beat this time. Beat it or beat other mm2_3 demopack maxes. Thanks Sean for the map. Peo and Miguel for the demos.
