  Description:  FE.

		An EASY 15:25 awaits anyone with descent skills and more
		patience then I. By some stroke of bad luck I can't seem
		to exit this map. When I do, of course, I get less then
		100% kills. Fustration set in and by now it's just anger.

		Hi Henna. I beat one of your lamer recordings. =))
