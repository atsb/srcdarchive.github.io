==============================================

This map is FANTASTIC!!! Play it now!!!
:)
The funny thing is, I wouldn't have tried this map without a
coincidence, because I thought it would be too difficult to me.
But: am I the only one to notice Antony Soto's 10:47 demo
(excellent in some parts) is invalid? He didn't kill a
chaingunner and finished with 250/252 kills, whereas 251/252 is
maximum. You know, I HAD to correct that thing...

Some new ideas here and there, compared to previous demos, route
changes as well. Many thanks to gggmork (who may not have played
this) for showing me several tight cyberdemon fights, with 2 BFG
shots needed to kill it as a goal. Thanks to Anders and Anthony
for their demos - I spent some time comparing them and trying to
find any weaknesses. Thanks to Migru for his demo accompanied by
a hilarious txt: "the cyborg room separates the men from the
boys". After reading this I expected some risky cyberdemon
treatment... Watch it by yourself :)

To finish, just to say I had enormous luck at the end. I somehow
couldn't (but wanted) to pick up green armor. Thanks to that
sloppy move, a revenant which I forgot to kill fired a missile.
This saved the run, otherwise I would exit with 250/252 :)
