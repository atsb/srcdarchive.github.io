  Description :-)
  
  Ahh an excellent level. Jens Nilsen was a great WADauthor in his days.
  Of course, MM2-29 is a large and very difficult level with unfindable
  secrets, but the looks and feel is very nice. Personally I really like
  wood/metal style levels. Recording the demo was quite a job though;
  (hard level!) Also, my first demo got an out of sync error for unknown
  reasons, so I had to do another. My time was improved, (but I was
  lucky to finish the level since I played pretty reckless.) I didn't
  really deserve to survive that Cybie fight near the end ;)
