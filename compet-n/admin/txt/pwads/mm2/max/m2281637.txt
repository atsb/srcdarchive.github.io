  Description :-)
  
  Another typical MM2 size. I kind of like this one, there are many different 
  routes to the exit. Map-knowledge is very important here. 
  I like the town-part in the beginning, maybe except from those lethal 
  chaingunners who hang out there. Things can go wrong in the exit area too, 
  and that´s a bit depressing since you've played quite a while before reaching 
  it :) Really annoying those doors and lifts in the end btw.
