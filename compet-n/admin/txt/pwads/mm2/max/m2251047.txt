  Description:  Claudio requested this one. I'm not sure why because my ISP likes
		to disconnect me at random intervals. I know he likes SSG action but
		this map has no more SSG usage then similiarly sized maps. Maybe it's
		one of his favorite maps from MM2. I think it's one of the better ones 
		at least. I expect Anders to easily take this under 10 minutes.
