  Description :-)
  
  Fun, simple and straight. I just love maps with lots of BFG and 
  plenty of bad-asses to spend it on :) Many huge, open areas and 
  some really bad silver-parts are other ingredients though....
  The lostsoul cave can be dangerous, specially if you use RL :)
  85% secrets is the maximum on this map!
