==============================================

I just can't believe this erroneous run is a new record.
All right, I had luck at the beginning with 1 caco telefrag + infighting.
Then I couldn't finish the last imp (near the RL), but what's happening
after the YK door is a real shame. Then, after teleporting I missed a jump
to the ledge and I said to myself "It'll be a good time, but not a record.
Not this time." Btw, my second best was 3:25.
