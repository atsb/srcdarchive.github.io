| I mostly agree with Peo Sjoblom and Andy Olivera (Visions of Doom      |
| site). It is not the most exciting MM2 level, but please watch that    |
| incredible NM run by Xit Vono if you haven't already. This Max is OK,  |
| but nothing spectacular, just some training before another episode     |
| UV Max Run attempt...                                                  |
|                                                                        |
| PS - A question to mappers: sector 13, the first door in the map       |
| puzzles me. It is "open, wait close (also monsters)" type. With        |
| -nomonsters mode, it behaves the way it should. With monsters present, |
| it stays open all the time... until you activate the yellow key trap.  |
| I sense the monsters trapped inside sector 152 somehow prevent the     |
| door from closing, and when released, the door closes. Is it correct?  |
| Aren't those monsters too far away from the door???                    |
|                                                                        |
