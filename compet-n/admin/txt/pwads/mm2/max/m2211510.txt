  Description :-)
  
  IMO this is MM2's best looking map (at least in my share).
  The difficulty is in fact pretty hard if speeding. It has some
  hard points. Guess my demo could have been faster, but some rather
  funny coincidence made me keep it. Watch those three barons fight each
  other btw...
