Description:

Recently,  Eugene and vdgg beat some UV-Max records from 
a very old demopack. It means that no one touched it over 
10 year. I also tried one of them. This map is really nice 
and a little hard. This map has several narrow passages,
so enemy's attacks can't be avoided easily there.
I got below 7 min which was my target after four demos
in 7:0x.
