|                                                                        |
| I watched m2141034 and I didn't like it - Peo's demo was better even   |
| if marginally slower. This time I concentrated myself on virtues of    |
| this map, trying to forget about bugs. It worked, this was more fun    |
| than frustration present.                                              |
|                                                                        |
| I'm glad I discovered a few time savers in this simple, SSG oriented   |
| level. Kimo Xvirus should be able to get 9:40, judging from his UAC    |
| Ultra MAP02 performance ;)                                             |
|                                                                        |
| Time "lost" in this demo: 1.beginning (BK can be picked up at least 7  |
| seconds earlier), 2.punching revenants (no luck with berserk damage),  |
| 3.chaingunner in the red brick area (I thought there was a chaingunner |
| / caco infight, I lost health and spent time on an additional medikit).|
| Time "gained": 1.pain elementals, 2.instant mancubus/baron infighting  |
| before the arch-vile section.                                          |
|                                                                        |
