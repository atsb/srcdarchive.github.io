| Yet another favourite of mine. The design is amazing in every inch of  |
| every room - just like in "Rats in the Walls" by the same mapper. The  |
| gameplay is violent, but quite fun IMO. My only, very minor, complaint,|
| is that one secret is difficult to register. My first fake exit under  |
| Eugene's time timed in 10:02 and had 88% secrets. Looks like I found   |
| a better strategy in a few spots, and, do I need to say, I am VERY     |
| satisfied with the time? The red key area and the mancubus/revenant    |
| infighting went much better than in my previous tries.                 |
|                                                                        |
