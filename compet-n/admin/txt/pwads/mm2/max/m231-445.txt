Description: Kind of had one of those revelatory coversations today with Anders
	     Johnsen in IRC. I had set a goal of getting a cyber nomination for
	     next years award. We talked about the feasibility of me getting 
	     a max cat nod and the more I realized it was not very feasible. 
	     After I completed m231-500 I singled out this map for a rigorous 
	     optimization. I could go to extensive lengths to shave mere seconds
	     off 1 map. As the discussion went on I realized that even if I could
	     make it "fast" enough would it be smooth enough? And if I could do
	     fast and smooth would the map be considered hard enough. Until 
	     someone like Johnsen, Henna, Vile, etc. puts their time stamp on this
	     map it won't get respect because I am basically competing against 
	     myself (no benchmark). That is ok to a certain point. I have no 
	     problem playing a map for fun. When there will be no distinction between
	     me exiting with a 5:00, 4:45, 4:43, 4:31, or whatever then I think it
	     is rather pointless, don't you? 

	     So, it'd be nice to create a demo which everyone enjoys. Maybe by accident
	     I'll create that demo by just having fun and steadily increasing my skill.
	     I'm not going to play every day for hours though. Thats just not me and it 
	     will never be.
