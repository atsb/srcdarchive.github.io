C-N entry #3.

Description: I followed advice posted by Looper and Creaphis for playing Doom in DOSbox, and it definitely helped quite a bit.  This was sort of a practice as I'm still not fully used to vanilla.  Something definitely feels different, but I think in time it will feel more natural.  Oh, I guess I should talk about the demo...I was looking for other maps by Sean Birkel, since I enjoyed Fava Beans a lot.  Sadly, this map was disappointing though.  While it's definitely a Birkel map, it also retains some of his trademark awkwardly-placed secrets which effectively ruined any hope I had of developing a decent route.  It also has the worst mancubus placement I have ever seen, just watch.  Bleh.
