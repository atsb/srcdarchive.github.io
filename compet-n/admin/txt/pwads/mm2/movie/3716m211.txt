==============================================

As you probably know, MM2 is my favourite megawad among the Compet-N PWADs.
Being a big fan of long demos, especially so-called "UV Speed movies" (demos
showing an entire episode or WAD), I was very disappointed to notice (3 years
ago) that nobody recorded such a demo for MM2. The reason, I believe, of lack
of "movies" was that many outstanding players simply disliked MM2 (why??).
Perhaps the only candidates to pull off an episode/WAD run would be Xit Vono or
Eugene Kapustin, but alas! either they did not make any attempts or they didn't
show what they did.

After 3 years have passed, I became much more confident of my playing skills,
so I could try at least an episode run by myself. Levels 21-30 are still too hard for me
(especially maps 25 and 28; I refuse to learn MAP28), so I had two episodes left
to choose from and I chose the second one (levels 11-20), for two principal reasons:

- I like these levels more. There is a streak of oustanding maps, from 14 to 19,
each having its unique qualities (from Ep1, I like MAP03 and MAP07 best).
- Episode 1 is more about "stupid" tricks which I dislike, such as death slides (MAP09)
or using strafe50 to avoid triggering certain linedefs (MAP04). These kind of tricks
(not to confuse with rocket jumps and arch-vile jumps which I adore) = skipping
the action. Besides, a death slide in an episode... We're supposed to kill monsters, not die!
This is at least what I think. Episode 2 is less buggy in this aspect, with the exception of
MAP14, plagued with bugs and stupid shortcuts (what a shame!) and a very small part of MAP11.

Don't expect 30pl4111 or 2611rq01 quality here. This demo may be comparable to 4104rq11 or
is even more lame. Initially I was aiming for a couple of exits before posting this, but the
amount of deaths convinced me to publish the first exit demo anyway. There will always be a chance
to improve in the future.

Route credits go to Gusta, Eugene Kapustin and Xit Vono for their outstanding UV speed runs
(levels 11-20). Even though I couldn't employ all of the tricks they discovered or performed,
watching their demos helped me tremendously. Additional credits to Dan Crowley, Anthony Soto
and Oyvind Stenhaug for their older demos and discoveries they made.

MAP11 Difficulty: hard, performance: :|

Without the soulsphere, which I always skip, certain luck is required. A rather ugly performance
here and an average time. Much time spent on that bloody switch.

MAP12 Easiest :)

No falling off the ledges, arch-vile blasts and such - a good run. The time could have been
better if the monsters hadn't blocked my way at the end. I had much armor left so I skipped
the blue armor here.

MAP13 Medium :(

There is a second, faster exit - see UV Speed demos by Oyvind or Xit. I triggered the door
closing the access to that exit, losing about 30 seconds and collecting the blue armor
as a consolation prize. I also didn't manage to pick up 4 rockets. On the bright side,
I survived; the time was bad but not horrible.

MAP14 Easy :)

Due to somewhat sloppy design, many parts of this level can be skipped. It's a shame, because
I like the atmosphere very much, somewhat similar to Obituary. OK, I press one switch from the
"wrong" side and shoot two lion switches standing on the top of the stairs - these are time,
health, ammo and nerve savers. As for two switches at the beginning, pressing them from the central
courtyard is damn hard. Besides, I need that blue armor for the next level, so I don't care about
"losing" 50 seconds or so (I can imagine myself pressing these switches during 3500 seconds). The run
went pretty well, only these demons at the end - ouch!

MAP15 Hard :|

Close to death twice... Not the best time, but I finished with 200/98 which is quite important.
I changed one thing in comparison to Eugene's UV Speed demo. In the yellow key area I do not
shoot, so the cacos do not teleport in near the staiway with rockets. With the blur sphere I am
pretty safe there even with the chaingunners around me.
About this level - I die here VERY FREQUENTLY, two nasty tricks as an example.
1) I kill the arch-vile, have 9% health, blue armor, rad suit and die because of "radiation suit leaking"
   (TWICE!)
2) I pick up the yellow key, plasma rifle, go to the switch, ride up the lift... stop. The lift doesn't
go upwards, a monster is blocking it. A death in the cage.

MAP16 Hard :(

OK, with rockets, plasma and 200/98 it should be easier than a plain UV Speed, shouldn't it? The problem is,
I have to exit with some health, too, as there is virtually no health in the first part of MAP17.
There is a soulsphere, but it is somewhat awkwardly placed (actually there are plenty of awkwardly placed
soulspheres in this Episode: MAP11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19). There was a moment of panic when I opened the blue
key door and got hit by a revenant rocket which SHOULDN'T be there... At the exit, as usual, I lost plenty
of health.

MAP17 Medium :|

Cautiously played - this is how I play it normally. Switching plasma to SSG versus an arachnotron was a
big mistake. There were problems with hitting that damn switch, too.

MAP18 Easy :)

I had 4:44 for the second time in a row. Very good, could be better, but one PE created an insane number
of lost souls...

MAP19 Hard :)

By recording my 8:37 UV Speed demo I wanted to check the possibility of finishing this level, which has a fame
of being extremely difficult. I think it is not, maps 15,25,28 and maybe some more are harder IMO.
I reached this level 5 times, died 3 times, succeeded twice. I think the teleporter sequence I chose is optimal
in the episode run, because of armor placement.

MAP20 Medium perhaps? :(

Only to finish... My overcautious play is shameful, I run to the medikit only to lose about 25% health in the
process... But it's over, no cyberdemon rocket-in-the-face this time :)
