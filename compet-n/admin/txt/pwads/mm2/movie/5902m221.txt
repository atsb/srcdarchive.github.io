==============================================

A rather early first exit (the first time I finished MAP26) and
not-very-stunning performance, but IT IS DONE!!!
I had enormous luck in MAP22 and even more in MAP28.

Credits:
I think I watched all the demos related to maps 21-30 from MM2.

MAP21 Difficulty: medium/hard, performance: :)

The episode starts slightly easier than m211, I enjoy it while I can :)
The good thing was, I didn't take any damage from the arch-viles.
I somehow spoiled the ending with the cacos, but still the time is
rather good.
A sidenote about the BK shortcut: in my opinion it is not intentional.
I think Andy Badorek assigned an Action to the linedef in the
testing phase and later forgot to delete it.

MAP22 Hard :(

I lost plenty of time due to a baron standing on the BK ledge. I was
also unlucky with the moving platform. This is the most difficult level
of the episode, I think.

MAP23 Medium :)

I remember watching Eugene Kapustin's speed demos with real amazement.
I expected it to be a very tough map, but surprise! it is very
straightforward and almost nothing can go wrong here. The only thing
I am unhappy with is the number of cells left at the exit...

MAP24 Easy :|

...because I like to clear the first room with the BFG. It's my best
time, but still it is very slow.

MAP25 Hard :|

Yeah, a rather cautious play here, but why bother with all the revenants
if one BFG shot kills nearly all of them? I like the cyber escape.

MAP26 Medium :(

My least favourite MM2 map. Can you see it by the way I play it? No
arch-vile jump, sorry, I have trouble with this one. A very bad
ammo management cost me a lot of time in the silver room (arachnotrons,
cacodemons and sergeants).

MAP27 Easy :(

STUPID STUPID SWITCH!!! I lost plenty of health, ammo and time here.
WATCH IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

MAP28 Hard :(

The first thing which makes me laugh at: the crates room. Oh my, it
is so funny I don't even feel ashamed of my performance here.
And the penultimate room. 2% health...

MAP29 Hard :|

A real struggle. I decided to play cautiously... only to get shot
by a sergeant right at the start. Then I chose the wrong teleporter
(not the one with green armor). I would give it a :(, but at least
the only successful arch-vile jump is present here.

MAP30 Easy :(

Yeah, slower than UV Max. 9 BFG shots needed to kill the cyberdemon.
Is this how I play normally?
