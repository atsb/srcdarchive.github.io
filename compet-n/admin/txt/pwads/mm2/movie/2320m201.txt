==============================================

I thought the difficulty would be more or less the same as for the second
episode, but this is easier. Fourth exit actually. A very bad run, but I find
my mistakes quite amusing.

Note: if I were responsible to set the rules for episode runs, I would not
allow deaths. I think I'm not alone with the feeling that dying (especially
in episodes) is "not quite right". For example, after a couple of suicide rocket
jumps in a czech speedrunning contest, the organizer, Mr.Twister, disallowed
exiting with 0% health. Here, in MM2, I think using a traditional route for
MAP09 gives a lot more fun (playing through MAP10 with the rocket launcher is
very cool). But this way is undoubtly slower. Thus, my attitude is not very
consistent - I kill myself (I kinda betrayed myself). If I ever finish the whole
UV run for MM2, it will be done without deaths.

MAP01 Difficulty: medium/hard, performance: :)

First off, about the difficulty. One can rush through this map Adam Williamson/Kimo Xvirus
style - in such case the difficulty is "impossible" (plus, just pressing the exit switch
is not enough - some health is needed for the sergeants in MAP02). One can kill most of the
hitscanners and three imps before the exit - then it is rather easy. I opt for a risky
route which nevertheless gives me more than 15 exits in 100 tries.

MAP02 Luck based :)

Harded than it looks (when speeding). This time I finished with unusually high health
percentage.

MAP03 Medium :)

The first amusing error is here in this map, at the beginning. I miss an imp 3 times
in a row from a close distance. The final time is rather good for me.

MAP04 Hard :|

Again, a good time, but I cannot rate it as :) because I play this map it as if I were drunk!

MAP05 Easiest :(

Some problems with the jump at the start...

MAP06 Hard :)

The beginning was very fast (and lucky: look at that first chaingunner which survived
an SSG shot). Overall, another good time despite some problems in the YK area and with
a few more chaingunners.

MAP07 Medium :(

DISASTER! I hope you'll find this portion of the demo amusing. I missed the red key...

MAP08 Medium :(

Very badly played, in the arachnotron area and later on.

MAP09 Easy :)

Easy run, but the time is very good (my personal record).

MAP10 Hard :|

One cacodemon did not teleport in. It happened quite often in my m210 max runs. In the
speed movie it was the first time - it is an advantage, of course. The things go really
bad after opening the yellow key door. I even thought the chaingunners would kill me.
