+=============+                                                          |
|                                                                        |
| Thanks to Revved for filling the tables in this category. However, I   |
| immediately thought 77:25 was a bit too slow and needed some           |
| improvement. Unfortunately, I didn't reach my goal which was below 66  |
| minutes. The engine just doesn't let me! In this run I finished MAP09  |
| after 62:16. I had two chances for a much better time:                 |
| 1) Finished MAP09 @ 60:41. On MAP10 only three cacos teleported in, so |
|    I knew I'd only have 99% kills. I continued, the final time was     |
|    65:37, but the run was invalid...                                   |
| 2) Finished MAP09 @ 60:25, but one demon hid itself in the waterfall   |
|    area. 99% kills. I "ragequitted".                                   |
|                                                                        |
| I die mostly on maps 1,5,9. Sometimes I quit after maps 1,2 if the     |
| time is not satisfactory. I had missed kills/secrets (!) on almost     |
| every map, but especially on 1,4,6. First exit was 67:42, this is the  |
| second one (a pathetic 12 second improvement). Even though I should    |
| know these maps very well, before this run I practiced some of the     |
| maps Max style and watched the Max demos of the remaining levels.      |
|                                                                        |
| I think the run does not require any comments until MAP08. I'd say     |
| it's for hardcore MM2 enthusiast (such as myself) or for hardcore UV   |
| Max run fans (I am not). Can be boring for the rest of the people.     |
|                                                                        |
| MAP08 - A slow monster teleporter, but there are many optional quests  |
|         which I leave until the end, so I actually never had 99% kills |
|         here.                                                          |
| MAP09 - I lost too much time here. First, three attempts for the first |
|         soulsphere in the church. Then I chickened out, didn't take    |
|         the second soulsphere right after getting the red key which    |
|         might have cost me half a minute. Very bad monster layout      |
|         after the invulnerability. At the end I check the waterfall    |
|         for stragglers.                                                |
| MAP10 - I should have used rocket launcher against cacos, this would   |
|         have brought down the sergeants at the same time.              |
|                                                                        |
| Some stats:                                                            |

| Finally, I compared this to a few 1st episode Max runs to check if my  |
| time is acceptable. UV Max C-N records from MAP01 to MAP10 have a      |
| total time of 58:43 (3523 seconds). This run lasted 4050 seconds.      |
| By dividing 4050/3523 I get 1,15 (the lower, the better the run).      |
| For Evilution, it's 40:16 total UV Max records, 47:46 for the run and  |
| the factor is 1,19, etc.                                               |
|                                                                        |

| So I'd say it's really not such a bad time after all.                  |
