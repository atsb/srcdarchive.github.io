| Lots of fun with this one! First, some checkpoints:                    |
|                                                                        |

|                                                                        |
| Yellow key         :50           :41              :43                  |
| Baron dead        3:06          2:36             2:29                  |
| Red key           4:26          3:38             3:33                  |
| "Mine" total time  :19           :24              :16                  |
| "Lift" TT         1:33          1:26             1:29                  |
| RL part TT         :45          1:06              :39 :)               |
| "Church" TT        :55           :44             1:02                  |
|                                                                        |
| As you can see, all 3 runs have some moments of glory and some screw-  |
| -ups. By listeting to the music I knew my YK pickup time was good.     |
| Then I wait quite a long time for the main lift, so I wanted a spec-   |
| tacular "stroller"-style entering the lift. Of course, I missed it :)) |
| Somehow I convinced myself to continue the run. The biggest time saver |
| is letting the 1st arch-vile alive and pray so he does not follow you. |
|                                                                        |
