  Description :-)

  Been busy with exams lately, but when I saw the new route
  (took a while before I realized what was going on, when I
  watched Casey's demo it looked to me as if there was some
  W1 linedef that lowered the blue key sector), I just had
  to give this one a try.

  My only change to the route is the path I choose from
  yellow key to yellow door. I think this one is a little
  bit faster. Oh, and I pick up another soul sphere on the
  way.
