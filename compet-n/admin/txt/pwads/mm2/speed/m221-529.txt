Description:

This level is one of those that's hard to speed, but yet somehow a fun one to
work on. This didn't take too long to get this time, and I'd say it's easily
improvable ^_^

It's still a shame that most of Memento Mori 2 is just...blah... >.<

Oh well, it could be worse. There are a few good maps on Memento Mori 2, but
they are few and far between.
