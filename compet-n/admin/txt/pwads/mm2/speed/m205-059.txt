  Description :-)
  
  Damn, this was a lot harder than I expected it to be.  The
  main difficulty here is getting the first jump on startup,
  which is damn hard.  The jump is not so hard if you back up
  a little and use strafe50, but this way you have to turn to
  get it.  Then there are lots of other things which can go
  wrong, like getting stuck by the imps, missing the switch
  trick, or getting stuck by the end cacodemon.  I found that
  a wake up shot makes it a bit more likely to get to the
  switch cleanly.  Pacifist as well.
