Description:

Haa! Ending with 1% health :P
The run is impressive, chaotic map for sure !
My first exit was 22 secs, and it was a low 22, so I thought about going
for 21, which took a while, and this one is a low 21 too :|
20 is possible, I remember playing even smoother and the monsters at the
yellow key room ran away from me :P but I died at the exit door, and that
happened many times so GL!
