  Description :-)
    
  I was really surprised to see this kind of time. I had
  managed a 2:42, a 2:58, and a 2:47 before I got this.
  I also had a bunch of tries where either the monsters
  blocked the jump or I simply missed it. The demo is fairly
  clean, and I didn’t spend that much time killing monsters
  that could block the jump. Getting up to the lift a
  second time was quite intense.
