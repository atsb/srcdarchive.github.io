Description:

Yay, under 3 minutes! =)

I was gonna improve my old 5:29 speedrun of this map at some point down
the distant future, but since Eugene decided to improve, I think I'll
just go ahead and take it back now ;)

And no...I don't think this one is hard to speed anymore ^_^

All those Cacos at the exit....it's like Attack of the Killer Tomatos! XD
And with only 11% going in there.... ^_^

Blue Key route credits go to Eugene Kapustin, the remaining route credits
go to myself ;)
