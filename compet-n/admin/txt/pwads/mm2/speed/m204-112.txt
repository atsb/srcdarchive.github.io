C-N entry #63.

This demo is sort of a double-header, introducing two tricks for this map:

#1. A linedef at the start causes 3 of the 4 passageways to seal up when crossed,
    and a switch in the remaining passageway will open them again.  However, you
    can strafe across the line without triggering it, allowing access to the 
    other passages early.  This normally isn't too tough, since the linedef is
    right at the start, but in this particular route I have to cross the linedef
    TWICE without activating it.  More of a luck factor than anything else. :)

#2. This one is much easier.  You just jump to the second end pillar as it rises,
    thereby not needing the first pillar at all.  This, combined with the third
    pillar, allows you to reach the exit.  It cuts out a large portion of the
    level.

A time closer to 1 minute is possible, which is really cool since the map is
pretty ugly, and being able to bypass the greater portion of an ugly map is always
welcome, IMO. :)
