  Description :-)
  
  Just wanted to show an interesting thing I noticed in 
  this level: you don't need the yellow key! The switch 
  marked with yellow actually needs the blue key to be 
  activated (as does the one marked with blue).
  Wonder if this was done intentionally or if it was just
  a mistake by the editor...
