Description:

A demo with the exit trick. After some practicing in nomo I got the skipping from the first try with the time 4:27. I've activated the trigger three times in a row before I've got this one. 
I've never seriously tried a route without ssg and soulsphere. I guess that such route is faster but needs a lot more tries to open the yellow door. So this demo could be beaten easy.
