  Description :-)
  
  After hundreds of tries, most of which ended in a too slow keygrab,
  I was quite surprised that this one clocked in at :58.

  I'm reasonably satisfied with this demo, though, I managed to do some
  wallrunning by the imps, and the switch trick near the exit is reasonably
  fast.

  This is also a Pacifist entry.
