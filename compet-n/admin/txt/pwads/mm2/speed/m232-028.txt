  Description :-)
  
  Well, this demo has a pretty funny background story,
  which you probably won't find half as funny as I did,
  but I don't care and I'll tell anyway (heh).
  
  This all happened a few days ago as I downloaded the
  latest batch from /incoming. I checked out the text files
  as I usually do, then left watching them for later. Then
  some days later I was checking them out again, and saw
  Opulent has a m232r116, and I thought "Woah, Anders did
  a Max in some 2 minutes, big improvement let's see how
  it's done", so I watched his run and decided that this
  level could be pretty good for speedrunning. So I loaded
  up the editor with MM2.WAD and checked out MAP32, wandered
  out for a few minutes in the editor trying to figure out
  the way to the exit (it's pretty damn confusing when you
  watch a maxkill demo and don't know which switch does what).
  So I sat down playing and quickly realized the cyber scene
  is pretty much the key scene, and somewhat later I got my
  first exit of 0:45. I thought, well that's not bad compared
  to Opulent's 1:16 -respawn, and it's a first exit anyway
  why not uploaded it. So I went back to my directory of the
  new demos (D:\incoming\tmp29\ - for no logical reason),
  and wanted to borrow one of Opulent's text files (usually do
  that to spare some writing). So I was kind of shocked when
  I realized Opulent already recorded this map in a speedrun,
  and his time of 0:35 pretty much makes my time look like
  a newbie finish. So I thought, "He damn better use a different
  route or I'm gonna eat my hat", so I went to check out his
  demo, and if you'd been sitting besides me then, you would've
  heard me go "Aaaaaah! Aha! Hmmmmmm...", etc.
  
  So I quickly decided I should give it another go :)
  
  So here it is, I didn't improve much on the route except that
  you don't need the rocket launcher, I wanted to have a megasphere,
  but the mancubus also wanted it and I didn't want to argue with him,
  also not shooting is a pretty good idea because it doesn't wake
  up the teleporting monsters, in fact I ended up so well in not
  shooting anyone that it became a pacifist run, that's pretty nice.
  It's a pretty low 0:28 and some bad moments here and there so
  feel free to improve.
