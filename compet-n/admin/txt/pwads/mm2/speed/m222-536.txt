| Sorry, not this time. I even had 5:04 with a few saves, no         |
| spectacular play, as well as a *real* 5:44 in which I reached the  |
| blue door 10 seconds earlier (can be much earlier still).          |
|                                                                    |
| My main new invention here is what I do with the pigs and archvile |
| area, this was after a meticulous study in DB2, I was examining    |
| all the "Block Sound" linedefs. My previous strategy (1+3 BFG      |
| shots instead of 2+2) can be seen in the aforementioned 5:44 demo. |
