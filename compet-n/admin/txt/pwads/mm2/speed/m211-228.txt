  Description:

  My 21th Compet-N Entry...  

  I invented the switch trick some time ago but was too lazy to make
  some demo for it. Casey's demo forced me to move my ass (thanks:)
  and this is a result. Still can't survive it w/o supercharge... 
  Btw. This is an old lmp and txt file which was somehow missed
  in last two updates.
