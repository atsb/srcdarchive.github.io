| Both m207-315 and m207-259 have their flaws, still both are fantastic  |
| demos IMO (Eugene skips both blue armors and a pair of revenants, Xit  |
| Vono presses a switch "through" a hell knight). My run was based       |
| mainly on m207-259. I don't know if Xit Vono will bother with such an  |
| inferior category as UV Speed (it's only skill 4 after all), but I'd   |
| love to see some non-Nightmare! demos from him sometimes ;)            |
