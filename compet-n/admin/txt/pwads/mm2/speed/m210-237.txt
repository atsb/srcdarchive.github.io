  Description :-)
  
  This map is very crowded for speedrunning.  I use 2 tricks
  here, the bars trick and the yellow keygrab.  There's also
  a trick possible with the blue key but it is definitely not
  practical with monsters.  You can jump from the stairs to 
  the slime platform and grab the blue key there.
