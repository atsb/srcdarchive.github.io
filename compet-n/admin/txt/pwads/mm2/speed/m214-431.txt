  Description :
  
  The blue key switch grabs are not that hard if you know the right angle. Just face
about 40 to 50 degrees towards the switch. Have it just barely in view and make sure
you can see at least part of the switch face. Sometimes using the midbars3 texture as
a frame of reference can throw you off - because the left side does not match the 
right side. 

  The GR switch grabs are somewhat random. Switch to SSG and make sure there are no
enemies in view or it will autotarget. Then you shoot and hope one of the bullets 
strays north. After opening the doors you've got to be careful not to let the demons
block the teleporter jump. In this demo I had to draw them away.
