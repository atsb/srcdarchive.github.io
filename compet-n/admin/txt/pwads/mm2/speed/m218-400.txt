==============================================

The idea was very simple - leave alone the SSG + soulsphere combo...
It has been my most frustrating Doom experience ever. I include two
failed runs which show why I'll never play this map "UV Speed" again
and why I don't care whether the time is below 4:00 or not.

m218fai1 would be 3:58, m218fai2 would be 3:51. After the second
defeat I was roaring like a wounded lion.
