  Description :-)
    
  I lost time in 3 different places. First, I needed 2 shots
  on the first chainer. Then I missed a shot to open the way
  to a switch. Also, I got stuck on a pig for a little bit
  which means the door was partly closed when I got there.
  Considering this, I’m a bit surprised this is a record.
