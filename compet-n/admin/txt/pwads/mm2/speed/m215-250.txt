| Almost identical to m215s251, maybe slightly better. One green armor   |
| less collected. In theory, it is the secret exit demo which should be  |
| one second faster, so this one is effectively two seconds better than  |
| the previous one. It may sound too corteous, but Eugene's initial      |
| demos were very good as table-fillers - much better than his *first*   |
| m216 and m222 entries.                                                 |
