  Description :-)

  18th COMPET-N entry.

  This demo shows a remarkable trick, so I'll explain the 
  story behind it.

  Earlier tonight, Eugene Kapustin mentioned, in a thread 
  on Doomworld, that a glide was possible in MM2 map 23. 
  It seems author Eric Sargent forgot to tag linedefs 
  1729 and 1730 as "impassable", meaning a glide could be 
  made through the 32-unit gap between sector 9 and 269. 

  This was confirmed by Graham "Grazza" Burgess, who 
  managed it in a -nomonsters run.

  So I started to play this map with the purpose of trying 
  the trick out in a speedrun. For a long time, there was 
  no success. But then, suddenly, I made it! I was so 
  surprised that I quickly got ripped to pieces on that 
  attempt, but soon I was working myself down from a lousy 
  first exit of 0:40, to 0:10, 0:08, 0:07, 0:06, and then 
  this. It's possible to do it even quicker; I'd say 0:03 
  would most likely be the optimum time. 

  The glide itself isn't really that hard once you get 
  the hang of it -- it's much easier than the similar 
  glides in e.g. Doom 2 map 16, and Kama Sutra map 32. 
  
  I found it's easiest if you don't straferun at all, but 
  rather try to go through "straight".

  Pacifist should be a nice challenge (although I'm quite 
  certain it's feasible): there are monsters shooting at 
  you from all sides, and the imps at the end close in on 
  you very quickly... NM should be most interesting.

  Credits for this should of course go to Eugene Kapustin 
  and Graham "Grazza" Burgess. By the way, Eugene, I really 
  hope you'll try to get 0:04 or even 0:03 here. You 
  certainly deserve the point for this map after all your 
  fine m223 runs.

  On a final note, I'd like to quote Adam Hegyi, from the 
  textfile of lv24-036:
  "PS. Will we ever end finding new tricks?"

  The answer to that question is, of course: "No!". :-)
