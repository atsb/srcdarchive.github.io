  Description :-)
    
  I wasn’t satisfied with my 2:50 at first, so I decided to
  try some more. Then I got 2:30, which wasn’t bad, but I
  thought I could improve it by having the imp hold the door
  open for me. Then I had a 2:29, but I got stuck a lot and
  didn’t want to go to all that trouble for just one second,
  so this is my next improvement. It could still be faster
  of course, but I think I’m done for now.
