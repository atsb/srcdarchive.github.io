==============================================

Although I consider Eugene much better / much more experienced player than myself,
I didn't like too much his m216-239 demo. What caught my attention at first were
2 barons of hell (about 20 seconds spent on killing them). I think however that the
biggest flaw of the Eugene's demo was the way he dealt with the teleporter room -
another 20 seconds just to clear that area... which wasn't necessary.

My demo is less crazy and slower than Eugene's but some minor route and tactic improvements
allowed me to beat his time by a considerable margin.
- grab the red key and skip the barons
- skip plasma rifle
- after getting the BK don't enter dark rooms with hitscanners, just return to the RK door
- *CRUCIAL* - DON'T KILL ANYONE IN THE TELEPORTER ROOM, JUST GO TO THE TELEPORTER WHILE THE
  STAIRCASE IS BEING RAISED

OTOH, i "wasted" time on:
- stimpacks
- blue armor,
which actually saved my life at the end.
Enjoy the run!
