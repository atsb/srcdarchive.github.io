Description:

Well, I needed to do something, haven't done a demo in a while, so I thought I'd
try my luck with speedrunning again.

While downloading the Max-Kill demos for Memento Mori 2, I'm starting to wonder
if MM2 is as bad as I had originally said...anyway, I watched the Max for this
and noticed it was one that could be fun to speedrun. ^_^

My favorite part in this whole level is the last big room with all the poison.
It's a nice room, and nicely layed out. I got kinda confused at the teleporter
part even though I was sure I knew the route, but I just sorta forgot it at the
time I went to go through them.

Ammo...there's barely enough it seems on this map. Health is also a slight issue
until you get to the end where you've got a Megasphere you can grab, but in this
run by the time you get it, it's kinda...useless ^^'

I grabbed a Rocket Launcher I didn't need, and I miss a few shots and lose some
time, but all in all, this is a decent demo ^_^
