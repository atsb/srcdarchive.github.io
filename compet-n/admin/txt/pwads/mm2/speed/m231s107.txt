Description:

This is for the Secret Exit. I'm making that clear because I'm not really certain
about how this is supposed to be named, so I'm taking Vono's advice on naming it.

Under a minute would be a definate optimal, but 1:07 is pretty impressive...I had
a few 1:12s and 1:16s that looked better than this, but still I'm happy ^_^

The Yellow Key is mostly luck for me, as you have to get in and out before
everything starts to teleport in. I want to thank Johnathan "Incubus" Scott for
inspiring me to do this run with his normal exit speedrun.

I think Nightmare and Pacifist would be possible, just a LOT of luck would be
required for both of them ^_^
