Description:

My favorite map from Memento Mori 2. By far.

I had been wanting to speedrun this one for a long, long time, and I was looking
for any shortcuts possible. Because the map is rather large and complex, I didn't
want to speedrun it without some sort of trick.

I started out actually with trying the trick used in pl21 at the bar guarding the
exit, but that just wasn't big enough to blast through it.

That's when I started looking through the map with WadAuthor to try to find what
switch opened that bar up. The switch was in a good spot, so then I went in with
-nomonsters to see if I could flip it from below, which I did. So when I was able
to flip that one, I decided to add the monsters, and well....this is the result ^_^

And so I finally have a record for my favorite Memento Mori 2 map ^^

This demo is also Pacifist.
