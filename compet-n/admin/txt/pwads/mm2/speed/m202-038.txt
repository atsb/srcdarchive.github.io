  Description :-)

Not my favourite kind of run at *all*, but this isn't a bad time. This map
would be an ideal speedrun, except for one tiny little thing - the yellow
key lift is rather random, like the lift in MAP13, sometimes it comes up
straight away, sometimes you lose 3-4 secs waiting for it. A complete fucking
pain, and the reason why I can't beat this time even though it could clearly
*be* improved. I did an initial nomo in 35, so I guess at least that is poss.
