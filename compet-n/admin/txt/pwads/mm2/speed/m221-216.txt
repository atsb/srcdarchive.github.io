  Description

Two years ago I recorded a 2:37 run after Casey beat my first exit demo with the shortcut. I was going to upload my new demo to incoming and found there a new record with time 2:27. Next several evenings I was trying to beat Oyvind's time. Got two 2:27 demos but no faster ones. Now I tried this a run style level for a change after map 22 and in twenty minutes got this lucky demo. My first exit was 2:30. This is second one.
