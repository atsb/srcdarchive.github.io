==============================================

Most hated monster? 1.Chaingunner 2.Revenant 3.Spectre.
In this level, however, the spectres win, i.e. i hate them more than anything else.
The one near the berserk, the teleporting one, two spectres guarding the Plasma Rifle,
one blocking my way after picking up the Rocket Launcher... so malicious.

This is a table-filling demo, so don't expect anything spectacular. For me, it's
fast enough. Thanks to the last arch-vile for not resurrecting the revenant.

...and this is a gorgeous level in every aspect.
