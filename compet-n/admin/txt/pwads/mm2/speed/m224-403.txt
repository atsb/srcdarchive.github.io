  Description:   

  This is my first contribution to COMPET-N.

  I was going for the max category, but it started to become a
  bit frustrating for a newbie like me, so I left it aside and
  took up speed, which doesn't have any submissions. Plus it
  helped since the start is pretty much the same for both
  categories, because you have to clear the beginning, which
  is monster packed. I'm no expert but this run seems to require
  some luck; if monsters aren't cooperative (particularly the
  Barons from the central room and the Pain Elementals outside)
  it's no good. Now I think I'll go back to trying max again.

  By the way, this map seems to be based on Birkel's map in
  01SHIT.ZIP, that he states is something that was left in his
  harddrive after he lost mapping inspiration, so I was wondering
  if he joined the MM2 team to finish it. The map has a start
  area that's much like FAVA's E1M7.
