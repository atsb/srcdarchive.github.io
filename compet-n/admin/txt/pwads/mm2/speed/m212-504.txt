  Description :
  
  You want to know why MM2 sucks for speeding? This fucking map. As well as 30
others. I'm so pissed right now I could scream. Time sucks, I improved only 
once but I can't handle any more mental anguish. New tricks, but who cares
to describe them. I'm so tired of ripping half my head of hair out for this
map.

Why do I even bother trying to find reedeming gameplay value in this suck-ass
wad? I would normally NEVER upload anything this crappy. Just realize how fed 
up I am; but I'm doing this for instructional purposes to reveal these tricks.

No fucking speed demo is 5 minutes long; piece of shit mm2. GRR
