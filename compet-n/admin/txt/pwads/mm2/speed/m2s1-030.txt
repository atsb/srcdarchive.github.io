  Description:

  Talk about a blast from the past!  My previous 0:34 demo was my first Compet-n
  demo, recorded back in 2007 when I was still starting out in Doom
  speedrunning.  In retrospect, anyone could've beaten it if they were skilled
  enough; all it would've taken was for them to care enough to do so -- a
  difficult feat, considering what level it was recorded on.  But it just so
  happened that my demo was beaten by the legendary Adam Williamson!
  
  Having markedly improved since then, I decided to try to secure my spot in
  this level and discipline, whether or not it's actually a level you can
  compete on.  And so, I toiled overnight for about four hours, trying my
  hardest to optimize this demo.  The result is a demo which beats Adam's record
  by one second; the /exact/ time is 0:30.06, which is just about optimal.  This
  is partly because of improved movement and shooting skills, and partly thanks
  to a trick I discovered in the red key room that would be more fitting in a
  wire-fu martial arts movie.  I could go further, and try to get this under
  0:30, but for now, I'm releasing it; I'm way overdue to go to bed, and my
  wrists are killing me.  Enjoy!

  Prior to recording Doom demos, I did some usermap speedruns for Duke Nukem 3D.
  Video versions of these runs and my most recent Doom demos can be seen on my
  YouTube channel at http://youtube.com/user/TheGreenHerring, and I hope to have
  a website again in the near future.

  P.S. This level still sucks. ;)
