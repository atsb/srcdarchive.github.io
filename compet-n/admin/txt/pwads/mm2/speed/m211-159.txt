| If you're lucky (not too many demons blocking your path) and healthy,  |
| you may try it without the megasphere, just grab the blue armor, pray  |
| for even more luck and get a time around 1:45... Well, that's what I   |
| guess would be a good time here for a modern speedrunner-perfectionist.|
| I don't use SR50 in this map, the hallways are too curvy for me.       |
