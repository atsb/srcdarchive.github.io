C-N entry #53, movie run #21.

21: A somewhat long opening map for an episode.  I collect cells here for map22.
22: Ah, this map is most memorable because of the two dueling spiderdemons partway
    through.  If you're wondering why I sneak past the imp in the cramped hallway,
    shooting him would awaken a horde of chaingunners/imps to make my life hell.
23: This map is actually not too difficult to speed, but there is a bit of concern
    regarding the room with the line of archviles on both sides.  If they start
    firing before you can get out, start praying that they let up before the
    invincibility wears off. :)
24: A very easy map to speed run, which is a nice change of pace after the previous
    three levels.
25: The comments for map24 also apply here.  This would also be a nice fillup map if
    something somehow went wrong in map24.
26: At the yellow key area, I take my time to remove the imps that are released after
    dealing with the knights.  If they are standing in the wrong place, they can
    prevent the bridge back out of the room from rising and you would be stuck there
    permanently.. yeah, it sucked when it happened to me. :)
27: This map can be a pain if map26 left you with low health/armor, but reach the
    megasphere and things should be fine from there.  Thanks go to the Momento Mori
    god The_Fish for his route help on this one, it really came in handy. :)
28: Alright folks, bear with me on this one.. this map is the final challenge of
    Momento Mori and the longest map from the whole wad.. as well as the map I spend
    the most time on in ANY movie.  Luckily, I have a few tricks up my sleeves, such
    as the red key grab.  Otherwise, gradually weakening the free monsters, hitting
    the proper switches, and getting the hell out of there is the way to go.
29: A nice reward for the shit you take in map28, just run to the exit!
30: I have always regarded this map as one of my favorite map30's from any megawad.
    The map is wonderfully designed and Milo's take on the boss situation is pretty
    cool.  I use the BFG strategy on the cyberdemon, then switch to rockets when I
    run low on cells.  It took a bit longer to remove the cyberdemon than I had hoped
    but it was still faster than previous attempts.  My nerves really suck, so I get
    shaky while taking shots at the boss. :)

From the 3 Momento Mori episodes, this one is probably the most stressful due to its
length and a variety of challenging levels.  As you can see, it's likely that a 30mm
would be about 80 minutes long, but cut me some slack when I start work on it.  An
80 minute movie is the longest I've ever taken on.. hell, I thought 55 minutes for a
30ev was stretching it a bit.  I'm going to need a break before trying it (plus I
promised Dash I would try a movie for Death Tormention II for Mirra) but wish me luck
in the meantime. :)

Oh man, a 30mm is going to destroy my nerves.  I can hardly wait.. :)

Previous times for this run were 35:31, 34:04, 32:52, and 32:24. (I played this one
a lot!)
