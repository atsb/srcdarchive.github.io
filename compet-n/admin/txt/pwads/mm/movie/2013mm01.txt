C-N entry #49, movie run #19.

01: A cool start map; I exit more healthy than usual.
02: This map originally struck me as impressive, with MM's new textures kicking
    into high gear.  Quite fun to play through.
03: Another short map, sometimes those demons early on can slow you down.
04: The first MM map that's nearly impossible to speed, so I slow down a bit.
    The yellow key area can be dangerous to run through.
05: A nicely designed map!  The area behind the red bars can be tricky.
06: Another fun map to play, nothing can go wrong here.
07: This map is the hardest one to speed, especially in the maze area.  I almost
    die there in this run, so that should provide a little excitement.. it did for
    me, phew! :)
08: That jump at the start seems deceptively difficult for me.. I can never get it
    by the second try, even. :/
09: This map is pretty intense, definitely among my favorites from MM.
10: A short and easy end map.. strangely designed too.

This megawad is among my favorites and doing a 30mm would be a real pleasure,
which starts with the first 10 levels.  These levels remind me of pl11/ev01,
where the levels are combat intensive and tough to speed. I really enjoyed
making this run and I hope you enjoy watching it. :)

Note: I recorded this with mm.wad, but not mmmus.wad
I don't think it should make a difference if you play it back with the MM music.
The music in MM also kicks ass, IMO. :)

My previous times for this episode included a 23:00, 21:34 and 20:34.
