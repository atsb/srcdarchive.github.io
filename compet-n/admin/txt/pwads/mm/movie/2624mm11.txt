C-N entry #49, movie run #20.

11: A short run, nothing to worry about for a start level.
12: Me and Dash discussed this a bit and concluded that this level is indeed
    worse than ev22.  Why?  Because ev22 lets you exit in under 20 seconds,
    unlike this terrible level. :)
13: An interesting design on this one, which is cool; definitely more complicated
    than the original Inmost Dens.  I get the plasma rifle here.
14: This is my favorite level from this episode.  Wonderfully designed, with
    only the end part to worry about.  A note about this map: picking up the
    chaingun at the start actually triggers something useful later in the level.
    A strange stroke of design that's only noticable in movie runs so far, since
    you would usually skip it then.
15: A similar thing occurs at the start of this map, with a small sector around
    the SSG.  The only problem is that the switch this sector opens up needs to
    be thrown to complete the level.  I found this out the hard way in a previous
    attempt. :/
16: An easy map with lots of powerups and cells for the taking.  It even gives up
    a free megasphere at the very end!
17: I like the design of this map, plus I get another free megasphere towards the
    end. :)
18: This one might be the toughest to run, as some parts can be pretty dangerous.
    Check out Oyvind Stenhaug's 4:10 run of this map, it's pretty impressive to
    watch and helped this run quite a bit. :)
19: An easy and kinda ugly map, just get to the end as fast as possible.
20: The megasphere/invincibility combo really helps on this map. :)

As you can see from the time, the 30mm will most likely be longer than a 30ev, up
to the +1 hour range.  These levels demonstrate that Momento Mori was not built
to be speeded, so expect the 30mm (if it ever happens) to be a more casual run. :)

Previous times for this run included 28:37, 27:31, and 27:11.
