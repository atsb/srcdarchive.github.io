  Well, I have found that with carefully lined up wallrunning
  (and luck), it's possible to get up the stairs without triggering
  that lowering ceiling. It's far into the level though, so having
  to retry if you don't get it right in a Max demo will be a lot of
  work.

  I also found some kind of switch-from-below trick that saves 4 of
  the button presses in the area after the one-way teleport from
  behind the red-key doors.
