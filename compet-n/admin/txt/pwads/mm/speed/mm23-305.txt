Description:

Another one of Memento Mori's best.

A sweet one to do with speed, and there's all sorts of plasma you can burn through
with the BFG once you pick it up ^_^

Under 3 would be possible.

Also kinda strange I had the same exiting time for both, mm23 and mm26....I just
find that kinda weird ^^
