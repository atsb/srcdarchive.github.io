  Description :-]

  This route is inspired by TAS movie by Nikolay "Heretic" Kamnev 
  (still in progress).
  Firstly, I record a demo with doom2+ (it's default "port" for me lately) 
  two months before and got 2:47. 
  Today I have re-recorded and improved it with original doom2.exe.

  The main problem within this route - monsters. ;] 
  They teleport from player path to random places at any time, especially barons 
  to narrow path in hall with toxins. My previous attempts are 2:37, 2:36, 2:35, 
  and now I get 2:17 with much better luck (no one damned barons in front of
  gate!)

  My 1st compet-n entry - hope no last. :]
