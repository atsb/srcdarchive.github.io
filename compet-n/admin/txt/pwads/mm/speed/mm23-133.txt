  Description :-)

  Ahh Nostoglia! Memento Mori is the first PWAD I ever played. I first played it
  3 years ago, I wasn't as good as now :P, I remember having real trouble with this
  map, I beat it with lots of saves, then I downloaded the UV-Max run for this and
  I was shocked, it's the 2nd or 3rd demo I've ever seen IIRC
  This map still holds a special place in my heart, I love it and the suicide exit
  makes it awesome, I wanted to do it hehe
  Very Weird story with this run, my first exit was 1:37, then my 2nd one was 1:36,
  then I got 1:35 then 1:34 :o after that I said, yeah! next one would be 1:33
  But it wasn't I got 1:35 next, then 1:34 then finally 1:33!
  I'm including Oyvind's run because my run isn't really a lot better than his,
  both runs have different strong points, watch them and compare !
