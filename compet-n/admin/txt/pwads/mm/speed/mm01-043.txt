Description:

I don't think Doug quite understands how this level works when he says his
0:44 is 3-5 seconds from optimal. 0:43 is very, very close to optimal, in
actual fact - i'm not sure if anyone will make 0:42, and i'm 99% sure no-one
will get 0:41. Reason is simple - it's all to do with the 30 second trigger.
The 30 second bars close just before you hit the first switch, so it doesn't
matter how long you take killing imps and sergeants at all, as long as you
get out with the bars still closed. The whole thing is nicely set up so you
can kill imps and sarges and preserve your health, and still get out in time
to have four shots for clearing up outside sarges and troopers. Then you have
3 or 4 to kill the chaingunners before the bars open. Then you have to be
*perfect* hitting the switch and running for the exit. The only two parts of
the run that matter for your overall time are from start to first switch and
from third switch to exit, and they have to be perfect. Only way you could
get a decent improvement here is to figure out a better way of doing the exit
(don't think there is one), or manage to not trigger the 30 second linedef,
twice...
