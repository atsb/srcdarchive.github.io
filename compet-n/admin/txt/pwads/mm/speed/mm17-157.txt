  Description :-)

  11th COMPET-N entry.

  I made this run in between my max run attempts on this map. 
  It's actually quite fun for speeding, contrary to popular 
  belief (except for the start, maybe). I remember Erwin Lin 
  complaining about the lack of health and armour in his 4:28 
  speedrun of this map, but he missed a very obvious help: the 
  megasphere! ;-)

  The jump I found to the megasphere is probably a new "trick", 
  I haven't seen it used elsewhere. With this jump, you lose 
  very little time and the rest of the run becomes a breeze, as 
  long as you watch your step at some parts.

  I played carefully in the red key area, but I'd had some bad 
  past experiences trying to pass the Barons (and Arch-Vile) 
  without killing them... Another discovery I made was that the 
  Mancubus trap isn't nearly as dangerous as one might think. 
  You're quite safe up there -- just waste the Mancubus closest 
  to the switch, push it, and get out of there. :-)

  The run isn't that quick, the main purpose here was simply to 
  demonstrate a viable route. Therefore, there are still some 
  obvious improvements; for example, you can save a couple of 
  seconds by not going for the SSG (I just used it a bit in the 
  yellow key area), and by succesfully hitting that switch from 
  below...
