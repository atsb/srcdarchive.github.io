Demo entry #1.

Description:

Henrik Rathje is one of my favorite designers. He only did MAP18, but I just
love the second-hardest MM level. It's long, colorful, dynamical, and as Andy
Olivera wrote, the progression is top-notch. IMO, Mark Klem's great music track
"Hidden Anger" from MAP01 really fits the feel of MAP18, and does not fit
MAP29.

Explosively fun map for speedrunning. Stx-Vile said: "check out Oyvind
Stenhaug's 4:10 run of this map, it's pretty impressive to watch". Well, in
2004, when I discovered Compet-N, the first demo I downloaded was MM18-410. At
that time Oyvind's run impressed me a lot and I thought I can never beat that
guy, but soon I tried it myself, which resulted in 4:06, then 4:00. In fact, his
run wasn't all that fast (unlike his excellent demos for some of the easier
maps, MM15-255 and MM16-158).

In late 2005 i switched to a better control, and was pleased to get such an
improvement over my old record. Still, it's the oldest of all demos I uploaded,
and now I don't like it too much. Relatively smooth, but somewhat lame in style,
and with some unnecessary monster-killings in the later half. It's doable well
under 2:30.
