  Description :-)

  I must admit that I haven't watched the 6:35 record demo, but
  I discovered a little rocket jump here. Unfortunately, it seems
  to be useless, since one could really use the health for the end,
  and there are mancubi blocking the way, so you don't really save
  much time at all. So I've done the speed run in the regular way,
  but the trick is included in a bonus nomo demo, "mm09rock.lmp" :)
