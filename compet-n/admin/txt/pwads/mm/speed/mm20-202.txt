Description:

Nice level to speedrun in my opinion.

I had a few problems running this, as near the end my keyboard does
something funny and I try running into a wall ^^'

This could go below 2 minutes definately, even faster if it's possible
to leave the Megasphere/Invulnerability combo out of it...but that
would make it a much harder run ^_^
