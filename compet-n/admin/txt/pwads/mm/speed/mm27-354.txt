  Description :-)

  This is just first exit, after I gave up trying to complete
  the level without armor/megasphere.

  I just wanted to show a couple of small tricks:
  - A jump to the blue key area; this is possible either by
    jumping off the nearby stairs or by using an archie-jump.
  - The wall closing as you move into the blue key area can be
    blocked, either by the player or by a monster. This avoids
    a 30-second waiting time.
