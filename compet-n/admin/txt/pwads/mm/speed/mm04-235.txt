Description:

I do NOT know where this came from. I was consecutively getting 2:54...EVERY exit
was 2:54 up until this one, which came from nowhere. Dunno WHERE I saved time
though....maybe at the Yellow Key and the Hell Knight hallway maybe? ^^'

Once again, no SSG grab here either. Got it once but died later...with the SSG
grab, this one could definately go below 2:20, maybe even faster. It's just that
the trick is so hard to do and so random it seems...

Now that I think about it though, the monster movement and infighting probably
attributed to the faster time. Everything just seemed to cooperate ^_^ Yet I lose
time at the switch to the Red Key...I didn't hear it activate so I go to check
back and lose some time there.

Not really sure how much faster I personally could push this one....oh well, I'm
happy! ^-^ And yeah...the Hell Knights are a real pain in this map, especially
early into the map, but like I said, you just gotta get lucky here for a great
time ^_^
