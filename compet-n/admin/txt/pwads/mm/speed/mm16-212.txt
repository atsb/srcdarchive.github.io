  Description:

  My 5th Compet-N Entry...  

  Thanks to Spinspider for teleport-bug trick. It probably depends only 
  on player's luck. In this demo I have one bad attempt. I still haven't 
  managed to do the level without mistake :-((( so this is my best
  time. I changed the route, instead of taking plasma and megasphere
  I must survive the way to the supercharge in lava. Sometimes it's
  frustrating, ecspecially the elemental and lost souls blocking the lift
  are very annoying.
