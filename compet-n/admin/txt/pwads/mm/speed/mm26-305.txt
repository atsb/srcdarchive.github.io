Description:

Weird...I grab the Berserk and my keyboard just starts goin' all freaky on me.

Anyway, below 3 is definately possible. This just isn't the type of map you try
to speed up, but it's fun doing so ^^

Didn't die too much on this run, just had minor setbacks in which I kept
screwing around or messing up.

The place where I get the Red Key, all those little ledges to jump, I never made
it on the first try, so I lose a little bit of time going through there.

One of the best maps out of Memento Mori ^_^
