Description:

Under 3 minutes like I was aiming for. ^^

Under 2:30 is possible, if you have everything go perfectly...it could go even
faster than that I'm sure.

I included a nice trick demo (mm04grab) using an SSG grab. I was doing it on
accident on rare occasion. You have to walk along the edge and bump it just
right. I was hoping that I could pull the grab off on a successful run, but
that never happened as when I did it the Hell Knights would be blocking my
access to the Blue Key and I'd die, or something else would happen and I'd
screw up. Anyway, combining the SSG grab and a perfect run, as I said, it could
go under 2:30, probably faster than that.

Not much else to say really, other than I was working on this one for a few days
to get a time that I liked. I also still like this map quite a bit. It's my
favorite map of the three by Jens Neilsen ^_^

Oh yeah...one more thing. Those Yellow Key Barons can be fatal ;)
