  Description :-)

  The blue key grab has got to be the easiest ever,
  although it doesn't save a lot of time.
  However, I also found a hidden switch that I had
  never noticed before. With that, the baron room past
  the super shotgun can be omitted.
  Also, I use a little switch trick to get access to
  the SSG faster (switch in spectre cage).
