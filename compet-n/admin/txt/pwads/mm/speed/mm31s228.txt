  Description :-)

  5th COMPET-N entry.

  The first of MM's two secret levels can be described as 
  so: Technically brilliant, extremely complex, and dull.   

  Maybe some people fancy the perplexing layout but I don't 
  care for it much. This map starts out tough and never quite 
  eases up. You're bombarded with (mostly) hitscan monsters 
  without any armour at all. Health is scattered around here 
  and there, but if you let up even one second in the run, 
  you're dead! It's very hard to get the right speed and avoid 
  max style playing.

  I played the start rather safely, and then progressively 
  tried to be more reckless. Worked out so-so... I was aiming 
  for a time below 3:00, and believe it or not, this was the 
  first exit below that time. I kept missing the trick jump, 
  so I could practice the first parts a lot. I only worked on 
  the run about 45 mins total, so don't expect a very polished 
  performance.

  There are some horrible moments here -- my playing at those 
  imps is embarrasing, for instance -- but I was also very 
  lucky to get through some spots quickly. I almost got killed 
  at the very end because the door wouldn't open! A time below 
  2:00 would be sweet to see, but will require very gutsy 
  playing.

  Credits to Istvan Pataki for the trick jump, and Casey Alvis 
  for some route ideas/tactics, the run-to-catch-the-teleporter 
  trick (at least, I think he made the first demo to exhibit it, 
  if I'm wrong please let me know!) and of course for being the 
  first to pull off this annoying run.
