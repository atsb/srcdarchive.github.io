Description:

"When you speed, you bleed"...quote the Fish from his 9:58 Max-Kill for
this map :)

It suits the level, for any type of run...but that's my opinion ^_^

Didn't play this exit too much, got it only after about 20 minutes of
trying...I forgot the Super Shotgun at one point so I had to go back to
grab it.

The demons at the end...jeez....that's a lot of them ^^' And I lost some
time waiting for the bars to raise at the exit -_-'

Pretty much the same thing as my secret exit speedrun, just the ending
is different ^_^
