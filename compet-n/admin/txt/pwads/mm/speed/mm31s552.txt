Description:

This was a request demo from a LONG time ago...so here ya go Fish, enjoy this one!

Yeah...it's long, but the map has no armor on this route >.< And it's full of the
Zombie-type enemies, so you have to be careful.

The exact time on this demo was 5:52.02...but it's my first exit, and I'm just
happy that I FINALLY got an exit on this painful map...it's just...evil. One of
those maps that's just aggravating to speed...and I kinda forgot the route at the
end of the demo -_-' Oh well...

Anyway Fish...I got it done for you finally, so enjoy! ^_^

This is for the secret exit.
