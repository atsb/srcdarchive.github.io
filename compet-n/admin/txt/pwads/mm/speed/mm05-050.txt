  Description :-)

  Just wanted to show a little switch-from-above trick
  that makes the super shotgun room a little faster.
  With this route, you never actually wait for the bars in
  front of the hell knight cage to lower, but use a
  teleporter instead.
  Also, some time is saved by staying on the ledge, grabbing
  the red key without having to wait for it to be lowered all
  the way down.
