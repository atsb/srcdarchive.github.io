Description:

The most hideous, annoying, ugly, and unplayable map in this entire Megawad!!!

This can go faster I'm sure, but the map is so ugly that it's not worth the time.

I've been trying to get help on finishing up the UV-Speedrun tables for Memento
Mori and Hell Revealed, any help would be greatly appreciated you guys! I'd love
to see them all completed!! Thanks! ^_^
