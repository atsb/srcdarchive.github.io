  Description :-)

  A great ending map, original boss situation. Using the BFG strategy is not
  easy, you have to have a very good aim. And beating Andy Badorek's 1:36 lmp
  was not too easy, didn't take many tries though. I also didn't avoid the
  cyberdemon's rockets to have exactly this kind of exciting finish - I love
  them! :-)
