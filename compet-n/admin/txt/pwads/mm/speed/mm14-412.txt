Map description
-------------------
A good level for speedrunning, imho.

Description: This is my first demo for compet-n. It sucks, but hey, now I'm on the map. =)
	     The place I messed up the most was fighting the cloud of chaingunners which
	     comes out from that little nook by the mancubus. I started off by trying to
	     snipe at them, but it appears a SSG rush works better.
