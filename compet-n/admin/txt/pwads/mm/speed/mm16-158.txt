  Description :-)
  
  "Gusta"'s old demo was pretty good, so I had to work for
  a while to get a decent improvement. I basically use his
  route, though some time is saved by rushing in the
  shotgun guy room to start the building stairs before
  killing them off.

  Some luck is required (or as in my case, dozens of retries)
  to get past the pain elemental without being blocked and
  at the same time get the run-over-teleport-linedef-without-
  triggering-it trick on first attempt.
