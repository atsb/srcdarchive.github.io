  Description :-)
  
  At first I found the hell knights very annoying, but now that
  I have some experience they don't seem too bad anymore.  I
  remember this being quite a smooth run but if you can do the
  ssg grab then you can certainly beat it.  It should be possible
  to beat normally but I don't know how much luck that would take.
