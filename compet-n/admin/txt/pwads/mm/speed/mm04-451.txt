Description:

This map isn't really that bad to speedrun. You just have to do a lot
of killing. Well...not really as much as you would think.

The only real problem areas are the SSG (trying to get it), and the end Baron. Those I guess I kinda took my time on, as I didn't want to screw up and die or something. ^^'

It's a nice level, one of Memento Mori's better ones ^_^

I guess route credits go to Drew "stx-Vile" DeVore, I used his movie
path to go through this level.
