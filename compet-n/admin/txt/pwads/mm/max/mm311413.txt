  Description :-)

  This is a coop optimized level, you may ask how could I get 100% kills?
  The answer is a tricky jump, with that you can get in the coop area and kill
  the monsters out there. The jump could be done easily from the teleport, just 
  turn to right a little bit and simply walk (not run!) and you will land in 
  the second player's area. But you need some luck to finish with 100% kills
  because there are some monsters who sometimes doesn't teleport in. I got some 
  tries with 99% kills and almost 2 mins faster than this lmp ;-((  
  I hate these monster teleport tricks.
