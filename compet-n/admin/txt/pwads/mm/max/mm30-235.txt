  Description

Today I decided to pay some MM. I tried nmare run on map01 and then I entered map30. I've tried nmare run 15-20 times. Then I decided to try max. I was shot in time two years ago and gave up in our competition with Casey. Today my literally first try was ended when I missed rising platform at 2:29. See mm30fst.lmp. I had 2:28 with a lost caco after almost twenty minutes. (I've included mm30-228 with a lost caco into the archive.) I had 2:36 and 2:37 iwth one live caco from level's line up and 2:33 with two lost cacos. First legitimate exit takes almost an hour and half. The demo time should be under 2:25 so if no one beat my time I may return to this map sometimes.
