  Description: Peo's route was excellent, I hardly had to change a thing.
               This demo makes a big improvement over the last time
               (3:35), but Peo's demo looks better. Mine has lots of little
               mistakes here and there, particularly at the start.
               But I was lucky with monster fights and various other things,
               so it probably evens out.

               I'm a bit undecided about this map. It's got some great
               fights, and some of the design in the first few areas is
               great. On the other hand, the second half of the map is
               completely map, as if two separate maps had been glued
               together. Maybe the map should be split up... but then again,
               playing it I found it it really wasn't as big as I'd thought.

               Mind you, if this map showed up in MM2 it'd be twice as
               large and maybe half as fun :)
