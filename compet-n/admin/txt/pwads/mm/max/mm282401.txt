  Description :-)

  This was the biggest map, I have ever played. It is quite confusing at first 
  sight, a lot of switches with no visible actions. It is even more confusing 
  after you played it one hour and didn't finished yet... the second problem is 
  the secrets... I visited every secret sector and not 100% secrets  maybe my 
  mistake, maybe a bug, anyway you will see every secret sector.
   I had some mistakes, especially with archvilles, but it's quite enjoyable, some
  braveheart fighting with less than 20% or 10% health...  I got lost only for 
  some seconds, and a nice cybie killing scene, unfortunately there is a
  surviver, a silly shotgunner, at the exit corner. Kill him when you walk there!
