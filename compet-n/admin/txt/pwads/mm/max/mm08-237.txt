  Description :

nice! Potentially the first demo by me actually worth watching.

This demo is now over 1 minute faster then Yonatan's 3:39. 

I like this map a lot and I've been trying to designate it as my map. After watching Drew's
2013mm01 speed exercise I saw a potential shortcut I could use in a max demo. I didn't
realize the invuln could be reached without climbing the steps. So that was all the 
motivation I needed (all I really wanted was under 3:00). Then I watched Chris's mm08f430
and picked up another time saving tactic. I use the same angle Chris does to shoot the
enemies on the armor platform. Where as before I'd approach the switch and either shoot
left or right now I can shoot at a 45 degree angle and get them mostly all in view. 

BTW, if you want to see a lucky demo check out mm08luck included in this zip. Lucky timing 
as I barely catch a lift and kill a caco on my way up just before I get out of view. And, 
of course, the mandatory 1% health finish. =) I swear that I was about 10 tics away from dieing in that lava.
