  Description :

39 seconds faster then Yonatan's 3:39. 

Orin Flaharty designed some great maps for both Momento Mori's and Requiem. 
This is no exception. The design is excellent and reminds me of an episode 
4 type level. Albiet there are a few places where he could have made the 
pathways a bit more navigation friendly. As Yonatan mentioned shooting 
those troopers are just a pain.

[update]
And dammit all. This was going to be a 3:15 lmp. Fine, fine. Then I decide
I want to improve it and try to optimally go for under three. Seemed unlikely
until I developed a few more tricks that garnered seconds. What time do I get?
2:59? 3:01? NOOOO....3:00...argh! Heh. 

A suggestion to anyone who tries to improve: Try and save one rocket for the
pack of lost souls guarding the blue key. I think it would make it quicker 
to get in and out of that area. Also, try not to use too much ssg on those
lost souls because shotgun ammo gets real tight at the end. As you can see
I run out just one ssg shot short and lose the two seconds I wanted. :~(
