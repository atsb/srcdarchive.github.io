  Description : 

I *really* want to like this level. I really do. It's a great level. Except it 
has a faulty teleporter system. It doesn't prevent 100% kills but it effectively
makes it purely random when you'll be able to exit. That's the trademark problem
I always have with Moeller levels. There's some little quirk or gimmick that 
just fucks up a perfectly designed wad. 

Moeller implements coop support and instead of coop support being the same as 
single with more monsters it's basically a different route for coop mode.
This mostly translates into shortcuts for single player. Suprisingly this
'coop support' was not the problem I thought it would be. For all the talk
in the textfiles about it anyways.

The teleporter in question is a series of large box sectors connected together
by two teleport lines at each end. As linedefs are passed/walls fall and monsters 
in further away sectors are now allowed to roam over these lines. Problem is they 
sometimes walk right over the lines without teleporting! I first thought maybe
because it was that monsters were blocking the teleport spot but that proved untrue. 
I still can't figure out why they just walk over it. 

I'd love to try this one in coop though, specifically 4 player coop tyson. Four 
berserks? Oh baby, that is some coop fun! Keep this one in mind for LAN's...
