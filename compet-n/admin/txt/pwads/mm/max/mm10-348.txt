  Description :-)

  17th COMPET-N entry.

  Another nice map from "Memento Mori", in my opinion. Many 
  players don't care for it much... I don't know why I like 
  it, really. Somehow, I find the layout and gameplay very 
  appealing.

  Since I know at least one COMPET-N player likes this map as 
  much as I do, I'd like to dedicate this run to him. Hope you 
  like it, DeDo! :-)

  About the run itself -> Not much to say. This took me about 
  25 minutes... I had a second-best exit of 3:56, so I'm happy 
  about the time. I was very lucky to survive the middle part of 
  this run, where my health was as low as 2% at one time (due 
  to some sloppy playing).

  Credits to Chris "Ryback" Ratcliff, Adolf "Gusta" Vojta, and 
  James "Xit Vono" Leonard for the route. Ryback came up with 
  the original route, then Gusta and Xit both made some changes 
  to it. This demo introduces a couple of additional changes to 
  make it easier to get a good time (e.g. leaving the first 
  shotgun, leaving the soulsphere, and taking the blue armour + 
  backpack).
