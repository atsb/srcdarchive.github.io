  Description :-)

Well here's one that I'm a little happier with. I just wasnt very happy
with the 8:54 I had before this one. I still think that below 8mins is 
very possible. Things went a little better in this one, but I think the 
real time killer is using the invuln. against the pigs and viles/mancubus
in the cage. Its easy to die when you try to run by all the revenants and
mancubus in the first area. The cybie usually made me eat rockets. I had
one completion that was an 8:14, but I didnt record that one :( - oh well.
That'd be it for now, hope the demos are interesting. Think I'm done with
this map...
