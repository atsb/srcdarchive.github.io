===================================
Description:

This run is still a little rough, but my target was under 8 min. I didn't 
completely consume cells before an exit. Infightings between mancubi and 
barons in the blue key's room were so smooth, so I saved extra cells.  
Certainly I forgot to make a plan for the extra cells. but this smooth 
considerably contributed toward achieving my target which was not easy.
