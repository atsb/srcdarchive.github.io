  Description :-)
  
  The teleporter here drives me crazy, never seen such a
  bad design in my life.

  I pressed the switch in this demo accidentally, but
  it isn't needed to finish the level. If you check out the
  area behind the bars, it works like this:
  1) If you cross the bars a little, the teleporter closes.
  2) If you go close to the switch, the exit opens revealing
     the 3 demons.
  3) If you press the switch, the teleporter destination
     closes, which is totally unnecessary because the teleporter
     is already closed.

  This design means you can't open the exit without closing
  the teleporter; or in other words, if you decide to open the
  exit and run for the exit, there could be monsters which
  won't have a chance to teleport. Simply put, a fast 100/100
  time on this level is 90% luck, 10% skill (that's why I needed
  2 days to get this time).

  Oh yeah didn't even mention that sometimes the bars refuse
  to open at all... for whatever reason.

  There's still lots of improvement left (my TAS time is 0:50),
  but there's no way I'm playing this again in 100/100.
