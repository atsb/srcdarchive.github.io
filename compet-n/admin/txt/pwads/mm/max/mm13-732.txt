| The previous record was a rare example of an "intended route"          |
| Compet-N Max. Just beating it was not a problem - many tricks were     |
| used by Oyvind himself in his UV Speed demo. I got some 7:5x with      |
| survivors or 8:0x with 100% kills, so the time surprised me - it's     |
| not a great demo in my opinion.                                        |
|                                                                        |
