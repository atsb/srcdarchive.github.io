               Nice idea for a project, Anthony, I'm glad there are
               other people around to start stuff like this. Memento
               Mori I has always been my favourite megawad from The Innocent
               Crew, distinguished I think mainly by the control and
               restraint of the level authors. Look at the bloat of
               Memento Mori II, in contrast. 

               The current demos can probably be improved substantially,
               they weren't hard-worked like the ones in the final MM2
               demo collection. This is just an initial effort from
               me, as I'm pressed for time... only took ten minutes to do.
               Faster route + get the SSG earlier + more efficient killing
               of the faraway monsters + it's a Yonatan max demo = more
               than two minutes saved. First exit, so under five minutes
               will be easy.
