  Description :-)

  The start of this map is excellent but I don't care for the rest - too
  few monsters for such a large area.  The ending is also rather ho hum
  with an invulnerability sphere and about 3 times the ammo needed.
  I leave via the secret exit which is a rocket jump like E3M6. 80% secrets is
  the maximum.
