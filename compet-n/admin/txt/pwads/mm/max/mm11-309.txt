Description:

Nice atmosphere, I like the map's mus (BGM) very much!
However, this map have a fatal bug...

I have a question "How should I do to get a UV-Max demo?".
This is because I turned out that the rule don't exist for this map.
There is an inaccessible area. However, it's not impossible to
kill some enemies on the area, much luck is necessary though.
Theoretically it is possible to kill all enemies excluding
two monsters. In mm11-610, Peo left four monsters and finished
the level. He had luck, because a shotgunner missed a shot to
his target and hit it to a chaingunner when doing monster-infighting.
Therefore, Peo was able to kill three chaingunners. I think it
seldom happen. At least, it didn't happen when I played with
God mode. And, a few shotgunners might never show up in front
of the player if they goes to the edge of the area.

In my opinion, we should have a complete disregard for all (13) enemies
on the area. Certainly it is possible to kill a few enemies enough, but
the result changes as often as we play it, so we can't do fair competition.
One or two shotgunners might never show up in front of the player once,
because there are two shotgunners in near to the edge of the area from
the first. Or, I might be able to kill one or two mancubi by monster-infighting.
It happens easier than killing chaingunners, but it also depend on luck. Or,
I might miss more shotgunners if I wait for mancubi to start moving.

Here, I did a map 11 demo in my opinion. Of course, I don't know if it is really
correct. I don't mind it even if this demo would be invalid on Compet-N. However,
this is one opinion to UV-Max and Speedrunning.
