===================================
Description:
The key here is to alarm monsters outside as soon as possible.
Which means you have to activate the switch and shoot before the brown door closes.
That way, monsters will have enough time to teleport and zombiemen will pile up at
the door. I don't think this route can be improved. I got quite lucky with monster
infights and actually, if I was a little bit faster the last former human wouldn't
teleport in.
