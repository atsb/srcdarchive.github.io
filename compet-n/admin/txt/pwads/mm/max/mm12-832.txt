  Description :-)
  
  The ugliest map in MM. I did it before we started the collection, because
  there was no previous lmp for it. It's not hard, but very ugly. Maybe there
  are some ammo problems, I know I had lots of ammo, maybe that's because I
  punched the hellknights in the start. There are no secrets here.
