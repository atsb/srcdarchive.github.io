  Description :)

  Damn I got this time 2 times, the 2nd time (this one) is
  the better looking of the two and is slightly faster

  This is a tricky map I wanted to make a good run on
  this map but it's pretty hard, maybe another day
  One obvious improvement is the rocket firing then
  catching the elevator but I can rarely do it and
  kill all the monsters outside
