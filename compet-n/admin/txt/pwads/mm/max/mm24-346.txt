  Description :-)

  A nice Living-End-style map, but Dario did them better in Plutonia :-) So
  many cells for so little monsters, you nearly have enough to kill the whole
  map twice with only cells! (I calculated it with DMTHA, so I don't
  exaggerate here) I ran to the BFG as soon as possible and then fired, fired,
  fired...
