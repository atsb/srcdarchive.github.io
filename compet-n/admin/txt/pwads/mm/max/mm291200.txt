===================================
Description:

Inspired by "DWmegawad Club plays..." I tried Tysons on MAP20 and MAP29
and they both should be easy. Then - what a stupid thought - I decided
to try MAP29 Max.

Pretty much what Anthony said... I'll say more or less the same using
my own words, though...

Design-wise the map is as if it were part of Obituary (obtic.wad). Then
there are pathetic monster teleporters, so obviously the Moellers didn't
learn anything after releasing obtic. Then, 2 monsters are unreachable
and can only be killed by rocket launcher splash damage. Near the start
you get a bonus red skull key, but if you step over it, a caco metal
"cage" will not lower, so you won't reveal a baron needed for 100% kills.
OTOH, if it lowers, it is possible to get trapped inside :-)

Still I like this map as some areas are very, very nice.

I think going for the BFG first is much faster than what Anthony did,
but for most of the time you only have SSG and BFG to choose from,
which may be inconvenient. The demo is bad, normally I would try to
score something better, but there are one or two or three survivors...
practically always. I perform some "magic" trying to stay for a longer
while in certain areas, in which the monsters actually cross their
teleporting linedefs, but usually it's not enough.
