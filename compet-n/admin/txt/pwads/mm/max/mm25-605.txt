  Description :

Chris - thanks for helping with the mm10. Optimization can come
later no doubt. Got any other things you could contribute?

Gah, I'm so fed up with this map. About 8 finishes all attempting to 
go under 6 minutes were either not 100/100% or were over. I just
want to move on. It's just stressing me out so I'll free my hands
of it.
