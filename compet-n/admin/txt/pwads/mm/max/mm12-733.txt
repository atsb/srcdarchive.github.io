Description:

Yonatan had a good demo, unfortunately due to the ugly map design, I don't
think there will ever be a "good" demo from this map...it's just that
horribly designed.

Anyway, Yonatan's demo was kinda layed back, but I'm sure that only a crazy
person would want to actually spend time doing ANY demo for this map...

This can go faster, just need better ammo usage and such...better aim might
help too. My 4:37 Speedrun is much better than this ^^

Also, this is my contribution to Fish's goal of improving the Max-Kill
tables for Memento Mori ^_^
