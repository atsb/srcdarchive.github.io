Description:

I had the same idea as to what to do to the Cybie here, but I'll
give the credit to Eugene since he actually used it in a demo
before me. So, the route credits all go to him.

Same thing, just faster. Dunno where I improved his time at, but
I did....spent about 30 minutes on this, so don't expect much...

For some reason, I couldn't get the BFG to go into the boss's hole
in his forehead to hit the Cybie...but after wasting some cells,
they started going in...and then the Cybie go boom =) And the
people rejoiced...

I'll continue to defend this map to the best that I can, cause
it's a sweet map, I love it ^_^ Probably my favorite map out
of Memento Mori...
