  Description :-)

  The designer of this map is extremely clever.  The placement of the
  megaspheres is ingenious but I show how to reach them.  I like the central
  mansion surrounded by it's courtyard.  The only thing I don't like about
  this map is that all the hallways are so narrow there is very little room
  to maneuver (watch the first Arch Vile trap me). 100% secrets is impossible.
