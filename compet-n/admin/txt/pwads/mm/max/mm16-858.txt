  Description : 

The goal here was to get a proper 100/100% and to get it under 9 minutes. At first
I got a time of 9:29. Twice. Then I watched a Ryback -fast and realized that I 
could use my rockets a lot better. Then I bested my original submission of 9:12 with
a 9:06. Followed that with a 9:05. Then I got a 9:04. Grr. This finally came and
not soon enough. I was at wits end.  

Thanks to Adam Hegyi and Andy Olivera for pointing out and explaning how 
100% secrets is indeed possible.
