Comments:  This isn't a good level for speeding through though
plotting a route was fun.  Limited health and no armor until the end
if one wants to be fast.  I was definitely lucky in the yellow key 
area.  (see mm17-454.lmp included in the zipfile for what usually
happens)  No special tricks other than to not blast the barrel that
one Mancubus is placed too close to.  Anyways, enjoy.
