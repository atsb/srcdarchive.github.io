Description:

First of all, I don't see why this wasn't done. It is a fairly simple level to do,
it's just taking out the Cybie, if you can even call that hard.

I did this on the first try, and I know it's a real long time, the level is kinda
long, mainly because you can spend around 5 minutes hitting the Cyber.

Also, the level is really easy, there's a stockpile of Rockets and Megaspheres. IMO
it's just a slightly rediculous amount of ammo and health in the level. Even though
the level is a tad-bit boring, things can go wrong really easy.

I somehow managed to run out of Plasma fighting the Revenants, luckily they have 1
cell each ^_^ I usually start out by firing at the Arch-Viles from the center, I
make use of those extra Rockets that lay up there.

Good map, too much health and ammo
