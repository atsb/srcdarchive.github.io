  Description: After conversation with Anthony I decided to have a
               go at this.

               Hmm, pity this wasn't one second faster, eh?
               This demo beats Vile's 4:22 because I use Yonatan's
               faster TAS route. I know it can go faster, but this was
               a second try and I was lucky with the infights, so
               I'll leave improving it to someone else.
