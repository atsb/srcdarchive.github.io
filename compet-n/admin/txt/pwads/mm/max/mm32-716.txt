  Description :-)

  8th COMPET-N entry.

  This map, to put it simply, is just wonderful. Extremely 
  cool sequences, good, quick, gameplay and one or two 
  clever secrets far outweigh the flaws -- an illogical 
  progression and some very mixed architecture (no 
  coherence to be found here). I didn't actually get around 
  to playing this, back when I first played through MM, so 
  imagine my surprise at a later date to find such a fine 
  map hidden away. :-D

  I've played this one a million times, it seems, yet I 
  still get lost occasionally. This is a pretty normal max 
  run for me -- I've done it slightly quicker (only I wasn't 
  recording then, d'oh!). It's still pretty okay, though. 
  As usual I make several mistakes here and there, but 
  nothing too costly, I think. I don't know if there's a 
  better weapon usage or a better route... this is just the 
  way I always play it, pretty much. There's so much health 
  here, you can simply throw caution at the wind and charge 
  through. I love it! :-)

  Other notes -> the strange progression is actually due 
  to a design bug. There's a teleporter down in the sewer 
  part which leads to the exit, but it's never made 
  accessible. Wierd. And speaking of wierd, during this run 
  something very wierd happened: a shotgun guy appeared 
  from out of the blue... you'll know it when you see it. 
  I guess it was just a straggler from the starting room, 
  but still, that has never happened to me before.
 
  Credits for the trick jump (near the start) to Anthony 
  Soto.
