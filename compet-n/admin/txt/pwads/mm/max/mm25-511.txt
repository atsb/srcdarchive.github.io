Description:

This map is pretty easy. This is because there are a lot of spheres,
and you can kill The Spider Mastermind safely for some reason or other.
At first, I would enter a 5:21 demo in Compet-N. However, I got a 5:23
UV-fast demo in this map, so I tried UV-Max again and got it.
Btw, I like the map's mus (BGM) very much!
