  Memento Mori - Level 21 - Twilight Lab

  Kills    100%
  Items     ??%           
  Secrets  100%  and Time = 11:48 
                                 

  Description: I was considering doing this level, before Anthony did
               his demo. So I had a couple of route
               improvements in mind, particularly at the end.
               Still, I think 10:00 is out of reach, the level is just
               too big.

               This is a great level with some wonderful design,
               just like the other Memento Mori stuff. But gameplay
               hasn't been juggled perfectly, and it can be frustrating
               trying to speed through the level.
