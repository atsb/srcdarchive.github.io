Description :

To my surprise, I actually beat the old one by 1 second....I was hoping to push
it under 6 minutes, which would definately be nice...but I don't see this
happening from me any time soon. 

I wish this would've been more than a 1 second improvement...but hey, I'm lucky
I got THAT much. I was consecutively getting times of around 6:25...

This map is still a good map to play, ammo balance is nice unless you miss quite
a few shots, then there isn't enough. Lots of health and armor also.

Not much else to say really, other than Fish's demo was a VERY nice demo...really
hard to beat too ^_^
