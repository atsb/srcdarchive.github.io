  Description : 

2:49 faster. Just a great map from Momento Mori (KarmaComa is a cool name too). 
The map kind of reminds me of doom2 maps 13 + 15 with texturing inspiration 
from Dweller2. I love the openness of the map and the action. The tunnel part
isn't to my liking - but it doesn't bring the map down. 
 
Watching the beginning of George's demo is a bit unsettling. His play seems 
erratic. Near the end of his 12:38 he calms down - and from there I basically
mirror his route. I also use the secret exit but, as shown, you can reach it 
with a normal jump and without having to shoot a rocket at the wall. 

80% secrets max possible.
