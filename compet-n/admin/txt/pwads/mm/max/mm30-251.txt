Description:

I've played more reckless. However only 15 seconds were cut. Upload it due to a lack of time. Sorry, but this is my last demo till middle of February. Today I'm going to a trip. But Casey, may be my brother - Sergey will substitute me. Of course in case he will have enough motivation. MM1 is not first among his favorite megawads.
