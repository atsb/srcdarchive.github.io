Description:

Wow, Eugene, you've really impressed me ^_^ This has been a lot of fun, and
it's unfortunate you have to go out of town =( I don't think it's over yet
though, but I've had a lot of fun so far.

This demo was what I considered a perfect (or near-perfect) run for me. I had
nothing go wrong here at all hardly, and the Cacos were pretty much all
clumped together for once (had to chase 3 down I think), and every single
BFG shot went into the brain against the Cybie. Can't ask for much more here
cause I'm really happy about this =)

And this route is Eugene's. I like it, even if it's kinda luck-reliant at times.
The Cacos all have to be really close together, and you really have to aim at
the Archies and not waste too many BFG shots at them...

^_^
