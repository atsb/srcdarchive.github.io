  Description :

1:31 faster. A great map with well thought out layout and good ammo balance. 
Pretty fun to play too. 88% secrets max possible. 

This demo is pretty much a faster version of George Bell's route with two 
notable exceptions. The first is in the nukage cave w/ green armor the imp 
is nice and decides to lower the lift for me. What a gentleman. Also, just 
before I loaded this run up I decided to hold off getting the invuln to 
face the cyber. Mainly I did this because I suck VS. Cybers but I think it's a 
time saver anyways. 

I almost botched up and died in the RL room. I just could not believe I was loosing
such a large slab of health in the exact same place I died in the previous demo.
Managed to break free of that...
