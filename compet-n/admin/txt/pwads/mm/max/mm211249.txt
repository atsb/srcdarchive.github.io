  Description : 

I'm really dissappointed with this time. Surveying this map and planning a
new route I thought I could push the time below 10 minutes. Instead I found
myself struggling to just beat Peo's old time. Perhaps my slightly altered
route is slower but I can't imagine since I cut out redundant passes through 
areas of the map. Maybe Peo has better cell usage, I don't know. 

It also just irks me how, guaranteed (try yourself), if you let the first 
sergeant hit you your health will go exactly to 91%. The route was 
suprisingly easy to learn but my fustration with pulling a good improvement
has forced me to move on to something else for now.
