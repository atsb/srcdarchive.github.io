===================================
Description:
Trying to play some Doom again and see what I've been missing, if anything.
It's still fun, I just took it too far before and obsessed over every
mistake too much.  I'll let the two total whiffs with the shotgun later in
the demo slide this time. ;p

Not much else to say, this can still be improved a fair bit.  The only bit
that I added was the handling of the elevator near the end, avoiding the
wait.
