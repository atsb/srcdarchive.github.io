  Description :-)

  You can change this route in many different
  ways and there won't be a clear faster one
  I've just seen Esko's TAS where he opens the exit
  door and kills the pig inside first before killing
  the outside enemies so the pig doesn't block you while
  he's dying. This might've saved 1 second from this run..
