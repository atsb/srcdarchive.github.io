C-N entry #52.

This is one of Momento Mori's finest levels.. but unfortunately, it's also the
speed-runner's worst nightmare.  Once I begin work on the third episode movie,
this level will be the biggest obstacle to overcome.

As for this run, I'm pretty satisfied with the way it turned out.  I worked on
this run several times, so I know the level very well (however, I still don't
know what all of the switches do. :)
