  Description :-)
  
  A great beginning map, small and fun. The only problem in speeding through
  this is that you have to wait before closing the teleporter, because you
  should let everyone teleport or else you wouldn't get 100% kills. So I left
  some guys in the start alive and went to kill them while waiting for the
  enemies to teleport.
