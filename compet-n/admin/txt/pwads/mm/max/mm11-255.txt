===================================
Description:

I love this map with this music, but this map had fatal bug. There were some 
inaccessible area and some enemies could not be killed. You might think this 
does not look serious problem because those enemies can be excluded from the 
rule. Certainly it is not rare case, but this is a problem which this map had 
that some enemies were almost impossible to kill but strictly not impossible. 
It therefore is very difficult to define UV-Max rule. Fortunately, this bug was 
fixed after Compet-N was revived. fx, really thank you! 

This was so hard until I got a blue armor and soul sphere. There were enough 
recovery items before them and many hitscanners and lost souls always annoyed 
me. My first target is beating my old record (3:09) with correct max. I managed 
to get 3:06 after many attempts, but I was not satisfied with it. This is because 
I wanted to get under 3 min. Certainly I know it is impossible, but it was extremely 
hard in an old route, then I noticed that I could push the switch for releasing 
an arachnotron from a lower floor. This trick was very helpful for under 3 min. 
I just included a max demo in 3:06 with the old route.
