  Memento Mori – Map 24 – NM100S

I like the start and how I could've possibly screwed up there, but didn't. I also miss the chaingunners and I'm also really safe on the barons. I like how I saved time on shots that hit me that send me out of the teleporter. I also didn't screw up going into the chaingunners/plasma room. Sometimes I'd miss the 2nd secret and it would screw up the run. Finally there's the race to the exit. I'd remember getting hit by a rocket so I was a smidge nervous. When I did it, I knew I totally owned it.
