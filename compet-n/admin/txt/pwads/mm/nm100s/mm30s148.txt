Description:

This is really odd. I had a 2:01 run and decided to try to push it below 2 minutes
only to get an improvement of 2:01. Isn't that kind of strange? ^^'

Anyway, I wasn't aiming for this kind of a time to start, just 3:49 was really slow.
This would've been faster but I couldn't get aimed in time to fire the rockets going
up the first time, and I had that Mancubus raining down fire on me throwing me off
center for those last 3 shots....

A normal NM speedrun would be slower than a NM100S one due to where the secret for
the map is ^_^
