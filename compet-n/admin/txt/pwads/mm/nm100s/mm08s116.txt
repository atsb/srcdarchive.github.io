Description:

I said in my 1:52: "I'd say below 1:30 would be optimal ^_^"

Weeeeeeeell......let me correct myself and say that below 1:10 would be
optimal ;) Possibly even 0:5x would be achievable here...I was continually
getting 1:26, but um...I dunno where this one came from. It just seems so
slow when I watched it back ^^'

The previous one was over a year old, and well, after having not recorded
any records for around a month due to being out of town and such, I
needed a project to get myself back into the swing of things...so, enjoy
^_^
