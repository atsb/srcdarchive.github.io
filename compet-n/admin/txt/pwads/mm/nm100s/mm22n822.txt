  Description :-)
  
  You need some luck to do the switch with the imps in the slime.
  I found ssg to be the most reliable here because you can get 3
  shots off.  The first is for the 2 near the switch, then I use
  2 more to make sure that no imps block the lift.  The problem
  with ssg is that you must kill both imps to have a reasonable
  chance.  Also, the room above can be really dangerous with
  respawning monsters.  Fortunately it's the only hard part and
  it's at the beginning.  I think this was the third time I
  reached the red key.  It's also nightmare 100% secrets.
