Description:

3:23 = Me, newbie keyboarder =P
2:14 = Me, sucky mouser.

This was DEFINATELY a close call, and don't ask me what the heck
I was thinking by rushing the Cyberdemon in THAT manner...

Not really a hard map to run on Nightmare, just has a few nasty
spots to make it through.

If it weren't 5 AM, I'd try to make this faster, but I need sleep...
o.o

...and don't ask about the Specter at the Blue Key. He actually was
invisible enough for me to fire at him and be facing AWAY from him...
weird.

Enjoy this, because it's pretty close at the end ^_^

This is also 100% secrets ;)
