  Description :-)

  Well, after the Cyber Awards I felt like recording something,
  so I decided to try improving the NM100S record for mm08.

  It didn't take too long to break the minute mark, but I decided I
  wanted to do better. So I've been playing a little bit now and then,
  getting a :46, then a couple of :45s and then this demo.

  There's still a little bit of getting stuck at the Lost Souls, so I
  thought I'd try for a :43, but I haven't had any luck. So since I'm
  about to start my master thesis I guess I might as well upload this.
