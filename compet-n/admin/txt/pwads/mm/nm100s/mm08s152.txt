Description:

This was kinda frustrating to do. I came up with the route, from start to
finish. The ending I used the Speedrun route, with the ledge-jump thing.

The only real difficult part is probably in the middle with the Cacos. I
always somehow managed to screw it up and blow myself up with a rocket -_-'
Needless to say it got pretty old after a while of doing that...

One reason I decided to use the speedrun route at the end is because the area
behind the Red door usually killed me...you know, the 3 Barons? >.<

I'd say below 1:30 would be optimal ^_^
