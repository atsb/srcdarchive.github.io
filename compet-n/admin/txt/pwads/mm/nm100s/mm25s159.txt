  15th COMPET-N entry.

  Is this the easiest NM100S run in COMPET-N? Perhaps. I tried 
  this for 25 minutes and had exactly two failed attempts: one 
  because I didn't get to the last lift before the 30-sec doors 
  closed (embarrasing, I know), and one because I planted a 
  rocket in my face in the staircase after having wasted the 
  Arachnotron.

  It didn't take long to get a 2:07 here, so of course a run 
  below 2 minutes flat was tempting. To achieve that, I made 
  a small adjustment to my previous tactic, by opening the 
  twin doors while waiting for the lift to the red key, and 
  it worked on the second try. :-)

  I didn't bother improving it further, although I'm quite 
  certain a time in the 1:35-1:40 range is possible with 
  gutsier play. There are several mistakes in this run. For 
  example, I lost some time while grabbing the rocket 
  launcher, and I got stuck on a few spectres.

  Thanks to Casey Alvis for most of the route. I did make some 
  adjustments to save time, but he really laid the groundwork.
