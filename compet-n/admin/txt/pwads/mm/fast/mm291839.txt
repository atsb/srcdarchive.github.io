  Memento Mori – Map 29 – UV Fast

The last map to be completed on UV Fast as of yet, and I finally did it. The first part with a switch that opens a door with shotgunners, I was lucky as a gunner was under the door as it was closing, so it opened up again. At the soul sphere part, I ended up having too much propulsion and missed it. Also, in the tiny hallway leading to the room with the megasphere secret, a cacodemon blocked my way, so I had to use a rocket to get rid of the blockage. Optimal would probably be 16:xx.
