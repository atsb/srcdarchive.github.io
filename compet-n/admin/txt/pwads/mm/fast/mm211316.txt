  Memento Mori – Map 21 – UV Fast

After seeing SAV88's max run on this map, I decided to try out a UV -Fast run, and it actually turned out better than I originally thought. I used some of his tactics (for example, the start) and then after that, I decided to fuse a bit of both of his and my strategies together and I get a time that's almost 6 minutes faster than Ryback's run.
