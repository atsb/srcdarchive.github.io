  Description :

               The beggining can be hell if you want to do it fast on -fast.:) To get past                 the three Cacodemons is very luck dependent, the rest of the map is rather                  easy if you don't make big mistakes. That's funny because I wanted to record                for this map for a long time but allways thought that it's long and hard.                   Definately one of my favourites from ep1 so I'm happy that i could record the                first -fast demo for it.
