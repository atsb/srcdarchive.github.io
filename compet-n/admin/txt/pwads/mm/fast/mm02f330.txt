Description:

First successful exit. This can be a tough map on -fast if you don't know what
you're doing.

I was working on this map on Nightmare! but I kept dying at the Red Key...so I
decided to check out the -fast time. Ryback's 4:07 was nice but it was slow,
and I felt the need that it should be faster ;)

And I kept missing that last SG in the secret area...jeez...lost about 5 seconds
there -_-'

The only trouble area is the Red Key area...Demons and Specters galore ^_^

Route credits go to Chris "Ryback" Ratcliff
