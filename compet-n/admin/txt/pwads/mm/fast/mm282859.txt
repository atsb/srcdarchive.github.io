| Believe it or not, I expected an even better time at the exit. But I   |
| won't complain :)                                                      |
|                                                                        |
| There are two tricks used here which are quite unlikely in UV Max.     |
| 1. I fight the last cyber from INSIDE the building.                    |
| 2. After BK when two archies should teleport and resurrect dozens of   |
|    monsters sometimes one of them attacks me and does not teleport.    |
|    Like in this demo...                                                |
|                                                                        |
| I still didn't watch thoroughly Vile's and Istvan's demos (well, I did,|
| but it was a long time ago), so maybe I missed something route-wise.   |
|                                                                        |
