  Description: Great map! It's just me, my Shotgun/SSG/Chaingun and the monsters. Exactly                  how I like it.
               The are two things I realy don't like in this demo:
               1-A shotgunner opened the door for the Hell Knights. During practice runs                     that happened only once so I wasn't fully prepared for that scenario.
               2-I forgot a switch. Luckily it didn't cost me very much time I think some 10                  seconds.
               Another thing is the blue key but I rarely took it on first try so that                     is ok with me.
