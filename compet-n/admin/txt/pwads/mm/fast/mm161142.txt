  Doom2 -file mm.wad -playdemo with version 1.9

  Memento Mori – Map 16 – UV Fast

A good demo, to be honest. I had thought about doing this some time ago simply to make a valid -fast demo for this level, but I never expected myself to beat Ryback by 3 minutes. This is made possible by using more aggressive strats like in the twin arch-vile area.
