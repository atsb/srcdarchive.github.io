|                                                                        |
| Much easier than expected. Plenty of cover, ammo and even health.      |
| If only it were easier to memorize :)                                  |
|                                                                        |
| I even tried to improve the time, but after dying at 20:00 and later   |
| 30:00 I think the improvement must be postponed. A pity, because the   |
| latter would last about 34 mins. and featured a recently popular       |
| arch-vile-killed-in-3-SSG-shots. I'll return to this map one day :)    |
|                                                                        |
| I think MM2 MAP22 would be much more difficult (shitty weapons at the  |
| start, no armor). I also tried MM2 MAP28 just for fun. It is 40 times  |
| more difficult than this one :) If someone pulls that off, it would be |
| fascinating to watch.                                                  |
