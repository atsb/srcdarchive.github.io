| As I like this level very much, I decided to record another demo, this |
| time with -fast monsters. Thankfully the stairs leading to the RK can  |
| be raised by pressing a normal brick wall, so I left the demon/spectre |
| horde until the end (plasma rifle is vital there). UV -fast plays      |
| better on this map than UV Max, as there are no problems with 99% kill |
| runs.                                                                  |
| Compared to Revved's run, I obtain the SSG faster and use it on four   |
| revenants and one of the sentinel hell knights, I get the soulsphere   |
| right away ignoring my not-so-perfect health %, etc. Below 10 minutes? |
| If only I had a plan what to do with the chaingunners guarding the     |
| exit... I think a huge amount of time was wasted there.                |
