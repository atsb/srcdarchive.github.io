Description:

Had some trouble with the Cyberdemon, for some reason I couldn't get
the BFG to go into the demonspitter's head like it usually does, it
kept pounding the walls of the hole. And then I came down to 16%
health and had to retreat for a Megasphere.

And yes...those Imps are STILL a pain... ^^'

At least it's below 4 minutes now ^_^
