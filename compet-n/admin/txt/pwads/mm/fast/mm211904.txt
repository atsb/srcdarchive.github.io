  Description: A tough level on -fast, I tried to get it when I was doing
               all those mm -fast recordings last year, but gave up.
               Doing the max record got me trying again. Most of the level
               is tight but not hard, the problem area is the caco/PE trap.
               I thought of several strategies for this area, then came
               up with what I thought was a perfectly safe method.
               It was only in this demo that I realised it didn't work :)
               So on to plan B. Health took a hit, but I made it, and the
               rest of the level is simple.
