  Description :-)

  13th COMPET-N entry.

  Made another run of this great map, this time trying out 
  the -fast parameter. I believe it's my first released 
  -fast demo, actually. It's not bad, but I still think it 
  has way too many mistakes... I like my UV max run much 
  better. But hey, half the points = half the effort, 
  right? ;-)

  The start is quite dangerous -- lethal, even. Once you 
  get to that first megasphere, though, this run isn't much 
  harder than the max run, just like Ryback said. With so 
  many powerups (3 megaspheres, 3 blue armours, and five 
  soulspheres) you can almost always play as recklessly as 
  you can without the -fast parameter.

  In this run I got a very good start, so I was repeating 
  to myself: "Don't screw this up, don't screw this up!". 
  Of course, I then did my best to get myself killed 
  several times, and the ending ... let us never speak of 
  it again. :-P
