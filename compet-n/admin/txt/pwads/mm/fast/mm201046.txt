  Description: This is another one that gave me trouble. 99% trouble. After
               a few failed attempts I checked the level in a map editor.
               Turns out there's a sargeant hidden in a sector of zero
               height, so there's no way to get true 100% kills. There *is*
               an Archvile, so you can get fake 100%, but what's the point
               of that?
