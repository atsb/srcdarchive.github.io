Description:

This wasn't really that hard, just having to aim with the BFG. The
key to hitting is to be facing the Cybie perfectly, but be just a
tiny bit to the right, otherwise your shot will crash into the
hole you aim into. -_-' I have no idea why it does that though.

I thought I had finished off the Demon Spitter after I heard the
Cyberdemon explode, so I jump off of the platform, and then I
realize he's not dead yet, so I had to go back up there and finish
him off.

This could definately go faster, probably even as fast as past the
6 minute mark.
