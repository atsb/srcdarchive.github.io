  Memento Mori – Map 22 – UV Fast

Basically a mix of the Max and NM records of this map. The imp area can be a bit weird in places, however I did it here. I wasn't sure how I managed to survive the soul sphere secret, I guess it just depends on luck and how you dodge the fireballs.The ending is weird, this is actually the first time I did the last room in -fast so I didn't know where to go, but somehow I figured it out.
