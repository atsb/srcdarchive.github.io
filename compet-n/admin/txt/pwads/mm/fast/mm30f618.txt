Description:

This can reach below 6 minutes.

Personally, my 8:53 wasn't too shabby, but I knew I could do better,
so here is a 6:18.

It's always a good idea to go into the Imp with 200/200, or you could
be in for a world of hurt >.< Trust me, I've run this map on -fast
and Nightmare enough times to know that it's almost a must!

For some reason I had a slight problem aiming for the Cyber with the
BFG, which is actually unusual for me now, with the number of times
I've played this map for fun ^-^'
