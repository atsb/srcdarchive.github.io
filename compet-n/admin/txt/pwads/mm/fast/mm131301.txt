  Memento Mori – Map 13 – UV Fast

Yet another table-filler. Obviously, I had to use safer techniques such as killing monsters where they can't hit me. One problem I did have in the route with was the SSG room. I can clear out the revenants and the barons, but trying to kill the demons with an SSG is impossible. Because of this, I had to wait until I got the plasma rifle to go there. This is also means I had to use ammo safely near the megaarmor room. I also had a tricky fight with the Archviles in the orange key room. The last part was kind of tricky because of all the chaingunners. I also forgot how to get those two mancubus in the last room, in a previous attempt so I wanted to make sure I knew. But anyways, only 4 -fasts left? 0_0
