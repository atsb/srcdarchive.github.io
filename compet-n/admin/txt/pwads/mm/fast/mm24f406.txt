  Description :)
  Sorry for not making many demos or youtube videos lately,
  my main computer crashed and could hardly handle DOSBox with out
  extreme lag, and fraps was to week to even launch properly.
  But now I have a new computer so more demos will come shortly!
  By! :)								  
								
								
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 4:28 by Revved.

  Note: Since this demo was recorded with MM.WAD, I suggest you 
        drop by at http://doomedsda.us/lmps/674/mm_allup.zip
        and pick it up if you havn't already. Also, IMO this
        map sounds better with MM2MUS.wad instead of MMMUS.wad
        so pick up MM2MUS.wad at http://doomedsda.us/lmps/675/mm2.zip
        Thank you :) 

  Utility's: Doom Mouse Spinner, you can download it @
             ftp://mancubus.net/pub/idgames/utils/misc/dms015.zip
             (Sorry if link is dead, ftp severs have a tendence to fail.)
  
   
  *Recorded with just MM.WAD but then played back with both MM.WAD and
   MMMUS.WAD. [DOSBox(version 0.73) used]
