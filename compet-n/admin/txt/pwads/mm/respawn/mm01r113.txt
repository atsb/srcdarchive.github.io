  Description :-)

  3rd COMPET-N entry.

  A perfect start to the WAD; quick and packed with action. 
  It's also quite tricky, since you're not provided with any 
  armour and there are hitscan monsters everywhere. Especially 
  the last part can be madness (it looks easy in this attempt 
  but I was usually gunned down). With respawning monsters, it 
  gets even worse... you're ambushed all the time. I had to 
  camp in a corner waiting for the bars to rise, so I wouldn't 
  get any surprise attacks from behind.

  The teleporter bug is not as intrusive as it is on regular 
  UV, since respawning monsters can compensate for those who 
  take "forever" to teleport in. Nice.

  This run went okay. I was aiming for a time below 1:10, but 
  every time I pushed for speed I got killed, or got less than 
  100% kills. Perhaps I'll come back to this map some other 
  rainy day. :-)
