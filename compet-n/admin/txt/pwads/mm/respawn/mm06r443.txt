  Description :-)

  2nd COMPET-N entry.

  "Memento Mori" is my very favourite WAD and this map is one of my 
  favourite maps in "Memento Mori", so I loved making a demo for it! 
  Even if it is purely table filler material... ;-)

  This level is great fun to play, and it is one that "works" (sort 
  of) with the -respawn parameter. You're better off concentrating on 
  the packs of lightweight monsters, and just leaving most of the 
  bigger monsters alone, since you pass over your steps numerous 
  times. Played this one through from memory, pretty much...

  I was aiming for a time below 5:00, which didn't take long, although 
  I did have several attempts with better exit times (4:30-ish) but with 
  less than 100% kills. When you leave as much behind as I do here 
  you're bound to get only 9x% kills most of the time.
