Description:

The ONLY reason I left the lift room was for the kill % because
I was kinda afraid that I wouldn't get 100%. And I did ^_^

I used Yonotan Donner's little ledge-walk thing as a shortcut,
so credits go to him on that.

After playing this level on -respawn it hit me...this level
is absolutely awesome to play on Nightmare...
