  Description :-)

  Another Memento Mori UV -respawn demo, but this time, it's an
  improvement to an older demo.  Casey Alvis's UV -respawn record on
  this level was 5:54, while Xit Vono's UV max record is 4:52.  My
  general belief regarding -respawn demos is that a level's UV
  -respawn demo should never, under any circumstance, be slower than
  its max demo.  And so, I set out to break Casey's record.  In
  retrospect, the fact that I managed to do so isn't surprising.  What
  /is/ surprising is that I set out to get an exit under the max time,
  and instead ended up getting a first exit under 4:00.  I would have
  resumed recording to see how many seconds I could pare off my time,
  and to see if I could make a better-looking demo, but given the
  circumstances, I decided to let it stand.

  In case you're wondering what the hell I'm doing at the red bars,
  I'm activating as many red-keyed sides as I can in a short time.
  This is to prevent a spechits overflow from occurring (resulting
  from a cacodemon or pain elemental floating beneath them,) which
  would cause the demo to become unplayable unless the source port
  used to play it specifically emulates that behavior.

P.S. Good God, the hidden sergeants at the start are annoying!
