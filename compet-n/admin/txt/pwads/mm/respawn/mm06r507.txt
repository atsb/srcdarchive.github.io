Description: 	Well well, just wanted to say hello to everyone there,
		and yes Happy Easter to all of you out ther still dooming.
		This should be under 3:00, so don't look at this one since
		I like this map and I'll do better one but it seems that
		it's impossible to run win98 on my laptop :(
		I made this on xp without my mice, sound & novert utility.
		If I manage to load win98 I'll do all undone respawn maps
		on this megawad. It's kinda old and remindes me on old doom.
		AV, HR2 & similar are just to difficult and boring. :)
		Hehe .... :) Ok, adam, now you can finally update c-n.
