  Memento Mori – Map 19 – UV Respawn

I kept holding off this one for so long because for most of my attempts, I would be able to get out alive but then some damn monster would kill me at the very exit so I would lose hope through that. This one attempt however, does not suffer from that and manages to get out safely.
