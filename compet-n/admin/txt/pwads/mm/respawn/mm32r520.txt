  Description :-)

  Yes, another long passage of time without a new Compet-n demo.
  I was busy with many things, including school, recording
  off-competition PWAD demos, and working on things like Plutonia 2
  and Claustrophobia 1024.  After over half a year of Compet-n
  inactivity, here's a new table-filler for Memento Mori.  Don't let
  that descriptor fool you, though; it's a "table-filler" only in
  that somehow, in the years since Memento Mori demos were first
  allowed in the Compet-n, nobody ever recorded a UV -respawn demo for
  MAP32.
  
  Like Mark Klem's other levels for the Memento Mori WADs, this level
  suffers from gigantism, but not to the extent that his Memento Mori
  II levels do.  The theme is also decidedly random, ranging from wood
  to techbase to marble with very little connecting each theme
  together.  However, it's fun to play.  The only gameplay-related
  flaw I can point out is that near the end, the progression is rather
  awkward, requiring you to run across the whole level to reach the
  exit, although apparently, this is due to a bug that prevents a
  teleporter from appearing.

  Anyway, there are a few mistakes in this one, but hopefully, this
  should be enjoyable to watch.
