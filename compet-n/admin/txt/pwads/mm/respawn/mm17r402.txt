  Memento Mori – Map 24 – UV Respawn

Simply avoiding enemies is the key to getting a good time while still getting 100% kills. I avoid a hell knight, a couple of hitscanners as well as a PE, as well as the knights in the yellow key room. I also don't go into the place with an arch-vile and 4 mancubi because of this.
