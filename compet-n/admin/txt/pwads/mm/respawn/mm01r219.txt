Description:

This level is a difficult run on -respawn...similar to ev02 "Human Barbeque"
because it's loaded with Shotgunners in a tight area, with little health.

Anyway, I'm pleased with the time, even though it could probably be quicker.
Also, the bars with the Chaingunners is random. It lifts when it wants to
lift it seems. I lost a few seconds waiting for them to raise up.

It took me quite a few tries to get this run, mostly because I kept screwing
up or something of the sort. I made it to the exit area a lot of times...got
to the Demons only twice. This was the first time I made it past them. I ran
out of bullets the first time, and the Shotgun was slow to show up...so I
became Demon food ^^'
