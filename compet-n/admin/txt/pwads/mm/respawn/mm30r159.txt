Description:

With the Max-Kill style battle Eugene and I seem to be having, I decided
to go and update the -respawn and -fast records as well.

This is a first attempt, first exit demo. And yeah...11 seconds slower
than the current NM100S demo ;)

And yeah, this is a LOT better than that 4:29 that used to be the record...
Jeez, what was I thinking back then? "Oooh, 4:29, no one can beat that, I'll
upload it and call it a great demo..." Feh, I laugh at my newbish self back
then =P

Enjoy ^_^
