Description:

Well, after having a desync problem because of a recording I did for this map
using Final Doom's Doom2.exe which was a 4:13, I had to go back and do it over
this time getting below 4 minutes.

And it sucks I lost my NM run for this level as well, I had a 0:59 NM run
which I lost due to recording on Final Doom's exe. -_-' Eh, oh well, it wasn't
that great to watch anyway.

Hey, I still managed to get this run done ^_^ And faster than before too!
