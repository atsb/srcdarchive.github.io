Description:

Hey, Jakub..."What now?" This is what, DooMerMan ^_~

I still haven't figured out what causes the lift behind the red door to not work at
certain points in the level...just a bug I can't quite figure out. It only happens on
-respawn style as well....so... @.@'

The time didn't come hard for me, but it's still improvable quite a bit I'm sure ^_^
