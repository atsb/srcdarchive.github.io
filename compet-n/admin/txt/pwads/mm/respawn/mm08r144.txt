  Description :-)

  This is my first exit.  I recorded this because as I described in the text
  file for my MAP05 demo, having a UV -respawn demo which is slower than the
  current UV max record is against my personal philosophy.  Much frustration
  ensued, including some wrestling with my monitor to get it to refresh in a
  way that wouldn't leave me blind for the first half-second of gameplay.
  Other sources of anger included sergeants that occasionally never poked
  their heads up, a door that you can't open while it's shutting because it's a
  switch door for whatever reason, etc.  I satisfied my goal of getting a time
  faster than 1:50, so here it is.  I hope you enjoy watching it a /lot/ more
  than I did recording it. ;p
