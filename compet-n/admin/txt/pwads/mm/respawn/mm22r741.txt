  Memento Mori – Map 22 – UV Respawn

Again, same as Xit's former NM100S run, but a bit more risky. To be honest, it ended up being a lot harder than I thought it would be. The spiderdemon fight kinda sucked, I shot them enough to make them attack me instead of each other. Also the ending, I didn't see a chaingunner that teleported in and I didn't know who kept draining my health to 18% so I was very cautious at that point.
