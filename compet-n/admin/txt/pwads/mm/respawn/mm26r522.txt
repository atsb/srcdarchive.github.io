Description:

This run has quite a few mistakes. I personally am not satisfied with the time, but
hey, I'm just sick of trying to pull this run off.

I'm slow to grab the Red Key, I nearly die several times at the end, I have a few
badly timed weapon switches, and the biggest mistake is where I'm firing BFG into
the door and NOT opening it! >.<

My usual dying place was right after grabbing the Berserk ^^'

I'm happy that it's done and over ^_^''
