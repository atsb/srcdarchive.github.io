  Description :-)

  4th COMPET-N entry.

  More table filler material here. A beautiful and incredibly 
  fun map to play. There are plenty of good traps and cool 
  sequences in this stone/brick base with gigantic halls.

  The vast amounts of ammo and powerups make the level a breeze 
  in UV, but with the -respawn parameter, you still have to get 
  a move on at some points, or else your health will begin 
  dropping in an alarming rate. :-)

  Again, it's wise to leave most of the bigger monsters alone 
  and concentrate on the smaller ones. I especially like not 
  having to kill all those Barons at the end (that's a very 
  tedious and pointless fight!).

  This run is merely a first (valid) exit, so it's pretty rough 
  around the edges. I just kept screwing up in various ways, so 
  I've had enough of this run for now. ;-)
 
  Luckily, I didn't goof around too much during this attempt, 
  though perhaps I shouldn't have switched weapons at all after 
  getting my hands on the plasma rifle. As Drew said in his 
  30mm8356.txt, it's just impossible to run out of cells here! 
  
  I chose to stay a while at the start, killing some respawning 
  monsters, to make sure I got the necessary amount of kills.
