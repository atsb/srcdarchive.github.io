  and Time -  * 6:03 *
              ********


Description:

Heh, 1:04 faster than my last time. This could be faster, definately.

Now, the reason I decided to improve the 7:07 is because I was getting
slightly annoyed with Fish. In IRC everytime he'd talk to me he'd type
"<pause>" every so many words...just because I had a 1 to 2 second
pause in the 7:07 time -_-'

Another reason was because I knew I could do better than that time.

Something else that catches my eye. This is 2 seconds faster than the
current Max, held by Anthony "The Fish" Soto. So I'm now proud of this
run, seeing as how I got it under the Max of 6:05 ^_^

Now what to work on...hmm....maybe I should get back to mm31 in
UV-Speed ^^'
