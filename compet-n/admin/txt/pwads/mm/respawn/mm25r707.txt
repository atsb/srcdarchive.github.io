Description:

This is one of my better runs for this map.

There's an annoying pause near the beginning, it lasts but only a second
or two. It happens because.....my mom was yelling at me -_-'

Yeah, being 16 sucks at times. Oh well.

I get up close and personal on the Mastermind. I was tempted to switch to
fist just for the comedy of it all, but, uh, I kinda didn't...Hell Knight
and Revenant were after me. I might go back and try to beat this one
later, and maybe I'll get a bit creative ^_~

7:07 isn't a bad time for me, I've had worse...and um...I don't know what
I was thinking when I made this...I'm confused throughout parts of the
run ^^'
