Description:

Hmm....this could have looked better.

Nice run, took a few tries, not many. I take out the first room really quickly,
and it seems to just get slow from there.

The route I use for this level is one that basically avoids the middle area,
the Pain Elemental is. I just can't stand him for some reason in this level. I
think it's because I don't have an SSG or Rocket Launcher or anything like that
yet ^^'

Anyway, this isn't that bad...just kinda ugly in places I think. I tried this
on Nightmare and it's gonna take lots of luck. Anyone care to try it on NM? ^_^
