Description:

My first Compet-n entry in quite a while! This one was spurred by
4shockblast's demo drive to improve Cyberdemon531's frequently suboptimal
demos--more specifically, by dew pointing out on IRC that he published
several Memento Mori UV -respawn runs recently. Having done several
myself before, I decided to take a look at his records, and wound up
looking for the earliest map that had one to do an improvement for. It
was on Memento Mori MAP10: The Mansion, in 2:31. He writes the following
in his text file, talking about Ryback's 2:44:

"Really tough run, Ryback did a good job optimizing this run. I play a
bit more aggressively here, and get some pretty good luck. (Not to
mention advanced hud...)"

It bears mentioning that Cyberdemon531 uses a mouse and keyboard, while
Ryback (even today!) uses keyboard only. Not only that, but Cyberdemon531
recorded all his demos in PrBoom-plus 2.5.1.4, which has improved screen
resolution and an "advanced HUD" with a monster counter that shows you
how many kills you've achieved and how many monsters are in the map.

This new demo, on the other hand, was recorded in doom2.exe v1.9, which
has neither. Oh, and because I used it, this demo is legal for Compet-n.
Take that!

All posturing aside, this is about an hour of effort, which I'm
submitting because four extra hours (including breaks) did not get me
exits that were faster. It's a run based as much on monsters and their
respawn timers behaving nicely as it is on actual skill. I basically used
Ryback's route with modifications to account for my using a mouse and
keyboard. I skip the soul sphere, for example, because I can more easily
dodge attacks and thus don't have to tank as much as Ryback does. There
are also some ugly parts here and there, but overall, this run seems okay
to me.

A possible improvement is to skip the out-of-the-way imp in the room
before you descend to the soul sphere secret. I'd have recorded a
successful demo with that improvement by now if I were successful in those
five hours. 2:1x may be possible if luck really goes your way.

Enjoy!
