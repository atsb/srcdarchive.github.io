Description:

This level can be a little tricky on -respawn....I've done it quite a
few tries and made it out alive just this one time. I've never made it
out of the Red Key room alive with the exception of this run.

Traffic jam when I got the Soulsphere, I lost some time hoping I
killed everything necessary before heading to the exit. Also, I had a
problem getting past all those Spectres in the Red Key room, I got
sandwiched by two of them, and I thought I was kinda screwed right
there....but I got past them this time.

It's a fun level, but it's a rather difficult run. The Demons and
Spectres can get in the way at times. ^_^
