Description:

Nothing too difficult, needed something to relieve stress on so I opened
up Memento Mori and decided to do a -respawn demo. Lots of shotgun action
all the way though ^_^

I know there's some overkill, but this is one of those maps you gotta
guess at how many you've killed...it's a very nice Memento Mori map

This demo crashes in timer.exe at 2:31 into the demo ^^'
