Description:

This map remained undone for a long time. I always felt very low health
and pistol ammo would be a problem. Then Kimo Xvirus beat it, so I could
forget about it. This year, Cyberdemon531 discovered that the map is
actually easy. I probably recorded this because of his text file which
IMO showed too much excitement. (I watched the demo and it could have
been 3:35 if all bullets were used on the pigs). My record is bleh.

Old records:

5:37 by Kimo XVirus
4:52 by Cyberdemon531
3:50 by Cyberdemon531
