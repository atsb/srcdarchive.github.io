==============================================

A trivial, slow-paced, pistol oriented Tyson map.
No idea why it has not been done before. I had motivation to
finish this map (to have my first MM demo), but I have no
motivation to improve the time.

Many things went well (revenant/baron infighting, central courtyard
monster battles), so I didn't have to use fists against the survivors,
I had 99 bullets left at the exit.

Oh, and I pressed the SSG switch and did stupid things in the middle
because I am not familiar with this map.
