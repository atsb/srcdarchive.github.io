| Tyson bad news #1: I can't do mm05. Well, I finished it with saves,    |
| but it was a HEAVILY cheated demo, with infighting manipulation which  |
| is unlikely in normal run. Bad news #2: mm08 is even worse, I didn't   |
| even "TAS" it out. I got a cheated demo with four barons left, why, oh |
| why Orin, you put that berserk in skill <= 3 only?                     |
|                                                                        |
| Good news is another Tyson done, this one is moderately difficult,     |
| with saves (not too many) it's easy, in reality something always goes  |
| wrong, even after getting the mega. Very funny beginning, you die 95%  |
| of the time before the red key, but each death is so different from    |
| the others, it is like never-ending fun. It seems like I must stop     |
| talking so much, see you next time...                                  |
|                                                                        |
