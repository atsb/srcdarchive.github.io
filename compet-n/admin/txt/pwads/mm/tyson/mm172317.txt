| OK, so here's another previously undone Tyson. It was more difficult   |
| than I thought; the map has few monsters and some powerful power-ups,  |
| but a few annoying moments as well, mostly the four mancubus combo.    |
| You wish you had 240 bullets for them, but it's more convenient to     |
| spend some of your bullet supply on sergeants, chaingunners and three  |
| (at least two) revenants in high windows (difficult to get them into   |
| fight against anything). This time the arch-vile must have weakened    |
| the mancubi, but there were still four of them remaining. Luckily, I   |
| had quite a lot of health, so I succeeded.                             |
|                                                                        |
| At the very end, a surprise, the last arachnotron won convincingly     |
| against a fresh baron and I had to finish it off with fists. Then, one |
| final monster (a stuck mancubus), I was careful not to touch the       |
| barrel, finally and I made an entire circle around the map, losing     |
| some seconds by mistake.                                               |
|                                                                        |
| Interesting: after 8 minutes I had 62 monsters killed, 26 remaining!   |
| This kind of shows how tricky the red key area is.                     |
|                                                                        |
