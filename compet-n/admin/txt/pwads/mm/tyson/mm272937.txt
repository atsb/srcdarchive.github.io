==============================================

Another monster map done Tyson-style. It was very tempting to try it, since
there is a berserk pack right at the start.

The level may look intimidating, but in fact it is moderately easy; even the
rocket launcher secret, which I was afraid of, can be passed through without
problems. The only real problem is the cyberdemon. Let's face it: one of the easiest.
I am sure that both Requiem MAP10 and Alien Vendetta MAP08 were more difficult (not
to mention E4M6 and E2M8 which are out of my league). Still, my Tyson skills suck
pretty much the same as the other skills, punching cybers in particular. I am normally
able to punch a cyberdemon about 5 times before dying.

This demo went just as I wanted. The biggest upsets were: 2 chaingunners guarding
the soulsphere and the fact I practically wasted the invulnerability effect by spoiling
the jump which should not be problematic at all. The revenants helped me, this is the only
time they severely damaged the cyberdemon (if you watch this under PrBoom+, you may use
-trace_thingshealth 6 option to watch the cyberdemon's health).

The last thing: this was the funniest level to play Tyson-style in the 'above 10 minutes'
category. 

Who knows what will be next? Vile Flesh MAP14 and Memento Mori II MAP23 are on my list...
