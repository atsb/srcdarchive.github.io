Description:

Difficult map to play on Nightmare, in my opinion. Those demons really knew
how to screw me over quite a lot, especially at the Red Key.

I kinda changed my route at the last second in the Red Key room. Originally
I was going to clean out the Specters and Shotgunners, then flip the switch
and clear out a path to the key. But that never worked for me, as I'd run
out of bullet, and a demon from outside would come up beside me and chomp
on me >.< So I just decided I'd grab the key and get out as quickly as
possible. And it worked on the first try too!

While I was at it, I decided to get 100% secrets by grabbing the Soul Sphere
for the exit room, seeing as it can be pretty bad at times ^^' Luckily the
enemies didn't block my access back up that quick lift, or I might've been
ripped to pieces >.<'

I do like this map though! Nice design and architecture ^_^
