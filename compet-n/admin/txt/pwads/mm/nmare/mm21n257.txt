Demo entry #6.

Description:

This level is designed more like Duke3D than Doom! It also somehow reminders me
of New Year.

Nice start of my new dooming year. In spring of 2006 I reached 3:56 with a long
detour to the supercharger and megaarmor early in the run. But on 05.01.2007,
Vono uploaded his 3:57 entry (without that detour), and I felt that an one
second improvement sucks! So I decided to skip those two powerups that take half
a minute to get, and run like hell past all those gunners etc.

It didn't take too long to succeed. I had a horrible load of unluck in the end,
and running from death into the exit was a miracle for me. A hot scene, IMO.

Oyvind Stenhaug had 3:26 in a regular speedrun because he didn't know the right
route. Also double cell ammo helped me to reach my full speed. On UV, Kristian
Ronge's rocket jump allows for a run below 2:30.
