Demo entry #11.

Description:

Escaping this map is really an interesting challenge on skill 5. I started
thinking about it in 2005, and my target times got lower as I improved my
skills: at first I was aiming for about 5:30, later I wanted 4:5X, then I have
found a nice way to run past the spiders and thought about 4:1X, and finally
started striving for 3:5X.

I played this run for many sessions, it took a hell of a lot of excruciating
work to get one exit. But today I don't think it to me that extremely hard, even
though Kristian Ronge (who did a 4:51 speedrun) found it to be a pain even on
regular UV.

A very old demo, but I still like it, despite its imperfection in moving and 
shooting. Enjoy the nightmare!
