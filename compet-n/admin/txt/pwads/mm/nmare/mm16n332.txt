===================================
Description:

2 hour effort. Because there are two blue armors, one next to another,
I skip one for later. I also pick up the partial invisibility.
The megasphere is not that important, but the nearby plasma is...
I once survived without mega/plasma up until demons/spectres.
However, I'm not good at skill 5 so this was too frustrating to try it
more this way.
