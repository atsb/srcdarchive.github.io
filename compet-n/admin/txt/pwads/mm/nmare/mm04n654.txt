  Description :-)
  
  I used to think this was impossible, but then
  I thought I might as well look at it too see
  if it's possible, and it is, thanks to tons of
  health and ammo around.  It certainly wasn't
  easy, as you can see in this demo.  I had some
  serious health problems after the yellow key
  room, but I managed to survive.
