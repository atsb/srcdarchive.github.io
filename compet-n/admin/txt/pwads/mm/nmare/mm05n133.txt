Description:

Heh, this one Erik Alm and I talked about, I think he decided to
let me have the first shot at it though. Maybe because I begged?
He still hasn't figured out how I get past the Demons and that
Caco with no problems...I guess he'll find out won't he? ^_^

Anyway, the run isn't that hard surprisingly enough. I made a
last second decision to come back to the Megasphere, right as I
would go into the Red room. Speaking of which, I always seemed
to have trouble opening the bars. If I didn't have to actually
"open" the bars I wouldn't be getting nailed by the Revenant
behind me.

I used the UV-speed trick, I think Oyvind Stenhaug found it, so
I guess credit goes to him on the trick at the teleporter.

The ending was basically the only place I died. I knew I needed
a Chaingun and I totally forgot about the Chaingunner right
outside the second Red room...those Arachnotrons always killed
me. This is the first run I pick up a Chaingun...and my first
successful run ^_^

One thing I'm curious about...in my mm08s, I had a 1:52, and in
my mm03s, I had a 1:52 on it. Then I did mm03n and got a 1:33,
and now this with a 1:33....hmm....
