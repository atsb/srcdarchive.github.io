  Description :-)
  
  This was annoying.  At first I tried with invuln but it's
  difficult to finish it fast enough.  Without invuln it's
  difficult to survive but to get a fast time with invuln you
  need to get a clean pass on the pigs which is basically what
  you need to survive without it.  So basically if you want a
  good time there's no point to take the invuln.
