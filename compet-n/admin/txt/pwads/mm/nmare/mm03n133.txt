Description:

Now if you really want a difficult map for Nightmare, this is the
map for you! It's slow in the beginning because I am NOT risking
the health loss from the dual Shotgunners in the start. Once I pick
up the Shotgun I kinda speed things up a little bit, until the Blue
Key.

This run is mostly luck in my opinion, I've spent quite a few hours
on it. I had a run end when I was using the Chaingun on the last
Demon in the level and he ate my bullets...and me...killing the both
of us at the same time -_-'

The run I guess was okay overall, I know this can be waaaaay faster,
but I don't have the skill or ability to actually take the level at
that speed. ^_^
