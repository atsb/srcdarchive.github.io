C-N entry #81.

Something closer to :50 is possible with better
monster cooperation, but I'm not interested in
doing so.

Thanks to Casey for pointing out that invuln.,
even after doing several movie runs for the wad
I never noticed it. :)

Also thanks to Erik for his :56 WITHOUT the
invuln, a very cool watch.  This record won't
last long once he sees it. :)
