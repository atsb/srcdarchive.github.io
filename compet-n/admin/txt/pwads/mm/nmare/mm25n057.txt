Description:

Nice map to play on Nightmare, not really difficult, but not
really easy either.

This time definately isn't optimal, but it is for me! I don't
think I can take my time down much farther to really count.
My guess would be somewhere around 30 seconds or below would
be optimal. ^^

The only problem I have with this level is all the visual
problems when you're going through the slime and stuff. Very
annoying at times... >.<

This run won't last too long before someone beats it will be
my guess...
