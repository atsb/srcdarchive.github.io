  Description :-)

  Hehe, so that's what you meant about getting to the mega 100% of the time.
  Never knew about that invul... oh well this is faster even if it was an annoying 
  run.

  Not a pretty run.. at least a stylish 1% health at the mega :P
  Had to play this without sound which annoyed me, especially at the end
  with the switch...
