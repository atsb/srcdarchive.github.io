  Description :-)
  
  I did a TAS demo earlier, but I didn't bother to send it
  to anyone because it sucked and I wanted to do this normally
  anyways.  The hardest parts here are the blue key area, and
  the wooden rooms near the exit.  There's a lot of nasty stuff
  that can respawn up there.  In my TAS demo I went straight to
  the maze from there, but here I chose to wander around to get
  the megasphere and some plasma, which is well worth it.  Also,
  by taking the longer route I make this demo 100% secrets.  The
  rest of the map would be rather difficult without health
  and plasma.  I found a safe way to do the maze up to the last
  switch, but then it's a bit difficult to avoid mancubus and
  hell knight fireballs.  After that I don't know how difficult
  it should be because I didn't practice the rest very much.
  Because of inexperience, I walked the wrong way after
  teleporting to the yellow key, but fortunately I survived.
  In this demo there were many things that went wrong, especially
  at the blue key.  Because of that, I think this demo makes the
  map look harder than it really is.
