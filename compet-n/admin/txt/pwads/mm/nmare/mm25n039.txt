Description:

I absolutely hate my mouse. It wouldn't work right for about 1/3 of the demo,
meaning that when I moved the mouse to turn, I only maybe budged a little in
that direction. It's most noticeable at the start and at the shotgunner, where
I stop short of mowing him down with chaingun.

Not much to say really, I apologize for this being shakey and/or jerky, but
like I said, my mouse is just complete and total crap. It's optical...and if
you people know me well enough, you know how I HATE optical mice because they
are completely unreliable. The laser could simply just stop working (it's
happened a few times on recent demos of mine), or when you move the mouse,
the motion doesn't register and you simply stand there (also happened). Oh, did
I mention how the fire button only works about 80% of the time now? Oiy...I'm
surprised I was able to get this sub-:40 with this piece of crap >.<

Other than ranting and being pissed off about my mouse, I guess this demo is
satisfactory...
