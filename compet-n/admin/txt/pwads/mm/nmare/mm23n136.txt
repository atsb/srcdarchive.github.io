Demo entry #9.

Description:

Unlike Andy Olivera, I don't think this level to be bland visually. This nice
bright map looks somehow like an airport to me.

The time improvement is based on a more straight running through hordes, such as
the demon group near the end. This run is easy compared to most other PWAD
levels on Nightmare, you don't need to play it too carefully.

Already in 2005, with my wimpy old control which allowed to straferun in only
one direction, I recorded my first ever Vile-beater, MM23N151. When I got
better, I had to rerecord it in a better time. Got 1:44, but in 2007 I
rerecorded it again :-)
