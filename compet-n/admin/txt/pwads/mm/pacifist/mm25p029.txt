  Description :-)

  This demo has been sitting on my hard drive for a long time now,
  since I wanted to improve it some more (got stuck at one point,
  and had to wait for a while before getting hit at the exit).
  However, I'm tired of getting smacked by the revenants, so I'll
  just upload this for now.

  It's possible to grab the soul sphere while waiting for the
  elevator leading to the red key, but after a while I decided to
  leave it since I sometimes ended up at the exit with too much health
  left for the slide to work right away.
