  Description :-)

  I use the same route here as in mm05-050. Some more
  luck is needed with monster placement.
  I had a really good attempt where I was able to get
  past the first demons without getting stuck at all,
  but unfortunately the caco/arachnos in the final room
  wouldn't let me past (see mp05-103.lmp)
