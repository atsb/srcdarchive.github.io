Description:

Not much to say about this run. It's just the UV-Speedrun on Pacifist ^_^

The only thing to really present a problem on Pacifist is getting past the
Shotgunners where the Rocket Launcher is. Sometimes all the enemies will
be in the way and others they'll be out of the way and you can run right
on through to the last area where the Revenants, Mancos, and Archie lurk.
They're not bad, just run past them. ^^

Optimal would probably be either equal to the UV-Speedrun time or 1 second
below that time.
