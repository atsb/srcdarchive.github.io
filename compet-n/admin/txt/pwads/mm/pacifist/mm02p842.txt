Description:

Lots and lots of infighting here. Just hope that the Imps and Demons/Specters
stay at a somewhat even number. Too many of one or the other was trouble for
me here.

I played really safe here, trying to get the enemies to infight as much as
possible, so they wouldn't trap and kill me later.

Red Key part was pretty much the easiest in the whole map for some odd reason
this time around. I was a little hesitant going into that area, and I don't
know why...I run in and get stopped by 2 Specters, so I backtrack out and
wait for them to get out of there.

The hardest part is probably having to lure all the Imps off of the last
bridge to get across it without being Imp-raped...just kinda have to be
patient with them and use the door and elevator and hope they head out the
door =P

And I have a nice close-call exit... 1% health ^_~

BTW, this demo crashes timer around the 5:15 point, but it will play back in
everything else ^^
