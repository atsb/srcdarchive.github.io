  Description :-)

  My first COMPET-N entry!

  I was watching some MM pacifist runs today, and noticed an improvement 
  was clearly possible here, so I loaded up old doom2.exe and an hour 
  later, here we are... :-)

  0:20 was as unexpected as it was welcome. ;-) I had two 0:21's at that 
  time, but in both of those runs I got stuck at the demons, so I just 
  wanted a clean 0:21 run... then this came along.

  Note a slightly new tactic here, which is beneficial in UV pacifist runs 
  as well as UV speedruns: I wake up the imp below the stairs early (by 
  shooting the wall), which is extremely helpful, as that imp will often 
  have moved out of my way as you reach that point. This demo is of course 
  still slow, I completely missed the start for example. 0:19 will be easy 
  for any good speedrunner. The optimal time for this map is at least 0:17, 
  I think. 

  Credits for the switch trick at the end should probably go to Michael 
  "Migru" Grube, who used it in his demo of this map in the mmdemoup 
  collection. That demo precedes Istvan's mmuvlmps-demo by several months.
