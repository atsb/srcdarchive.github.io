Description:

I tried pacifist on this map soon after I completed m201p run. I tried to push out a pinkie from the exit room then. No luck though.

I get a demo extremely easy this time. I've spend literally 15 minutes on this demo. I'm still not sure if it's possible to push out a pinkie in reasonable time. However the last two demons is another story.
