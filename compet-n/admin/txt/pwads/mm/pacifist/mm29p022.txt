  Description :-)

  I actually did this before the weekend, so I
  haven't had the chance to see Altima and Erik's
  demos yet...

  I don't know if anyone else is aware of that
  last hidden switch, but it might be helpful if
  anyone is going for the speed record. I think
  I saw it in an old Max demo, so credits should
  probably go to Istvan.
