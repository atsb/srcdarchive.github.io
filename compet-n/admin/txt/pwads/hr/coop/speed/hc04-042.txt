  My second entry...


  [ DooMerMan ]
  First we tried combination - me do archiejump and all the level :)
  and McRocet do that he don´t died by Cybie´s hand.
  But after 3 succesfull archiejumps and 3 Green marines down - we
  did nontrick keys combination, safes about 1 or 2 seconds but if
  it do someone without any errors. So :34 would be possible. 
  My first entry was hr04-041, so ... Enjoy odd demo from McRocet´s
  view :)
