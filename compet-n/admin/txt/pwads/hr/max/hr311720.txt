  Description :-)
  
  Yes, there is a trick to avoid fighting in the lift. But I didn't use it.
  This is the way to do this level, fight it out in there. The ammo in the
  start is essential if you start from scratch. It's easy to die because
  there's no armor, but I wanted it to be hard. I leave through the secret
  exit (jumping on the columns isn't easy).
