  Description :-)
  
  Not that I don't care for Revenant missiles anymore, but have a friendly
  Cyberdemon at one of the Imp teleport exits. As I checked with iddt I realized
  that the second Cyberdemon was very close as I decided to step onto the
  Supercharge. It was the first time I released the Cybies to this side, because
  they didn't spend many rockets if they were on the other one. I don't know if
  something still can be improved here, I doubt it (but maybe Yonatan has got
  another idea?). I like the time.
