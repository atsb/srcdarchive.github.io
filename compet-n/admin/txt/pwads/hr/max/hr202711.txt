  Description :-)
  
  Pretty hard map with some typical Yonatan traps, like an angry Archvile
  that appears when you take the rocketlauncher. This map is also made for
  creating monsterfights. The Cyberdemons are hard here and it doesn´t feel
  safe until the exit area, which has the neccessary space to control the
  game. It has a nice invisible bridge just before an Archvile trap.
