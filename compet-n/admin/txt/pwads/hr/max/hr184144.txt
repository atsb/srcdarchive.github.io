  Description :-)
  
  This map has 143 Revenants! That will tell you a bit about the difficulty.
  I have 2 favourite areas, first the megasphere area with some beautiful
  effects in the darkness, check it yourself, it is close to the start! Then
  the large area with 2 Spiderbosses, beautiful, it is not very easy to get
  that far though! The tip is just to try to stay alive ;-). Oh yes, it has a
  pretty scary start if standing next to a Cyberdemon is scary.
