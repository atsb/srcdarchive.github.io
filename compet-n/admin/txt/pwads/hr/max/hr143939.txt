  Description :-)
  
  Wonderful map to play but oh so hard. It has some very nasty Cyberdemons in
  close combat and a vicious yellow key trap. The design is lovely. Some
  tips: Make the first Cyberdemon busy by fighting other monsters, on this
  lmp he actually gets killed by them, mainly from the Arachnotrons I believe
  since they are very effective monster killers. I have only made this map
  twice in many tries, so I recommend an easy difficulty setting unless you
  are very skilled. Some parts of this lmp aren´t probably exciting to watch
  but they are needed for survival. You should really try to create
  monsterfights because there are many willing combatants. It has a very hard
  jump which takes a near perfect strafe run or a strafe on run to make, plus you
  have to stop right away when you have reached the first ledge, it took me
  over a minute of trying in this lmp. Fastest way of making this map would
  probably be to create some disturbance in the midarea, take the
  invulnerability and get the rocketlauncher, jump to the blue key and get an
  archvile hit that throws you back on the ground, that will of course mean
  that you will face a Cyberdemon without protection in a tiny room. It is
  possible but I chose the safer way..
