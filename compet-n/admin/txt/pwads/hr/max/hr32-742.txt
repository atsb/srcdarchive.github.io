  Description :-)
  
  This is an extremely tough level, also the one in which I implemented the
  most tricks (the bridges you can go both above and under, the arches, the
  exit, the HOM-blocker). The most violent level in Hell Revealed. I died a
  lot here, but still enjoyed playing it, because there is action all the
  time, so many explosions and attacks all around me. Here also 100% kills
  doesn't mean much, but here also I got it anyway.
