  Description :-)
  
  Thanks for a VERY good wad Yonatan, this is extacly the kind of wads I like..
  Took me some hours to make this one, once you've learned the level and found a
  good route it's a lot easier though.. My first complete 100/100 recording was
  at 42 min... However, I thought it was kind of slow so... I made it again..
  faster. I think one should save the plasma for the Cyberdemons, mainly because
  they can take almost 50 rockets and it's quite dangerous to use rockets only
  (sooner or later you make a mistake when using rockets).. Compared to level 32
  Plutonia and Punisher.wad I think it has the same
  "can't-stop-playing-this-level" feeling.. I don't know if it's harder but it's
  still very hard if you don't know extacly what to do.. Personally I think this
  is the most enjoyable wad of the ones you've made Yonatan, it's maybe not the
  hardest but it's easily the one that is the most fun to play..
