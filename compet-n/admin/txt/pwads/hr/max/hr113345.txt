  Description :-)
  
  A pretty straight forward map that probably looks harder than it is. There
  are plenty of areas with natural shields and the 3 Cyberdemons and the
  Spiderboss are not that difficult. The most difficult monsters are probably
  the Archviles. My favourite part is the wooden towers with the lifts in the
  first Cybie area, beautifully designed. The only tip I can give is to use the
  Cyberdemon as an extra weapon in the bfg room..
