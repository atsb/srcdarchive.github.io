  Description :-)
  
  Haggay's latest level. An easy start if you use the radiation suits, but the
  labyrinth can be very hard. I tried several times to kill the cyberdemons
  closely and kept dying, this lmp is the result. Tons of hiding and SSG usage
  from far range in there, it must be one of the most boring lmps ever. But an
  additional megasphere would have really helped me - I told Haggay that, but
  he didn't listen :)
