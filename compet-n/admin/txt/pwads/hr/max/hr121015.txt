  Description :-)
  
  This map is the easiest of the maps I recorded and most maps after this are
  pure hell. Things can still go wrong, especially in the room with some
  Barons/Hellknights and Archviles. There is only one 100% armor and one
  soulsphere so conserve your health. I really like the part where (I think
  there are 9) some Barons come out from the marble walls one after another
  and you only have the time for maximum 4 ssg shots before getting attacked
  by the next..
