  Description :-)
  
  Hope I missed no monster, I've checked with IDDT, some Lost Souls out of the
  map was all I've seen. Had some luck at the red door, but this way is best :)
  Have the Cyberdemon fire at the Mancubus make meanwhile a 2 BFG kill.
  Sometimes I killed the teleporting Spiderboss with only one shot, maybe 1 out
  of 4. The time improve-ment is caused by the better handling of the Pain
  Elementals and the (long lasting) internal fight Archviles vs Cyberdemon on the
  bridge. And of course the monster-mix near the exit. I tried to have the
  arachnotrons there too, but it was nearly impossible to clean out the red
  key area then. I wonder who killed the second Spiderboss there. So, think
  it's a nice map, but I'll stop now playing it. Dunno if this time will ever
  be improved, since I am still the only player for it ... I hope that
  changes. Everything less than 30:00 is really good here.
