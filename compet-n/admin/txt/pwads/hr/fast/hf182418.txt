  Hell Revealed - Level 18 - Hard Attack     

  Kills    100%
  Items     ??%           
  Secrets  100%  and Time = 24:18

                          
  Description:  I like this strategy for killing the Cyber, very non-labor
                intensive for the player... Tried to push this for time,
                but there's obviously a few more seconds to be pared down.
