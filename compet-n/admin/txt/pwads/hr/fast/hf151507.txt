  Hell Revealed - Level 15 - Gates to Hell     

  Kills    100%
  Items     ??%           
  Secrets  100%  and Time = 15:07

                          
  Description:  This can be a strange level to run, in that the time is
                dependent not so much on how well you play, but how
                well you know the level. I think I've played it long
                enough now to know where all those teleports take me,
                and some fairly quick kills pulled the time down.
                Route pretty much from Claudio.
