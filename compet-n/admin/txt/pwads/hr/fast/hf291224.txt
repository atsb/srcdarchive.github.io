  Description: There's more timewasting in this demo, although it's my fault
               this time. I forgot you needed to trigger a linedef to
               get the Cybers to teleport in, and so there's more than
               half a minute of me looking stupid. In fact really pushing
               here you could probably go below the max record. My
               route is optimised for infights and ammo usage, and it's
               pretty much Claudio's invention, so thanks go to him.
