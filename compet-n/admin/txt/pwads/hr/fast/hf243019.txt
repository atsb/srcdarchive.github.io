  Description: Well, somebody was going to do this sooner or later.
               The key is to quickly get somewhere you can easily
               defend. For this level, the best place is the long ledge
               with all the demons. Thereafter it's mop-up time. It also
               helps to get the BFG straight-off. Made sure all the monsters
               teleported in - but I don't know where that chaingunner
               came from...
