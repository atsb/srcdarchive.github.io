  Description:  This level is intriguing and difficult, and I don't
                think I've completely conquered it yet. I tried to
                press ahead at every stage and health troubles
                make this fairly exciting to watch, but what the route
                really needs is an early grab of the yellow key, so you
                can utilise some Cyber on Manc fights. But there's a lot of
                monsters to be gotten out of the way first, and diving
                straight behind the yellow key door is pretty risky.
