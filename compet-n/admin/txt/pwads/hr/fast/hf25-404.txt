  Description: This demo was the result of some competition with Claudio.
               I'm very happy with the time, below the max record, as it
               should be on a level with the possibilities for infights
               this one has. It doesn't look so hard in the demo, but if
               you try and play it you'll find out death can come from
               absolutely *anywhere*...
