  Description: All hail the mighty -fast. I watched Opulent's max record
               for this map, and after playing through basically his route,
               got nearly a minute and a half faster. Some lucky rocket
               dodging here and there, but the whole thing only took
               fifteen minutes to record, so you can try your luck a little.
