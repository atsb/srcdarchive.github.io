  Description: I do like this level. I thought it would be easier at the
               start if you took out the first group of revenants with BFG,
               so they don't bother you later. Rest of the level I'm happy
               with, although the last lot of Cybers could have been handled
               with a bit more courage, and I forgot the red key at the end.
