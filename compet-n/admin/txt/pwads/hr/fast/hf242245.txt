  Description: Was never happy with the time on my last recording here,
               but then nobody's bothered to beat it either :) My normal
               route at the start here was to use the invuln time
               to release the revenants, and since that didn't happen
               in this demo you could gain a minute easy. With the slightly
               sloppy handling of the end it should be quite easy to get
               below 20min here.
