  Description: Was surprised by the time improvement over Anders' record
               I think it's mostly from the fact that I limit my
               visits to the moat area and just work with the cells as they
               come. Final area is usually tricky but here everything
               just lined up to die - even the archie lift into the
               moat was controlled, I just needed some ammo.
