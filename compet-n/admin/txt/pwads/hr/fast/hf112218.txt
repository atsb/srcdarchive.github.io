  HF112218.LMP - Ultra Violence with -fast

  Recorded using Doom2 Version 1.9
  Doom2 -File HR.WAD -PlayDemo with Version 1.9

  Hell Revealed - Level 11 - Underground Base

  Kills    100%
  Items     ??%           
  Secrets  100%  and Time = 22:18

                          
  Description:  This demo could be faster; unfortunately for me,
                the Cyber turned out to be very inefficient at killing
                things in this demo so I had to waste a lot of rockets.
                Good level for -fast though, as you're never exactly
                safe...
