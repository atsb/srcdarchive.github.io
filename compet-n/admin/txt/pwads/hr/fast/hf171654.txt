  Secrets  100%  and Time = 16:54

                          
  Description:  This is more than nine minutes faster than my last demo,
                which I was really surprised by. Guess my strategy for
                killing the spider must really save a few seconds (this
                is the first time I tried it). Rest of the demo looks good,
                though I really *should* have died at the blue key :)
