  Description: This was not easy to get. Worst part is the start, where
               you're a puny little weakling up against a pack of
               schoolyard bullies. One mistake, or just bad luck, will
               kill you. Fortunately they're very dumb and
               will happily kill each other. I came up with a good
               technique to get rid of the barons in the towers (the
               cacos helped out nicely :) which makes the next bit not
               so annoying.
