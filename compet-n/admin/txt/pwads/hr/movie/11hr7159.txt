Description		: This is a LMP file showing me complete Hell
			  Revealed episode 1, all 11 levels in one demo,
			  completing every level with 100% kills and 100%
			  secrets (except level 3, damnit it's my level so
			  how could I forget secrets there? Must be
			  premature senility.)

			  Maybe you want a timetable:
			  (No special ascii codes this time, sorry!)

			   Some short comments about some of the levels:

			   01 - I didn't delay where I didn't need to delay.
			   02 - I brought all monsters together in the
				beginning because I didn't want to waste time
				going through the level stage to stage later.
			   03 - I don't know how I could miss a secret in a
				level I built, but here is the proof.
			   04 - I show my great talents, killing a single imp
				with 6 shotgun shots
			   05 - Originally there was supposed to be an arch
				vile in the end of this one, but I forgot to
				put him there.
			   06 - If I were 3 seconds faster I would have done
				it under 10 minutes... There is a nice jump
				from the red key to inside the building. And
				there is also a nice jump generated by the
				arch-vile ;-)
			   07 - Big mommy spider dies pretty quickly.
			   08 - I didn't want to let the demons and imps
				fight like I did in the single-player demo of
				this level in hrep1.zip, so I killed them all
				with rockets.
			   09 - Too much ammo. But anyway it was one of my
				first levels, when I still was a really bad
				player without even separate strafing keys,
				and I suppose then it seemed hard enough then.
			   10 - In this level something very cool happened.
				I don't know what it was, but SOMETHING was
				preventing the door in the hell knights room
				(with invulnerability) from closing, but
				there was nothing there! Then I shot the two
				sides of the door and it closed. Then some
				lost souls that flew out of the map made
				noises, and all together it really gave the
				level a creepy, haunted feeling. I loved it.
			   11 - I probably finished with too much ammo. I
				used the mouse for some jumps so don't be
				confused - I'm a keyboard player but the
				mouse is working so I used it here because
				of the faster strafe on it has.
