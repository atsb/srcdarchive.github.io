  Description:

  I played this map for nearly 5 hours to play it at this time.
  With -nomonsters parameter my best time is 0:35.

  I knew that this could be record right after I picked up a yellow key, and I was quite nervous,
  at most at the end, where Cacodemon could srew it up all. :P
  It already happened to me, once I got 0:38.11 and I lost nearly a second at the Cacodemon :|
  
  BTW.: Altima, congratulations to your hr02-128.
