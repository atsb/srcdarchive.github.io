  Description:)
  
  Hello everyone! 
  
  Well, after having died like 2 or 3 million times I finally found myself having 
  the enough amount of luck to send my first demo to C-N (hope everything is correct).
  I know this one sucks technically, but the fault is yours, for not having done this 
  one before. Come one guys, don't let this thing enter the C-N record database! 
  I DID it, it can't be that hard!
  BTW, this is also the NM record for this level, do you think it's possible a 
  "pure" NM run here?
