C-N entry #1.

Description: Yep, my first C-N entry is a paltry filler demo, oh well.  Before this I hadn't even heard of respawn category...Just a crappy first exit, a good time would be around 1:25 I think.  This is my first demo recorded on the classic DooM engine, so I still have to work out a few compatibility problems, notably the lack of sound and random mouse jerks (Most noticeable around the 50 sec mark when I miss the 2 sergeants completely.)
