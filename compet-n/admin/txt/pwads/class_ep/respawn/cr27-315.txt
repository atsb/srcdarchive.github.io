  CR27-315.LMP - Ultra Violence - Respawn      

  Recorded using Doom Version 1.9
  Doom -file Class_Ep.Wad -playdemo with Version 1.9

  Classic Episode - E2M7 - Deimos Anomaly

  Kills    103%           
  (Items    ??%)          
  Secrets  100%  and Time = 03:15 
                            
                          

  Description: Yep, it's even good for respawn. Probably it would be
               safer to just head for the exit and pick off the respawns,
               but this way is quicker.
