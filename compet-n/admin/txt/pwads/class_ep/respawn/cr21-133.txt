  Description :)
  I just wanted to try out uploading a demo to the new COMPET-N web site
  ( http://www.doom.com.hr/compet-n/ ) and so I picked a map I knew I could
  easily beat. I at first was really disappointed with my times (like 1:40)
  and I wanted to beat the UV-MAX record of 1:29 by Radek Pecka. I quickly
  realized that that was out of my league but I still wanted to improve my
  1:40, 1:33 came as a surprise though. I'm actually pretty proud of it
  (84/84 is perfect) though it can easily be beaten. Anyways, this is
  nothing to serous, just wanted to put something up on the new site.
  
  Also, Ryback, HR ain't no IWAD!

  PS: Zvonimir Bužanic, your upload page says "Only doom2.exe and built
  demos are accepted!" but this is not a doom2.exe demo but a doom.exe
  (715,493 bytes) demo. You might want to clear that up before some
  newcomer get's confused.
  								
  								
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 1:45 by Kyle McAwesome, timestamped:
