Description:  I did 0:39 quite easily, then after next 20 mins i got 
              0:35. Thought that time is bad, but then i watched it
              again and found out how lucky i was (except that annoying
              teleport). I look forward to see a Pacifist demo. 
             
              The route credits go to Chris Ratcliff.
