Description:
Radek wrote   I did 0:39 quite easily, then after next 20 mins i got 
              0:35. Thought that time is bad, but then i watched it
              again and found out how lucky i was (except that annoying
              teleport). I look forward to see a Pacifist demo. 
              The route credits go to Chris Ratcliff.


I like these short runs so when I saw your 35s I just tried to beat that
and after about a halfhour I did 31. I did also something that you take
as a present Radek ... pacifist run in 32 ! 
Iïd also like to praise this map -> credits goto author :P
