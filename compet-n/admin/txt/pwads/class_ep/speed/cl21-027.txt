  Description :

  So, now I remember why I quit this game...been playing for this for three days, including one 7pm to 8am session. (Timestamp on this demo is 2:20am). This run is dedicated to whichever jackass at id sat down in a planning meeting and said "hey, you know what? The shotgun in this game is so great, we should make an ENEMY who has one!"

This isn't optimal, the monsters work out just about perfectly but there's some sloppy running (blue key through to yellow key is messy, and I didn't quite hit the exit switch perfectly). 0:26 is possible, *maybe* 0:25. I got very lucky at the red key after missing a couple of shots, I was getting tired and about to jack it in for the night after this attempt! Shooting the barrels after the blue key leads to a very slight time hit (if executed perfectly, I do it a bit sloppily here and probably lose 0.3s) and massively increases your chance of a clean window jump, so I find it a worthwhile tradeoff (it's best to hit the closest barrel so the farthest one is blown across towards the just-opened monster room before it explodes). The shot-at-nothing in the yellow key area is because there's usually a sergeant in that corner you can kill without time penalty while you wait for the door to open, he must have caught a stray bullet earlier in this run or something. This is one of those frustrating runs where you need a large amount of monster luck: you can get killed or blocked at almost any point in the run, even if you execute perfectly.
