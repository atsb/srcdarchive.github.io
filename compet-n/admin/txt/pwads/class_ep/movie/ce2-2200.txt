CL21 - I usually get around 55 seconds here
CL22 - This is about an average time here
CL23 - sorry, I play this one fairly safe.  It's a difficult one to speed
CL24 - Well, I missed the soulsphere, so I went back to get it, losing
       some time.  At least it makes it easier to get the berzerk
CL25 - ok run I guess.  Could be much faster if I didn't play safe.
CL26 - an ok run.  I got hit by the baron, so I played it safe shooting
       shotgunners by the switch instead of running through.
CL27 - Damn, screwed up the ending bigtime here.
CL28 - Cool! I just ran around shooting pigs and cacodemons and the barons
       took care of Mr. Big without my help.  Maybe that makes it possible
       to do pacifist.

Well as you can see there's lots of :|'s, so it could have been faster.
The primary goal here was to complete this with a halfway decent time,
and I think I've managed that.
