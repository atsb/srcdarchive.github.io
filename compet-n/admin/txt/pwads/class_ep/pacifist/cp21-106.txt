  Description: It seems silly to upload a 1:06 when the max
	       record is 1:29(and the speed record is :29)... 
	       but this is not as easy as it looks.
	       (trying to boost some competition here)  heh

	       Not many pwad demos recently...  I think it is
	       because all the default runs have been done by
	       good players.  If Adam adds, say Darkening2,
	       then I think we see some more.  :)
