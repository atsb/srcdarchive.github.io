  Description: 

  Hmmm, this level really can be difficult sometimes, but
  with practice and a good strategy it's not too bad.
  Laura:  Just because I took your point doesn't mean I want
  you to quit recording.  I thought this could be an
  interesting challenge.  If you want to keep your points
  then I suggest flooding the pwads with tablefillers.
  Just look at the Requiem tables to see what I mean.
