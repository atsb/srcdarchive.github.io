Map description
-------------------
e2m1: class_ep is a small Doom1 style map with what seems like
quite a few shotgun guys. The number of shotgun guys made it kind of 
hard for me to even complete on Tyson, just a couple shots from them 
and you're dead.

-------------------       

Description: I think the first thing that I should say, is, compet-n
is most certainly the realm of the single-player doomgods, and I cannot
say for sure what posessed me to stick my head in here (not unlike
a mouse sticking its head into a cat's den). I've never uploaded one
before, and I can say with absolute certainty that any of the regular 
Compet-N players can beat my time on this map in very short order. 
Nevertheless, I decided to upload it; we'll see if the doom-gods let 
me keep this one compet-n point for a little while.

I want to thank Anders Johnsen just for being such a fierce player; 
Ocelot for being there, and getting so damn good so fast that I have
more hope for the future of Doom than ever; Henning for making his
mind-boggling, incredible Nightmare speedruns for us mortals to watch
and shake our heads at in disbelief, and Waldon for encouraging me to 
make this run in the first place.
