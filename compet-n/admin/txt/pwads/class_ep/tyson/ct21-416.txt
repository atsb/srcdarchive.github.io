Map description
-------------------
e2m1: class_ep is a small Doom1 style map with what seems like
quite a few shotgun guys. The number of shotgun guys made it kind of 
hard for me to even complete on Tyson, just a couple shots from them 
and you're dead.

-------------------       

Description: Well, I originally made a kind of slow demo that was 6:57, I knew that the skilled compet-n players could beat it easily, and said so in the textfile. Then, Waldon told me that a keyboarder had managed to beat my time, and I was like oh, my god? It was that bad? yep. So, I had to do something about that.

Need to thank Adam Hegyi; this demo exists because I studied Adam's tyson technique very closely, and managed to mimic him well enough to complete the map much faster than before. Definately learned a lot. Also Waldon for encouraging me to get the job done.
