  Description: 

  Most of the level is pretty easy, but the real hard part
  here is getting back to the soulsphere area after getting
  the berzerk.  Most of the time a baron comes in and you will
  be able to score a few free punches, but after that you have
  to rush him(attack him continuously without attempting to dodge)
