  Description: 

  Hmmm I think maybe you misunderstood my last txt file.
  I was suggesting that you do lots of pwad demos, cause
  players like Adam Hegyi and Adam Williamson have that nasty
  habit of beating new players demos in just a few hours, but
  if you make lots of them they will get bored of beating your
  demos.  As for the demo, it's ok.  I decided to take the
  invisibility and go all out with the chainsaw until it runs
  out, which I think works pretty well.  I had some health
  problems near the end so I played quite cautiously, so
  you should be able to beat this.

  P.S.  Next time try studing the style of Henning Skogsto
  instead, and you might have more success.
