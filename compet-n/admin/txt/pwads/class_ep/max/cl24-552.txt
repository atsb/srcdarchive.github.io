  Description: Good idea to use berserk on those Barons, Xit,
               it's possible to make some good time savings there.
               It can also get quite hectic though, so I just
               saved up rockets.

               As the ending shows, under 5:30 should be very easy.
               I lost at least 25 seconds just waiting for the faulty
               monster teleporter to start working :) What I think
               happened is the first monster didn't activate the
               teleport line, like the player sometimes does in Map27.
               Then because he was stuck in the small teleporter
               sector none of the other monsters could get close
               enough to the teleport line to activate it. A longer
               teleport sector with room for more than one monster
               would probably prevent this.
