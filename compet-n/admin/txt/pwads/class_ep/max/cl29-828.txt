Description             : 

I recorded this one for Doug. It's about time this one gets an initial
entry also. Doug told me he is attempting a complete episode movie run
but is having troubles with this map. So I whipped up this demo to show
him how I deal with the map. I reckon this map should be easier in an
episode run if you can carry over some rocket or cell ammo. 

1st successful run through with 4 attempts taken. 

Running quality is poor - I have been away from DOOM playing for at least
a month. Aim wise I think I did alright considering the time that has
passed since I played seriously.
