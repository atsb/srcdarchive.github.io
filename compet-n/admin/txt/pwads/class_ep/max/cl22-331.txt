Description             : 46 seconds faster then Doug's initial entry.

Besides a little faster running I think I just use better route choices.
I did this time on the first successful run through. However, since I
designed this map I have sufficient knowledge of what to do where. :-)

Arno originally did a very good 2:30 of classic5. Since then I've bumped
up the enemies on UV from 79 to 100. So I would guess a near optimal 
time would be around 3 minutes.

BTW Doug - great DM map (probably best of the ep). I've played it DM
a couple times.
