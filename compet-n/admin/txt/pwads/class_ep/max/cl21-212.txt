Description             : 100% kills and 100% secrets on Ultra Violence.

Just a starter run by me in my own map. I got this after a couple tries.
It also shows how I thought (or designed) the map to be played. I guess
optimal time (or very good atleast) would be around 1:40. Hopefully this
submission will encourage people to make demos for this and other maps
of the Classic Episode and also to encourage people to write descriptions
in their textfiles (heh heh). You know, what you like/didn't like about 
the map [hint hint].

I would write what I did/didn't like but it's my own map. So I am forced
to like/hate everything about it. hehe
