Description             : Watching Doug's demo I was like:

"What da hell is he doing ?? :D Too much wine on New Years for Doug!"

Doug's demo actually had 99% kills as he missed one imp at the end.

4 minutes and 17 seconds faster. This was my first successful run 
through. Although compiling this episode and doing a few edits to
the level and I know it like the back of my hand. 

Really this level is about micro-management of health and ammo. In
my opinion there is enough of each. Except, it's not always where
you need it when you need it. Picking up the beserk at the right
time is essential if your having health problems. 

Nick really did a great job of redoing the final area. I fine tuned
the battle area (for instance - originally Nick only had two ends 
open for battle until I had the north wall lower). A great ending
to the Classic Episode.
