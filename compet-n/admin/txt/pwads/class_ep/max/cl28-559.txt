  Description :-)

  Fish's run here was too casual again, so I made a few improvements.
  First of all I used fist in a few places, and also I lose less time
  shooting the hogs in the slime.  I like the way Fish managed the
  cyber scene though.  Checked with timer.exe to show that no monsters
  were alive, as well as to get the time.  Damn that's a nice program,
  thanks Adam.
