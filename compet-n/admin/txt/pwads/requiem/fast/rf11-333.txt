  Requiem – Map 11 – UV Fast

Managed to get this in about ten minutes. I remember once having a session where I tried to complete the level in -fast for 2-3 hours, and yet I always died. Things went surprisingly well in this demo, which is kind of strange considering how much of a pain stuff like this can be at time. Managed to shave off 2 minutes and 16 seconds for this run.
