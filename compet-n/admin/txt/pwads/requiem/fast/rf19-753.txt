Finally got this one finished. The SSG usage on the mancubi is great. Usually, I got 4 shots on the each one, but on most of them here, I got 3. This thankfully saves some SSG ammo for the later areas. In the plasma gun area, I'd try to use a trick where I wouldn't get the platform to descend. However, I decided not to do that for a better chance of success. The last area, was kind of luck-based. I had to make sure the Pain Elementals and their lost souls didn't take away a huge portion of my health. After that, everything was simple.
