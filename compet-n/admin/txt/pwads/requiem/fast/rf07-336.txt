Demo entry #4.

Description:

Good cooperation, Jens Nielsen and Matthias Worch! A well-designed romantic
level, exciting to speed with -fast.

Just like my previous three demos, nothing too skillful. But it uses a quick,
daring, very deadly route. I only wanted something below 4:00, and 3:36 simply
amazed me. However, this ancient run has quite a few slow lame movements in the
second half, and the end went sloppily, so 3:2X or less is very possible.
