  Description :-)
  
  I like this map.  I played this one at a fast pace
  and almost died as a result, but this only improves my
  time.  I can see some improvement, for example I wasted
  rockets trying to kill the demon, where I could have
  used it against the mancubus.  I think it is a kind of
  screwed up name for a map though.  It's nice that you
  don't have to worry too much about getting 100%kills
  like you do on map03 or map06.
