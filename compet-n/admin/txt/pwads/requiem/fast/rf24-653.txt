Description:

I think I gave up UV -fast category after Tatsurd released his pack for
Epic 2. He kind of reinvented the category with his brilliant demos. Now
UV -fast time "should" be around UV Max time, no matter how difficult the
map is.

However, somehow I returned to this map, just improving my super cautious
run from 2010 and not getting even close to UV Max record. I used
practically all the ammo, so OK. I can't kill barons on my first run to
the RK due to lost souls (when I come back there are fewer of them, better
placed). With my strategy and skill 6:53 is not a bad time.

Old records:

9:44 by me
