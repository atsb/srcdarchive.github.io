Another table-filler. The yellow key part is hard without losing a lot of health, so I had to use the NM route where I get the blue and red keys first and then the yellow key, because I have a soul sphere. After that can be pretty hard, because there's no armor after the megaarmor and there's a bunch of imps
and gunners that can screw around.
