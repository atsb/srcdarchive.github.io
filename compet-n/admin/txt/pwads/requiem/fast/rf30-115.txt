  Description :)
  Wow! Didn't even die at the end! This was extremely hard and I didn't
  appreciate Xit's crappy demo until I tried it myself. Just exiting with
  all pre-respawned monsters dead is an achievement. Getting this record
  was harder than getting my F4M1-226. This level is by all means harder
  than E4M1, and it will make you appreciate health bonus more than ever
  before. This was just outstanding. Killing both cacos at the end looks
  deceptively easy, but it is the hardest part of the whole thing. Dying
  at the end is almost inevitable if you take the time out to destroy
  both of those bulbus creatures. You most be always moving, standing
  still for even a fraction of a second will result in death, but at the
  same time, you must avoid getting telefragged.

  Ahh, I dare anyone to challenge this. While I have no doubts the time is
  improvable, you will be met with quite a challenge. It will not be easy.

  Props to Adam Windsor for making such a challenging level, definitely one
  of my favorite Icon of Sin maps, and defeating the Icon of Sin isn't even
  the hard part.
