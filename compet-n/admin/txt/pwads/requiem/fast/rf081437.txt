  Description : Man, this map has some serious ammo problems. Nothing is easier here then to                 run out of amunition. Well maybe except dying.:) The music here is one of my                 favorites so I wanted to have something in this map. I did two things that                  anger me(the berserk Revenant was not activated as planned; I thought I                     activated the lift to the "second floor switch" area but didn't) but looking                 at the demo as a whole, I think it's good.
