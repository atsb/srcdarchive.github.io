| A demo you'll soon forget about - it's so unspectacular. I got tired   |
| of too challenging challenges and noticed this record was rather slow  |
| compared to UV Max. Now I know why :) It may have something to do with |
| being a 2001 demo by Xit, but more with how this map plays. You may    |
| successfully use berserk agains hordes of spectres or against cacos    |
| under normal circumstances, but with -fast monsters it's asking for    |
| trouble, if lack of health was not troublesome enough for you.         |
|                                                                        |
| PS  Unfortunately, the "one out of nine imps not teleporting" problem, |
| plaguing Max demos, happens sometimes with -fast monsters, too...      |
| I had 8:35 with 99% kills.                                             |
