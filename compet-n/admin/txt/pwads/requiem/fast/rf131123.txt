  Description :-)
  
  This is a fun level.  It isn't terribly difficult, but hardly
  any -fast demos are too hard.  There are a lot of traps though.
  A few times I have forgotten about a revenant and had it whack
  me a few times with fireballs.  Maybe I should go after Adam's
  maxkill run, as there are a few flaws in it.
