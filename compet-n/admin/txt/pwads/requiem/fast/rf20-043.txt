  Description :)
  I was looking at Kyle McAwesome's DSDA page and to my surprise, noticed he
  had a few COMPET-N records. I watched them and then decided to take down
  his RF20-046.
  
  I thought it would be easy but... well he put it best so:
   "This level is much harder than one would expect on -fast."
    ~ Kyle McAwesome, most logical quote found on the internet since 1995.
    (I'm board)
  
  But anyways, under 40 seconds is possible but you'd have to rely on the
  Lost Souls killing the imps and or Spectres and those Lost Souls are not
  ones to rely on when in need, so I think this record will last a bit.
  								
  								
  By the way, COMPET-N record was 0:46 by Kyle McAwesome, timestamped:
