| "Revenant missiles always do 80 HP damage. And I mean *always*" - Maes |
|                                                                        |
| As I said, I like this map. It gets 5/5 from me for gameplay (I'd say  |
| it is a semi-reality map; when you play it, you know why) and 4.5/5    |
| for architecture (so low because the room with the baron and crusher   |
| has incredibly ugly textures. The rest is fantastic). Why this map has |
| so few demos? I don't know.                                            |
|                                                                        |
| After three 11:xx exits I got this one and I don't know what to say.   |
| Perhaps it can be done 1-2 minutes faster by Hitherto for example.     |
| My first mistake was not to use RL at 2:29. Second mistake - I missed  |
| a revenant at 5:15. At 5:39 the revenant reminded me of its existence  |
| hitting my left side - 80% damage of course :) You can imagine my      |
| surprise :) BUT - there's a room with 3 PEs and a mancubus. Normally   |
| I spend ages there dealing with lost souls. This time everything went  |
| perfectly in this room. I'm also glad the last baron died in a very    |
| convenient moment. Half a second later and I would have run out of     |
| cells and I would have been surrounded by lost souls. Thus, on the     |
| whole, not the worst table-filler I believe.                           |
|                                                                        |
