  Requiem – Map 28 – UV Fast

How come hardly anybody makes any -fast demos for this WAD anymore? This level has only 89 monsters, so it wasn't really that hard. I thought I was a bit pressed for ammo so I used my weapons sparingly. It was a bit hard trying to survive without armor until the end. I decided to get some goodies at the end because anything could happen.
