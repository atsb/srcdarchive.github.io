  Description :-)
  
  A large map with a few hard parts, but with a little
  practice you should be able to do it in only a few
  tries.  The final bridge part can be hard, but with
  my method it is not very difficult.  There is plenty
  of ammo on this stage, so you don't have to worry
  about conserving it.
