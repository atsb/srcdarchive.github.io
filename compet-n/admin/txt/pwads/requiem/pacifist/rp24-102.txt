  Description :-)
  
  Today for the first time I managed a symmetrical
  bars glide. I found that it was quite repeatable,
  and after bringing the nomonsters time down to 28
  I was ready to make a pacifist demo. Now that I ran
  out of pacifist to do in TNT(I consider ep08 to be
  impossible now), I am looking at the pwads for some
  interesting challenges.
