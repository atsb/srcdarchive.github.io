  Description :-)
  
  Not bad.  I thought this one would be really hard, but it
  was manageable.  After getting the yellow key there isn't
  much to worry about.  I also decided to take all the secrets
  here.  The armor is a no-brainer, and the other one is the
  backpack which may take a couple of shots but it's well worth
  it to make this a 100% secrets demo.  The part with the
  chaingunners is of course the hardest part, since there are
  pigs respawning all over the place.
