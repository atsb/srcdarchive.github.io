  Description :-)
  
  I had generally assumed that this one would be impossible
  to do based on the difficulty in UV, but I started playing
  and found it to be quite possible. It isn't even that hard.
  In retrospect, I probably should have skipped the bfg room
  since the secret is at the beginning and you don't have to
  teleport to get it. I died once trying to do the arch-vile
  jump from there because I got stuck by an imp. This time
  I didn't want to deal with the baron of hell so I chose
  to go into the pit instead.
