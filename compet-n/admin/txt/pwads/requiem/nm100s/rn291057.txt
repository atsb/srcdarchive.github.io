  Description :-)
  
  Well, this is the second to last map in Requiem to be done
  in nightmare. The last one, rn14, should be extremely difficult
  if not impossible for normal play. Anyways, this one was a good
  challenge, although things get quite a bit easier after taking
  the yellow key. In fact this is the 4'th time I got the yellow
  key. The first time the archvile and mancubus killed me (at the
  very end). The second time I got killed by the revenant by the
  switch (the one with a shotgunner and a pain elemental), and the
  third time I died after I got back to the blue door. After that
  first time with the yellow key I knew that I had to practice the
  ending, and came up with this method of killing the arch-vile
  before opening the red door. The most frustrating part of this
  demo is the blue key. 192 unit gaps always seem to be a bit of
  a crapshoot. Also cacos after the blue door are quite annoying
  as they can appear out of nowhere and shoot fireballs down at
  you.
