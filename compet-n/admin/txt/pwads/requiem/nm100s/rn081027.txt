  Description :-)
  
  This didn't take so long--only an afternoon. I think this
  is a map that I should have done already, but never got
  around to doing it. There's a couple of parts where I had
  low health. Once by the pigs I was down to 1%. Around there
  could be the hardest part of the map. Also, I was careless
  and got hit by the revenant, but fortunately there was a
  berzerk right there. There are 2 tricks in this demo: the
  first is a jump after getting ther berzerk which cuts out
  a decent part of the map. The second is a switch trick near
  the end which probably doesn't make much difference. It's
  also 100% secrets.
