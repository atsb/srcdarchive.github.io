  Description :-)
  
  This was pretty cool to make considering I did the TAS
  demo for this one and considered it to be impossible.
  After watching the TAS demo I can see why I thought it
  impossible. It's a fairly difficult demo, and very
  intense. I think it feels easier than rp04, although
  I probably spent about the same amount of time on it.
  Reaching the first teleport after the yellow key is
  not difficult, and after that is where things get
  tough. After hitting the switch to raise the stairs,
  it is difficult to kill the hell knight or pass him
  safely because a caco or chainer can come in and cause
  trouble. After that it's difficult to deal with the
  baron of hell while pigs and imps respawn, and the
  occasional caco may wander in as well. After that
  things get simpler. It's important to manage ammo
  because there are places you can run out such as the
  pigs before the blue key. It turns out that there are
  only 3 secrets so this is a nightmare secrets demo.
  It's also the nightmare speed record of course.
