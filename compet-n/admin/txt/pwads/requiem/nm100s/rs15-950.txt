  Description :-)
  
  Well, I probably should have done this nightmare secrets
  demo in the first place instead of doing the secret exit run
  first. It turns out the armor secret is quite easy to get and
  even helps get past the blue key and gunner areas. In this
  demo I thought I would try to get all the secrets and then
  proceed to the normal exit. Instead what happened is when
  I did the archie jump first I went to the teleporter, got
  lost a bit and then got hit again, so I decided that it was
  best to simply take the secret exit. Also, at the red key
  area I got stuck so I went around and killed the pain
  elementals before dealing with the baron. This seems to work
  better than just making a run for it. Oh, and the pigs didn't
  come in at the end, so that was fortunate.
