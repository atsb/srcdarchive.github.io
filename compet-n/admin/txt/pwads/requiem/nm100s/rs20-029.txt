Description:

32 second improvement over Vono's in only about 30 minutes.

Not hard at all, just grab the backpack secret, rush to the Yellow
Key, grab the other secret, teleport to the rocket launcher, run to
the Yellow Door, open it, then hide and wait for the Baron and Knight
to come out and then run to the exit.

Had a :31 here (before going back to see if I could improve it a bit)
where after grabbing the Yellow Key, I opened the Yellow door and then
back to the other secret, THEN back to the exit...it gave the
Baron/Knight time to leave that hallway to the exit.

My theory though was that this route would be faster than that route.
In a sense, it is, but either way you have to wait...so who knows. As
a bonus I attached the :31 in this as well, so you could see it.

Um...optimal is probably around the :25 or :24 mark here, at least
that's my guess ^_^
