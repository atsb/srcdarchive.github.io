  Description :-)
  
  This wasn't so hard.  Of course there were many times when
  I was annoyed by monster respawns.  Like any Iikka map it
  has cramped parts which can be handled, but when a monster
  respawns where it's supposed to be clear there can be
  problems.  There can also be ammo problems.  100% secrets
  as well.
