  Description:
 
  Awesome! I tried this months ago but ruled it out as too hard
  But now I had more will to try this.
  I kept getting constantly low 12s and got many good runs
  dying at the final area with zombies.

  This run went all good. Near the ending with all the zombies
  I glanced at my health and noticed I had 22 health, I knew I
  had very low chance of survival but I tried to run it well         anyway in case I survive Damn.. when exiting and getting 11
  it felt pretty epic there... I think this run is awesome.
