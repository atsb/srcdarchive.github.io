  Description :-)
  
  This isn't typical of my more fun nightmare demos.  I had
  to do a lot of picking off shotgunners/chainers by
  strategically finding the best space to only be attacked
  by one of them at a time.  Obviously it would be possible
  to do it much more quickly, but that would involve taking
  lots of risks.  I prefer the kind where you have to take
  on lots of monsters in big rooms with lots of health, for
  example, Requiem level 31.
