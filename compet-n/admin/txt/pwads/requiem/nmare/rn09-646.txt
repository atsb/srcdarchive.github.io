  Description :-)
  
  Whoa, this took quite a few tries to do this, until I
  discovered the new trick.  I tried with my UVspeed route,
  but this is much much safer.  I let the switch come down,
  then I grab the key by running into it.  That way it
  doesn't release the demons.  Surprisingly, this was the
  first attempt after discovering that trick.
