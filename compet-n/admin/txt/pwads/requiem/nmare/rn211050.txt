  Description :-)
  
  Way too much plasma when playing this on nightmare, but
  that's ok with me, because I was able to use most of it
  effectively.  I think now the fight at the waterfalls was
  done pretty stupidly.  Rockets would have been better.
  This is also 88% secrets, which I believe is the maximum
  possible.
