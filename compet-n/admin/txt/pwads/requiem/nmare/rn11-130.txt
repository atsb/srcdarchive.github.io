  Description :-)
  
  Getting to the exit area is pretty easy, but then
  the difficult part is to get the red key and get
  back.  I use a trick where a monster keeps the
  bars open while I run under them.  It's not the
  first time the trick has done, but I think this
  is the first time it's been used in a compet-n demo.
  I found the most reliable method is to leave the
  imp by the switch alive and lure the revenant under
  the bars.  With this method I was able to do this
  without too many tries.  Earlier I had tried this
  but given up.  I've also tried on the long route
  but I think that is very difficult and requires
  a lot of luck.  In UV I don't think it would
  work as well to use a revenant because he would
  probably move between shots, so there you would
  want to use a chainer or imp.
