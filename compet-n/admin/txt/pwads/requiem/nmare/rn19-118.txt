  Description:

  My 4th Compet-N Entry..
   
  I used my UV route also for Nightmare run. Only differences are that
  I killed first spiders more safely and then I made jump to avoid
  activating trigger opening place with two mancubuses early. Chaingunners
  at the end are sometimes very annoying. Sometimes they kill me in one
  second even if I have 150 health I can see only nice red sreen, but now
  it went pretty good. I had 1:25 four times and then this and I'm 
  satisfied because my dead-line was 1:20. This is of course very 
  improvable to 1:10.
