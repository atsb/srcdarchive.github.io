  Description :-)
  
  This is one of the maps in Requiem that I did a TAS for and
  knew that it should be possible normally.  It starts out easy
  but gets progressively harder, up until the very end.  Until
  the blue door is not so hard.  I use some careful playing to
  conserve health and stay alive.  It doesn't really get hard
  until the outside area near the red key.  I found that it is
  possible to get the red key and back without first getting
  the soulsphere.  This helps a lot because there are lots of
  stimpacks which would otherwise be wasted.  Then I go to the
  other side to get the backpack and blue armor.  Once I ran out
  of ammo at the cacos before I started taking the backpack.
  The cacos required some practice but I found them not to
  be too hard with the extra 150 health in the yellow door
  secret.  I needed 6 tries for the cacos to reach the red door.
  Then I thought the final bridge would be relatively easy, but
  I found the chainers can really do lots of damage, and it's
  hard to take care of them with so many imp fireballs around.
  I needed 3 tries on the bridge, and in this one I barely made
  it.
