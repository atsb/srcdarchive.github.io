Description:
            Well what have we here. I finally got through map07 with 100% kills.:) I wanted             to do this later this year but I couldn't get it out of my mind after the                   Memento Mori movie so here it is. While I enjoyed doing the mm movie, here,                 after 5 maps I got nervous and couldn't concentrate fully on the run. That's                typical for me. The mm run was easier than this but maybe only because I know               the mm ep.1 maps better. Oh and PLEASE someone do a Alien Vendetta max movie or             some other max movie so I can just sit and enjoy it and not criticize the whole             time how I screwed up that and that... :)))

01: I don't like this map mainly because the tyson start. Below 1min. is acceptable for me.

02: A good map.

03: Finally this is one of the few lucky runs where the last blue door imp teleports in when     I still can kill him without a major time loss or 99% kills at end.

04: The standart "get the SSG" map. :) Never try to fire a weapon that is out of ammunition     especially when facing two Chaingunners!!! If this was -fast i wouldn't be writing this.     Not awaking the last Cacodemons on first crossing the bridge really helped. 

05: Got a bit confused sometimes as I forgot the route a few times. Used the -fast technique     which is safe but slow in the 2PE 2HK room mainly because I died quite a few times here.     It relly isn't the same while practicing and then going live.

06: When aproaching the blue key and bumped the Baron I thought I'm dead. Then in the trap      room I tried not to hit the "un-trap" switch because when you hit it without all imps       teleported in it's "Q" -you can't get 100% kills when that hapens. Then a Caco almost       survived, luckilly he made me know that he's there. A very good map.

07: The "one Arachnotron not teleporting in" bug didn't happen once since I release them        without being by the yellow key. Coincidence? Maybe, maybe not who knows. Lost some time     by healing but I wanted to start map08 healthy should something go wrong.

08: Best music in ep.1 imo. Behold the Killer imp killing a Cacodemon with only one             fireball (previous SSG involvement doesn't count in :)). Great map.
 
09: Behold the Return of the Killer imp!! Poor Mancubus. Except this nothing unusual happed     here but I was forced to "q" a few times in the past when only one Cacodemon teleported     in by the red key.

10: This movie just would't be complete without a rocket in the face now would it.:)
