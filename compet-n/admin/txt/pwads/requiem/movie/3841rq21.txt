Wow, it went way better than I expected:

MAP21 - equals my personal best, so I have to record YET another UV Speed which would be faster
        than the movie one...
MAP22 - the switch trick, I made it, unbelievable, I can make it 10% of the time. It is also
        faster than UV Max record, which is not so common (!)
MAP23 - OK, call it lame, but even with this style of play I die on this map more than on the
        others combined.
MAP24 - Clear work, 195% health and a soulsphere, hehe.
MAP25 - No problems here.
MAP26 - A minor hickup, but I had enough health.
MAP27 - The UV Speed route is a bit longer as Oyvind and Xit need some weapons. This shortcut
        near the blue armor amazes me, was it really intentional?
MAP28 - Cautiously, gets the job done. I had plenty of rockets.
MAP29 - The jump on the first try. AMAZING. Then I go for some useless kills as I hate these
        inifinitely tall cacos, so I want them to go near the revenants.
MAP30 - Yep, of course, an arch-vile. Can you screw the whole run up, vdgg? Oh, what a relief.
