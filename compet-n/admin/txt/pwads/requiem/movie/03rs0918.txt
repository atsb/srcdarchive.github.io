  Description :-)
  
  level 1: This map is an easy one.  Just try to exit with
           as much health as possible.  I'm glad I thought
           of a good method to kill the imps/shotgunners
           without taking much damage.  I also took an
           extra box of bullets to have more for map03.
  
  Level 2: This map is also easy.  I played slow to keep
           as much health as possible for map03.

  Level 3: I'm surprised this one caused me as few
           problems as it did.  I had to try several times
           to get my rn03-719, but this only took 3 tries,
           and it doesn't help much to start the level
           with armor and weapons.  There are a few
           rough spots in this demo, but I survived.

  Continuing on to finish level 4 would probably be
  very difficult, so I didn't even attempt it.  I could
  have saved a little time on map01 and map02 by not
  getting the secrets, but since it doesn't make it
  any harder, I decided to make the whole thing nm100%s.
