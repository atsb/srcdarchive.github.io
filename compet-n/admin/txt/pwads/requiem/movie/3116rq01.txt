  Description :-)
  
  level 1: I pick up the bullets and the armor, so 17 is
           a nice time for me.  I could probably get 16 on
           this route if I focused on that.
  
  Level 2: Not a bad time.  Theres a couple of screwups here

  Level 3: A bit slow

  Level 4: also fairly slow, but I'm happy because both
           tricks worked here.  I used the old method of
           killing all the monsters at the beginning
           because I wanted the backpack.

  Level 5: Not bad.  I was able to pass the cacos quickly.

  Level 6: Cool that I got this on speedrun route.

  Level 7: A cautious run, but I was able to get the keygrab
           on the first try

  Level 8: Fairly slow I think.  The switch trick didn't work
           well here.

  Level 9: Very sloppy run.

  Level 10: Hmmm, not so bad, but I was hoping for a better
            time.  Well, at least it's a short run so it
            doesn't make much difference.

  Well I thought my old run was out of date, so I improevd it.
  Most of the time I'm just shooting everything in the way, but
  I did take some risks here.
