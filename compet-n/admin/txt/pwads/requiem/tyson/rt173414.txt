| First of all, Jeremy Doyle's music. It's great. It converted a         |
| "random set of corridors and rooms" into an intriguing adventure-like  |
| level. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad map, that curved bridge is   |
| one of those memorable places in Requiem, but still... MM2 MAP17, also |
| by Michael Rapp, is better IMO. BTW, Revved, what's up with that MM    |
| MAP19 Tyson? :-P                                                       |
|                                                                        |
| What's difficult here? I'd say there is little health for such a big   |
| Tyson map. I try to postpone picking up the blue armor as much as      |
| possible, preferably when the green armor is almost gone. The time     |
| was better than I expected, but I had luck with one stuck arachno.     |
| Pretty slow and safe overall. Boring (?) But hey, next on my list are  |
| MM MAP05 and MM2 MAP29, if I ever succeed, they HAVE to be interesting |
| to watch!                                                              |
