  Description :-)
  
  This turned out to be a little easier than I expected.
  I didn't use a couple boxes of bullets, and I could
  probably have killed the last mancubus with fists but
  since I had bullets I played it safe and shot him.
  I would say this is definitely easier than t4m6 but it
  certainly less boring.
