  Description :-)
  
  With 12 cacodemons and only 270 bullets(available at the start)
  this is a challenge.  There are a few ways to do this, but I 
  think mine is the most reliable.  I hide at the start and saw
  a few cacodemons, then go back and shoot the rest.  I had lots
  of bullets leftover, since more than 5 decided to visit me in
  the starting room.  It is important not to release the arch-viles
  and pigs all at once.  If you can fight the archies without
  other monsters in the way, then they are easy to chainsaw.
