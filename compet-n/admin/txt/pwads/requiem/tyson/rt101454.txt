  Description :-)
  
  Fish told me a while ago that he was trying this, and I
  told him it was a bad choice for a new tyson player.
  At the time I didn't know it was possible normally but
  from my experiences with my new t2m8 and t3m9 I realized
  that there are ways to punch cybers even in tricky 
  situations.  I was quite fortunate with the cyber
  getting stuck in the corner on my first invuln so
  I only needed 12 or so non-invuln punches, which is easy
  for me.  I would like to say good job on the tysons Fish
  has done so far for the memento mori wads as well as a
  couple of av ones too.
