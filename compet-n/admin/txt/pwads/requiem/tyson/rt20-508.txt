recorded with Doom2.exe v1.9

Description: Now this is an improvement.  Didn't even use the medkit in
that secret area.  I'm not so sure what caused the time improvement as
my plan to distract the Hell Knight or Baron after it hit an imp so the
imp could do more damage didn't work.  If one could somehow telefrag
either of the big enemies and not take much time in doing it, there's
still room for a lage improvement.  Pistol shooting the Baron of Hell
took a long time in this demo.
Heh, by the time Adam H updates, I'll probably already be retired from
Doom2.  This will likely be my last Compet-N entry.  Requiem maps 03
and 26 are very likely both possible in Tyson but I don't have the time
to produce successful recordings of them.
