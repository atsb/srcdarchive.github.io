| This one required a lot of patience. If I'm not mistaken I reached     |
| the blue key area 12 times and the final room with sergeants (cruel!)  |
| 5 times. I had one exit earlier in 35:08, but forgot about killing     |
| four imps. In short, you may find the ending lame or too cautious, but |
| I wanted to have this done at all costs and didn't care about the      |
| style and time (33-34 minutes would be fine). Attaching a strange demo |
| - a failed attempt with an all-ghosts bug after 15 minutes, viewable   |
| in doom2.exe, out of sync in PrBoom.                                   |
