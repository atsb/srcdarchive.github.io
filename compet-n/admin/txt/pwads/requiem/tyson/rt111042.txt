| After watching Xit Vono's demo I thought it would be easy. I was       |
| wrong. When you're low on health, a caco will always release a         |
| fireball ("you're chainsawing me dude? pain chance, you say? so        |
| what?!"), or a chaingunner will pop up out of nowhere. Then I got      |
| 11:43 and almost immediately after that, 10:42. I consider it a lucky  |
| run, many chaingunners helped killing bigger baddies, so I believe     |
| this record will stay for long.                                        |
