Description: An example of a demo gone horribly wrong.  With 70 bullets
, limited health, and no chainsaw or berserk, one might think this
would a hard Tyson but it's actually easy.  Strange how this map is
easier to do Tyson in UV rather than a lower difficulty.  If you even
get hurt by the demons, you've done something wrong.  The only
difficulty is punching out the Pain Elemental.  Staying close to it so
it can't produce lost souls is the key but that went badly here.
Somehow I survive.  I almost lose it at the red key too.  I knew I was
going slow the instant I jumped for the key and was afriad i'd get
surrounded and die but I manage to escape the imps with 7% health.  I
thought the time would be worse but I guess I was fairly successful
with the demons.  Anyways, I think the end result is funny.
