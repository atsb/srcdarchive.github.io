Description:

Finally!

First, the guillotine hall. There is a mancubus and 8 revenants there.
If taken one by one, a mancubus can kill 4 revs, I think I had 5 only
once. You can punch the remaining ones, also one by one, but it's slow
and tedious. You can leave some alive, they tend to occupy that hall.
On the other hand, you want SOME of these revenants killed. You lure
three more (after blue key door) and two more (near yeallow doors).
The more of them alive, the more likely they will find their way out
and sneak behind you.

Some revs are needed to help with the barons, and two revenants should
be enough, but I kept alive some more. The archies are easy once
I took care no corpses were nearby. I always have problems with the
prison hell knight, though.

Took me > 300 attempts, about 6-7 times I got the berserk.
