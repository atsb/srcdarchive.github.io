  Description :-)

  Those jumps across the poison are nice, I didn't think it was
  possible to get over.
  However, I think I have an improvement for the red key room.
  This keygrab that I found some time ago seems to be slightly
  quicker than running below the wall and waiting for the raising
  walkway. Seems it takes some luck to do the grab on first try,
  though.

  (Update: Seems Xit Vono also discovered the grab, according to
  his Nightmare entry. He used another technique for UV speed though,
  which I think looks slower)
