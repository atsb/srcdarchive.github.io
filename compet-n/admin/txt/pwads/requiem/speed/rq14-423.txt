  Description :-)
  
  This is a very tough map for speedrunning.  The problem is
  it's very easy to die while picking up the rocket launcher.
  I played a pretty safe route here by killing most of the
  monsters in the various corridors.  I also discovered a
  trick where you don't have to wait for the lift to get back
  on the bridge.
