  Description :-)
  
  First of all, credits go to Xit Vono for discovering
  the keygrab featured in this demo. I was just asked
  to record a speedrun with it, and here it is.
  
  It's quite a hard level to speedrun, for the trick
  only saves you a small portion of the level, and there
  is no armor either. I tried to speed up the first
  part as much as I could, it seems to make things easier.
  
  There is still improvement left but I don't think under
  a minute is possible unless someone comes up with
  another trick.
