  Description:

  One second isn't much of an improvement here, but I thought I'd
  start the opening volley. 8-)

  Things got weird around the archie. I miss the gap and end up being
  archie-jumped where I want to be.

  Thanks to Xit for his route. The order of keys definitely should keep
  the same, although the order of buttons to push at the end isn't
  as definite. Xit starts by releasing the renevants, but I find myself
  routinely getting creamed in the attempt, so I take a safer order:
  release the chaingunners and kill them, then do mancubi, pain
  elementals, and finally the renevants. Pausing to kill the
  chain gunners loses quite a bit of time, though. Possibly ideal
  would be first mancubi, then pain elementals, then renevants,
  and finally chain gunners. Much experimentation still to be done.
