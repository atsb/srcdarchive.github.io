  Description:
  Found a relatively good way to get rid of the Hellknights, not shooting the chainer and
  letting him distract them. Doesn't work too well in this run though.
  Made this into a pacifist run and it worked out nicely except for the last 2 revenants 
  which killed me about 10 times before I finally got an exit.
