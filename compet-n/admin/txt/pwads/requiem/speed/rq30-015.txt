  Description:
 
  First I tried to get 16 on the older rl route
  I got 16 after a while which I think is nice demo
  Then I suddenly remembered that the plasmagun damages
  the icon in this map too...
  Not getting rl maybe saves around 3 secs but you can only
  'target' the icon with plasmagun when the red thing is
  fully opened and that could waste about 2 secs, so in
  the end the plasmagun route is about 1 second faster
  
  With the plasmagun route. The damage on the icon greatly
  varies. I of course got many 16s with the plasmagun
  route. What was frustrating me the most was if I give up
  Would I post the 16s rl demo or a 16s plasma demo.
  The lowest 16 I checked is 16.23, then when I thought I
  had 15, it tuned out to be another 16.23 >_<
  
  At this point I decided to use little sr50 in the run. Not that
  it'll be of much use but I guessed that I'll need perfection to
  get 15s or close to it

  Shortly after I started to use sr50, I got this run I was very
  'surprised' how fast the icon died and thought that it could
  be 15 regardless of the flaws I did. Turned out to be 15s heh
  I waited too much at the first door and I got stucked 2 times
  with zombiemen =|
  
  Oh yeah, the intermission is long, I was just pissed off at the    map :P This run doesn't deserve 15, I had lots of good looking
  runs just not lucky enough =/
