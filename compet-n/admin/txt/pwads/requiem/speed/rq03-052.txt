  Description :-)
  
  Congratulations on an ingenious new route. As I wanted to
  try this trick I thought I would try the UV record. This
  was a difficult record as it is requires luck to pass many
  of the monsters without delay. I also tried pacifist here,
  which is very tough but should be possible.
