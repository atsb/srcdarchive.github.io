  Description :-)
  
  I think this is a pretty good time on this map.  Maybe more
  time could be saved by skipping the berzerk, but then you'd
  need some good skills to pass the monsters in the rest of
  the level.  I was fairly lucky that I only needed to punch
  one imp at the teleporter.  If you want to beat this you
  will probably need to be lucky there too.
