  Description :-)
  
  This is probably crap.  It's the first successful attempt, and
  it's difficult to survive this.  The main problem is avoiding
  getting scratched while navigating the narrow passages around
  the castle.  I know it's not necessary to go in with those
  barons to flip the switch, but I wasn't going to risk it that
  far into the demo.
