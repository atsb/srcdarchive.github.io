  Description :-)
  
  Since I discovered that new trick for my TAS movie it was
  obvious that I should try it for Compet-n.  I did improve it
  but there are still sloppy looking parts so it's far from
  optimal.  As for the trick itself, it's fairly difficult,
  but not as hard as a lot of other tricks.
