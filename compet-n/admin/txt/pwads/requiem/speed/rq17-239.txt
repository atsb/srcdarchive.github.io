  Description :-)
  
  It's a good speedrunning map except for a few things.  The first
  problem is the SSG grab is annoying.  The second is that the
  baron blocks the way up after getting the red key.  The third
  annoying thing about this run is that it's easy to lose too much
  health at the yellow key, but that just makes it more challenging
  so I won't complain any more.
