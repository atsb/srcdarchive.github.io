  Description :-)

  I just wanted to show that this level can be done without
  waiting for the exit bars. Although I use strafe50 here it
  can also be done without it.
  This is just my first successful run (the first part of the
  map is filled with monsters and you can only get the shotgun,
  which makes speeding this level somewhat frustrating,I think).
  It should be easily beatable.
