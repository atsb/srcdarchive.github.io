  Description :-)
  
  The first time I tried this I got a 5:12, and decided that must
  be crap because it is just barely faster than max.  Then I tried
  it again and got this.  It seems that this is fairly close to
  optimum.  By that I don't mean you couldn't improve it more than
  a few seconds, but that the run will never be much faster than max.
