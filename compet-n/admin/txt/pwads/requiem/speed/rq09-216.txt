  Description :-)
  
  There's now a trick with the yellow key.  There are two ways
  to get the key without lowering the bars.  The first way is
  to slowly creep up to the key in a way so you don't actually
  cross the linedef that closes the door.  The other way is to
  use strafe 50 through it so it doesn't get activated because
  you are going too fast.  That means now that there are no
  less than 3 tricks used in this demo.  I would say that is
  pretty sloppy level design to allow all these tricks.
