  Description :-)
  
  This is a hard map to survive at this speed.  I use a
  trick where you don't have to do all the stuff after
  getting the blue key, but that means you can't use
  ssg or berzerk fist for the rest of the level.  I still
  think it is probably worth it though.  There is lots of
  room for improvement.  I think I got 4:45 in a practice
  run, and even that wasn't perfect.
