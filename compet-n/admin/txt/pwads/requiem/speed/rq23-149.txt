Description:
I wasn't satisfied with Xit Vono's view on this map, so I had to record it myself. I got 1:59 quickly, but it was so horrible I couldn't show it to anyone.
After that it tooks many hours and thousands of tries before I got this reasonably good run. In the end it's just 10 seconds though.
Included one fail run where I run the way I wanted but the usual death from behind happens.
