Description:
My 6th entry total, with what seems to be a popular map
(Already had 3 entries from other players :).

Better luck with the demons at the beginning and the end would make a time
of under 1 minute possible, but you'll rarely see both in the same demo.

Trying to see spectres against wood textures and a red haze is a pain, btw.
