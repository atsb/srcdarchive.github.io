  Description :-)
  
  Two tricks in this map, only one of them is new though.
  First of all I cross the slime part by straferunning.  I
  used strafe50, but I think you only need strafe40.  Also,
  I straferun under the falling switch near the red key.
  In this recording I pressed the switch as I ran under it
  and caught the bridge, but there are faster ways to do it
  One way is to go around the switch on the way back, which
  is not too hard, and another way is if you use strafe50,
  sometimes the switch will not fall at all.  This could
  help in nightmare :)

  PS:  Vincent, if you are reading this, why don't you try
       a hand at some of these requiem levels.  It's fun,
       kinda like some of the TNT levels, and there is lots
       of room for improvement.
