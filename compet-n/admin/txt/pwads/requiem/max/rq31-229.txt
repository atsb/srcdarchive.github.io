  Description :-)
  
  One of the best maps I have ever seen! Awesome and beautiful design, great
  conversion from Quake. BTW shouldn't the name be "The Door to Quake"? (The
  original is called "The Door to Chthon") Incredible special effects... my
  favorite level from Requiem. I had some problems with the "gold key" (ok,
  yellow key :) archvile who started reviving everyone but other than that
  everything went well. I leave through the exit to the super-secret level.
