  Description :-)
  
  Great action-packed map, another one of my favourites. It is hard to speed-run,
  mainly because of the arch-vile, but as it is very short you have no time to
  get frustrated. Don't be fooled by the easiness with which I seemingly kill
  everyone: 95% of the time the monsters didn't place themselves "correctly"
  (from my point-of-view, that is, surely not theirs :) and I had to run around
  looking for them. They finally took pity of me, that's all, and this demo is
  the result.
