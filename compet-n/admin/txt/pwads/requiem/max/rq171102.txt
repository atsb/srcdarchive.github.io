  Description :-)
  
  It is big map with a lot of monsters. My tactics were to get the plasma gun fast
  to speed up the monster killing. I left a lot of monsters behind and returned
  later to kill them with some bigger weapons, this way the monsters had the
  chance to hide but I used some resurected monsters to get safe 100% kills even
  when someone hides. This time only a silly imp hid (try to find where he is,
  and kill him when you play the map yourself ;-) )
