  Description :-)
  
  A large, and pretty linear map. I'm not a big fan of the ROCKRED and SP_ROCK
  textures, (these dominate the most of the level.) The overall impression was
  still pretty good; smooth gameplay and all. You're never stuck in an area for
  long, and almost constantly on your move through the rooms, (in general,
  these are pretty large, with not too much monsters.) The level is still
  pretty tough, (not too much health around.) It can be handled pretty
  easily as long as you're careful... but I wasn't careful at all in my demo,
  rather pretty reckless to be honest. :) Adam told me I should've taken the
  route with the soulsphere first, so the BFG area wouldn't be so hard
  afterwards. This seems like a good idea.

  Oh and by the way, you can't get more than 50% secrets on this level
