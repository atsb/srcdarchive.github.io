Description: Wonky map to go through, nice to skip the Imp cage trap
and save some time there. Getting the monsters to infight was a bit
annoying though. I also found out that a floor in the room where the
Imps are would raise if you shoot the switch to free yourself from the
cage, meaning it can be impossible to get 100% kills. Another reason to
not fall in the cage I guess. :)
