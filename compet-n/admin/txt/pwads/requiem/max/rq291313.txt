Description:

Apologies to Jonas for erasing his only C-N point. His demo is
simply outstanding. Watch him beating four revenants much nicer
than me. That demo has been also an almost 16 years old record ...

In such a long run something usually goes wrong, one part of another.
In this demo, at least, I can blame the mapper for his faulty
teleporter, as one baron way too late was the biggest problem here.

Mind that I don't see spectres at all in certain areas.

AdamW's magnum opus (as a mapper) is not THAT great, but hey, there
are no old school maps such as this anymore. For example, that item
placement, including health bonuses here and there is awesome :)
Also, the area with an arch-vile, 2 hell knights, 2 revenats, 2
cacos, 2 PEs, 4 mancubi and the BFG is greatly designed.
