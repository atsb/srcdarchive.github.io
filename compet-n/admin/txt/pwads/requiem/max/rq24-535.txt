| Things didn't went as planned... First, I picked up that chainsaw      |
| accidentally, normally I don't use it. Second, I forgot to open the    |
| door to the PE room to awaken them (at 2:14). They should form sort of |
| blockade at the entrance and it is easy to punch them. Ugly ugly ugly  |
| demo. Not happy with the looks, very happy with the time.              |
| Thanks to skepticist for indirect inspiration. If you beat me by just  |
| one second, please share your demo, this is ugliness...                |
