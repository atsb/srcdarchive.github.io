  Description :-)
  
  Nice medieval style small map. Quite an easy one, but if you go for speeding,
  you gotta have some luck how the monsters place themselves, also how they 
  fight each other. Here I had quite extraordinary luck, my second best run was 
  0:56... I checked later, and I did kill all lost souls, luckily...
