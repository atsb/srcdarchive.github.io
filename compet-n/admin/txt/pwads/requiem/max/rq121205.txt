  Description :-)
  
  Not one of the maps I'd like to play more often. You can get lost easily.
  You can't use DCK nor DEU to have a look at it, but I've found out that
  dmapedit (whereever I've got this from, thanx to the programmer) can handle
  it. And this is a must, because there are 23 secrets in that map. And 3
  not to reach at all, one switch should open a door to an armor, but not
  raises but lowers the wall, and 2 others are behind bars and there is
  no teleport exit in that area. Even I don't know always where I am,
  this map completely puzzles me, but I know how to find every monster,
  and which secrets I usually miss (one shotgun near the SSG, the armor
  near the RL and the small sector(s) on the top of the columns in the
  central room. When you can't find a way to the Supercharge, shoot at
  the Baron face nearby and press the button that is now available and
  shoot the next button. Difficult? Maybe you'll have ammo problems at the
  start, so aim well!
