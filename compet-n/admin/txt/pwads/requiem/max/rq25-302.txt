  Description :-)
  
  Barely faster than Jurjako.  I use his route.
  I tried jamming to the Hell Knights, then coming 
  back for the start, but your ammo is shorter and the monsters sit
  on the teleporter somewhat -- certainly a TAS demo would be very 
  quick.
  Surprisingly not easy to miss a late tele-spawner...
  
  Not much of a demo(with lots of mistakes), but any demo that beats
  a RJ demo is worthwhile in my book.
  -fast should be easy, speed or respawn should be interesting,
  and nm will be difficult.
  Thanks to Xit for the motivation, once again.
