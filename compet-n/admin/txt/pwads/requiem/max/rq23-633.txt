  Description :-)
  
  I think Adam's maxdemo here was probably the best demo in the
  requiem demopack.  I especially liked the way he killed all
  the nazis, although I used a different method which I believe
  to be better.  This is definitely a unique map which was fun
  to play.  I did a 6:46 but prboom showed too many monsters
  alive before the boss started shooting, even though I couldn't
  find them wandering around when I watched with iddt.  There
  should be 2 monsters alive at that point: a baron in front
  of the boss, and an arch-vile which can't be killed.  Also,
  50% secrets is the maximum here.
