  Description :-)
  
  The first in a serie of great Iikka maps, it is also the only one (I think,
  at least I didn't hear Adam W. complain about his maps :) which is plagued
  with a bug. This bug shows its ugly face nearly 4 times out of 5, and prevents
  you from getting 100% kills. What is this bug? Well, it's simply an Imp that
  won't teleport in front the Blue Door. Actually, if you wait long enough, it
  *will* eventually teleport as it is bound to recross its teleport line one
  day or another, but then there is no way to kill it in a reasonable time as
  you have to backtrack nearly the whole level to kill it.
