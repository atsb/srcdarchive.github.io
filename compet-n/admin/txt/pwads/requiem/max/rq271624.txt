  Description :-)
  
  Although Iikka is an excellent designer, this level did not really impress
  me a lot. It is extremely large, linear and basic. On the monster side,
  I personally think that revenants really spice up a level, while I'm not a
  very big fan of arachnos and mancubii. Iikka used all these monsters pretty
  frequently in this level. 
  The gameplay is very smooth and "progressive," but I must really say that I
  have seen way better levels done by this author. Requiem 31 comes to mind :)
