  Description :-)
  
  This map is very fun to play: it features some very original fights and areas,
  like the Red Key chase. Unfortunately, it is plagued with 3 bugs or annoyances
  which lessen the fun you can get of speed-running that map. First, my mildest 
  gripe is that it is easy to forget a monster in the Tech Base area behind the 
  Blue Key door. But with practice, this becomes less of a concern. Second
  complaint: there is a bug in the Red Key area that prevents one of the bridge
  from rising about 2 times out of 5. Specifically, it's the bridge activated by
  the switch in the Imps room (the one with 2 Imps and a Demon). I've looked at
  it with DCK but I couldn't figure out what caused it. And finally, another 2/5
  of the time one of the 2 end Barons will not teleport. I know what this is
  caused by (the first baron teleports then moves over the 2nd Baron's teleport
  exit thus preventing him from teleporting), but that doesn't help very much as
  Doom monsters are known for their randomness...
