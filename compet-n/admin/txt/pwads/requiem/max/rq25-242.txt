  Description:
  Thought that I might just as well try this map max as well... The start is ok,
  I have a clear plan here, release first monster batch, kill knights, release the
  second batch and then kill off everything in the area. Then run to the switch in 
  the blue key room and then to the key. From here I don't have a plan at all... the 
  monsters never behave the same and the archvile can be nasty if he parks himself in
  the intersection or hides behind monsters.
  
  Thanks to Doug for his demo, it helped. I bet you can take this down to 2:00-2:30
  somewhere pretty easily.
