  Description :-)
  
  A very fun level; compared to the complexity of other Requiem maps, this one is
  refreshingly fast and straightforward.  It also has a bizarre special effect:
  a sector where monsters go stupid, and rockets no longer harm you!  Other parts
  to watch are the BFG guarded by six arachnotrons, and the rocket-fight at the
  yellow door (VERY dangerous!)  This map is about medium difficulty, with all the
  weapons and tons of ammo available...however you do need to save about 200 cells
  for the final spider-battle.
