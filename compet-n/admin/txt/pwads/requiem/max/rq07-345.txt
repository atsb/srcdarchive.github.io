  Description :-)
  
  
  Oh man, I just love MAP07 maps! This one, not *really* good, but still quite
  fun to play as it is... Not a really hard map, it gets a bit nasty though when
  you start playing faster... you can catch those mancubi shots quite easily.
  Quite annoying that sometimes some arachnotrons refuse to teleport.
  Nice scene with the chaingunner and me cooperating on a revenant :)
