  Description :-)
  
  Certainly the hardest of the maps that I did. Beautiful design with a very
  authentic medieval castle/dungeon style (I was born in a town with a castle
  from the 12th century in where I played as a child, that makes me an expert).
  It is pretty hard to fight with 29 Revenants (ok not all at one time but still)
  without any armor.. I made 2 lmps, in the first I left with zero ammo, in this
  I leave with 2 shells! More ammo and an early armor would make this map really
  great..
