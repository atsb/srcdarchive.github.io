  Description :-)

  Ugh!  'Nuff said.  There are WAY too many secrets in this level (27 I believe),
  some of which aren't accessable.  The level itself is way too large (Adam W.
  says that this level was originally larger than what it is now... yikes),
  it weighs in at about 550K.  This is probably the least impressive map in
  Requiem.  Also, it's very common to have a lone chaingunner or imp to stay
  behind and make you drop to 99% kills...
