Description:

In this run, I was able to kill 7 demons with 15 shots of a shotgun,
14 shots is perfect though, needless to say. I killed them with 14
shots only one time, but I made a mistake in the second half, and
the run ended up with 1:04. It was not easy for me to finish the 
latter part of this map without shot errors or movement errors.
I think the time is pretty good.
