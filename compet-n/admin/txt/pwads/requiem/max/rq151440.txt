  Description :-)
  
  A DCK map :) But the standard texture is nice. This map is fun to play,
  strong monsters, but also the right weapons. I could have watched the
  teleporting demons (pigs) much longer, but I had to pay attention to my time :)
  The ammo is placed the way you need it, that's better in maps with a 
  high hitpoints/ammo ratio (see dmtha.exe :) But as always they've put
  some pigs and a berserk in, cheating a little bit for a high ratio, that
  isn't that high. I thought I would have problems when I watched demo3
  (yes, they've put the demo for that map in), but I hadn't at all.
  I had once an easy Baron trap, maybe because I hadn't killed the Pain
  Elemental on this side? The pigs trap is a lot easier when you stand on
  on of the teleport exits. Tricky, isn't it? Hope noone creates telefragging
  pigs one day ... :) I was surprised to see that the Archvile wasn't at the
  exit, but fortunatly I could return and trigger his line. I really recommend
  3 SSG shots on him, if you don't have enough rockets to kill him from
  the secret exit (see demo3 for bad luck ...). The normal exit is behind the
  Hell Knight I visited before, btw.

  PS: To all deathmatchers: small and beautiful deathmatch area in that map.
