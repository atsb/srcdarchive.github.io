  Description :-)
  
  This is a pretty small, but very violent level.  Jonas'
  route is pretty good to start with, so I only made minor
  changes to it.  It's hard to stay alive and play at a very
  fast pace, and also you have to watch your ammo, because
  it's easy not to pick up enough shells.
