  Description :-)
  
  This map is very similar to Map24, except that the armor appears even later 
  (!) and the monsters are more varied (there are only 6 Revenants instead of 
  29). Ammo is still a problem if you don't want to waste time collecting dead 
  guys' shotguns. The hardest part is of course the Arachnotrons/Barons/
  Arch-Vile room but I think I handled it pretty well.
