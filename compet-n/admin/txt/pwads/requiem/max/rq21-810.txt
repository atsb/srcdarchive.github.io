  Description :-)
  
  This is one weird level, but that's OK because I love weird levels :). But
  what I like less is that this is the buggiest level I've ever seen, too, at
  least for an otherwise high-quality megawad like Requiem. Let's start by the
  beginning:

  1) Any demo recorded with the original Map21 will desynch. To solve that, I
  had to extract Map21 and recompile it with BSP 2.3x. The new MAP21 is included
  in this package under the name R21.WAD. You must add this wad to the -file
  parameter when watching the MAP21 demo.

  [ It's named as REQ21FIX.WAD at COMPET-N and you can find it under the REQUIEM ]
  [ directory.  -- Admin                                                         ]

  2) 100% kills is not achievable. A bunch of monsters, which should be awakened
  while fighting in the area where you walk on the sky, are not. This is due to
  the weird way by which the sectors are defined in this area. Maximum kills is
  around 96%, depending on how many monsters the Archie revive.
  3) 100% secrets is not achievable either. The guilt falls upon a sector
  surrounding the Megasphere at the end (the lift, I think). This sector is
  defined as secret, but it is so thin that you cannot penetrate it far enough
  for it to register as a found secret. Maximum secrets is 88%.

  But despite all that, I still like that map :). It is so varied, in its
  architecture as well as its fights, that it never becomes boring.
