  Description :-)
  
  If anyone is still wondering why Iikka Keränen was hired by ION Storm after 
  playing through Requiem, well, they seriously have to open their eyes or
  clean their monitor or something :). At the risk of repeating myself or Adam
  W., this is another great Iikka level. From the start, where you escape from a
  dark, isolated cell, to the end where you self-destruct a huge reactor,
  everything is beautifully structured and textured. The only hard feature of
  that map would be the many close-quarters fights, another Iikka trademark,
  but there is enough health to keep you in good shape. Didn't I see that mine
  shaft before, though? :)
