  Description :-)
  
  Yuck. One of my least favourite maps in Requiem. First the standard texture
  (BROWN1) is just awful. Then, when you finally learn the level
  and your possible route, things are starting to go bad. Like Istvan said
  before, you'll want to use plasma here a lot if you wanna finish fast.
  But, this is the perfect example of the "lost monster map". I had
  many many tries with 98-99% of kills. It was quite hard to come up with
  this one.
