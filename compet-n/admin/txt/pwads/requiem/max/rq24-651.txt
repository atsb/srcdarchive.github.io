  Description :-)
  
  This is one of my favourite maps of the lot, finally a map that actually
  requires you to *think* about the way you'll take care of the baddies instead
  of just giving you a SSG and a shitload of shells. Oh, and the architecture is
  top-notch, too :). There are 2 things that make this map look much harder than
  it actually is: first, the hardest part is right at the beginning, which is
  slipping in and out of the Blue Key area alive and with the key, preferably :).
  Second, everything, and I mean *everything* (weapons, ammo, health, armor), is
  in secret areas. So the first time you play this you may find yourself a
  little overwhelmed, to say the least, but after a long look with DCK despair
  may slowly turn to hope :). Another thing: even with all the secret stuff
  there's not enough ammo to kill everyone. I solve that by berseck-punching a
  few revenants.

  Note: No, I don't have any idea what happened in the stairs before the Yellow
  door...
