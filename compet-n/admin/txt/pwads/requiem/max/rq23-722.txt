  Description :-)
  
  Thanks everyone for leaving that one to me :)
  This map is one of my favourites, it comes from one of the best level
  designers, Dario Casali. It really has that famous Plutonia feel...
  3 cyberdemons altogether, all wasted with BFG as they should be.
  Nice trick with the ghosts, they don't mean too much challenge though,
  go to HR map24 for some better example :) Had some trouble killing
  all 12 ghosts, in fact this was my only try where I managed it.
  Still trying to find a way to kill THAT arch-vile :))
