  Description :-)
  
  This map was made by one of the famous Plutonia brothers. I expected that this
  map would not contain ammo problems, and I didn't find such problems at all.
  Well designed map with some special effects, like ghost monsters who can walk 
  through walls and invisible sectors...  
  Only one (little) mistake is that 100% secrets are not possible, the door to
  the second secret area is just too low, I couldn't fit through, maybe I'm too
  fat ;-))
