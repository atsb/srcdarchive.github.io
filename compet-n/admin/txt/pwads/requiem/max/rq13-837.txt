  Description :-)
  
  This is a really, really great level. It's linear, but the fact isn't shoved
  in your face. The enemy placement is great, mainly. Not a particularly hard
  level except for the start if you do it by the method I do (which is the
  fastest). Since I recorded the demo i've figured out a couple of bits that I
  could do faster (SSG the first demon pack instead of punching is the biggest
  one) but I haven't been able to beat this time using those methods :).
