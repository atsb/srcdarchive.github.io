C-N entry #126.

This level is pure genius, so thanks to
Iikka for creating it (and bringing back
some fond memories as well :).  Also thanks
to Yonatan and Adam for showing how this
level should be played.

This demo went about as well as I could have
wanted.  I had several bits of luck going here,
including some generous alignment kills and no
respawned monsters from the archviles, who were
behaving quite nicely for once. ;)
