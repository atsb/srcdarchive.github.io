  Description :-)
  
  I like this map, so I thought I'd do a max-kill for it.
  There are a few faults with it though.  The first is that a
  potion and a dead shotgunner does not make a good secret.
  Also Prower says some secrets are inaccessable, so I 
  got 86%, same as he did.  I also got a visplane near the
  rl, but that's pretty rare.
