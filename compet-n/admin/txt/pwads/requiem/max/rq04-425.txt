  Description :-)
  
  This is my first max kills demo.  It's about time I learned
  how to do them.  I had a few screw-ups that cost a second or
  2 each, but I also had some new tricks that saved some time:
  1: I left a couple of spectres to kill with the ssg
  2: I let the chaingunners kill 3 spectres/demons
  3: I flipped the switch before going to get the armor
  4: I fought those 4 cacos at the end.  That way there is no
     wait for the bars at the end.
  These methods pretty much cancel out the screw-ups and I got
  a slightly better time than the record.
