  Description :-)
  
  That's a large map. Yep. Did I mention that it's a large map? Yes? Well, then,
  I could say that the PE fight (yes, THAT one, with the bridges) can easily
  degenerate into chaos and that yes, it's a very stupid way to fight at the
  bridge (no, not THAT one, the one at the end), but I survived, so who
  gets the last laugh, huh? :)
