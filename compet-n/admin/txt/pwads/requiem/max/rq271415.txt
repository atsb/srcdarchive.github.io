Description: Surprised nobody thought of replaying this map or anything,
I think this is one of the better maps in the WAD and is one of my
favorites. Now going under 15 minutes was definitely possible, and with
my run here, going under 14 minutes should also be possible! Being a
long map, I sometimes forget where I was supposed to go or do which is
funny since it is actually pretty linear.

I got some good infighting going in some places, some a little tricky to
pull off while others are not too difficult to do. Ammo is tight so use
shells and cell ammo well, same for rockets. Don't mind bullets too
much, there's plenty on this map. Sometimes it might be better to forget
trying to make the monsters fight each other and just kill them
outright, assuming they are spending too much time wandering around.
Going for multiple kills with the BFG is one way to improve, I kind of
wished it was done better here in some spots. I might go back to this
map at some point.

Happy New Years!
