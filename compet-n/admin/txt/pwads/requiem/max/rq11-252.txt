| LOL. At 0:06 I pressed space (I *think* I did) to open one secret, in  |
| order to have easier access to it later. Well, I didn't open it. Now I |
| think, maybe it is better to keep it closed, as monsters will occupy   |
| more predictable places? Anyway, I had 2:59, 3:13, 3:10 and 3:05 and   |
| this run surprised me a lot. It's almost 10 years after the previous   |
| record was set!! IMO, this is the very best map of Requiem. I may try  |
| -respawn next, although the most possible result will by vdgg shouting |
| not-so-decent words during recording :)                                |
