==============================================

There's just one problem with finishing this level in
-respawn category. The ammo is just enough for UV Max
and the monsters which reappear are mostly imps and
demons, so running out of shells is quite common here.
There are various strategies to soothe this problem.

One strategy is present in rr041235. At first I though
it was a joke: "The first 7 1/2 minutes are spent waiting
for the first three guys to respawn. I might suggest
starting it and taking a break for about 7 min." Hehe.
Xit Vono just waited until he had 50 shells.

My strategy is to use pistol against first three guys.
Kill the imps, lure the HK outside (sometimes a sergeant
or two respawn, so I have > 20 shells left). The I try
not to kill the demons, since every respawned demon
makes it closer to an empty backpack (I mean, no ammo).
I just weaken the demons to kill them later quickly.
And that's it. My time is slower than UV Max (4:10), but
I actually was pretty close to it. With a successful
exit bars trick I would've had about 4:20 and exactly 100%
kills. So, TGH, if you're reading this, I look forward
to your demo on this map.

I'm not going to improve this time at the moment after
all the difficulties I experienced. The HK at the switch
respawning right away; demons which ALWAYS make 40% damage.
Hell Knights which ALWAYS make 64% damage. Demons which
survive SSG shots at point blank range. And, last but
not least, one thing which I fail to understand: the BK.
If it's possible to grab the key without teleporting,
how is it possible to TELEPORT WITHOUT TAKING THE KEY??

Good luck to anyone who wants to try this!
