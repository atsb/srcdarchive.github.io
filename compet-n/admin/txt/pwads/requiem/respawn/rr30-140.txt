Description:

This level still sucks, but I managed to have more health when I went
into the end room, plus the "self-destructing Imps" as I call them
(since they squish each other coming out of their teleporter cages)
helped out on getting the 100% kills.

This run wasn't nearly as aggravating as the Max I did for this level,
and getting the Cacos and Hell Knights to crossfire went really well.

On to something else, this maps a little aggravating now... >.<
