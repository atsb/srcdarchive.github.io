  Description :-)
  
  This is a relatively hard map to play -respawn style.
  The best style is to get all the secrets right away, and
  when you get the red key, run as quickly as possible to the
  exit before all the monsters teleport.  The obvious
  question is whether it can be done in Nightmare, and I
  think it would probably be very hard, but I should be able
  to do a TAS recording.
