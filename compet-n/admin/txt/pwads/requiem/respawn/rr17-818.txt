  Requiem – Map 17 – UV Respawn

As usual, I always keep sucking at this map, but unlike the previous times I did this level, I at least try to be fast here, because it doesn't really feel good for me to have a lot of unneeded time in my demo. The only time which I could probably count as “good wasting” is the part after I get all the keys and I start spamming plasma on all the enemies so I can rack up kill count.
