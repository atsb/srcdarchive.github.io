  Description : The ending can be very hard if everything respawns due to ammo problems. The                 Chaingunner platform near the end is either a mean trap or a bug. If it                     takes you up you won't be able to go back down. I learned this the hard way                 and I was quite mad. The "Baron of Hell in front, Hell Knight behind me"                    part was everything but funny. My keyboard wouldn't probably survive if I                   died there. Despite all the nerves it was worth it. :)
