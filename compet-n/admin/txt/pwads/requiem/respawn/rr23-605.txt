Description:

I save the invul for the boss brain. The worst moment is running the
ledge (about 5:05 in this demo), I die 19 times out of 20 there. Kudos
to Xit for NM100 and calling it "easy". Also nice demos by xepop and
Istvan are not to be missed!

I had 8:05 but was too ashamed of it so I tried many times and
eventually got more or less what I was aiming for.
