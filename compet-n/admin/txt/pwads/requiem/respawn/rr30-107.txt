Description:

Vono's time for this map had me slightly worried (1:19 wasn't a bad time). I didn't
think I could take it back, and using his route, I couldn't. So, I had to come up
with my own ^^'

There's not really much to say about this run, but it beats Vono by 12 seconds.

The run ends in style...I get nuked by an Arch-Vile ^_^

Oh yeah...exactly 100% kills too
