Description:

This one was difficult for me on -respawn mostly because every frikkin' time
I'd finish off the Cacos and go after the Arch-Vile room, the Cacos would
start respawning and sneaking up behind me while I'm rocketing the Vile room.
I died numerous times to get this, and I know it could be easily beaten by a
good minute.

The reason this is long is because the way I do this level is by getting the
Cacos all clustered together and then just Chaingun them all, then SSG the
rest. I did this one more for fun, but it eventually became frustrating >.<

I'd say optimal would be equal to the Max-Kill's optimal...although I'm not
THAT good... ^^'

Oh yes, the end was luck. The suicidal Arch-Vile really helped me...I thought
I was a dead man while he was standing there...

Anyone for -fast or below 2:00? ^_^
