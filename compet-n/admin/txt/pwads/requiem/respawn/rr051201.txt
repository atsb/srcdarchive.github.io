  Description :-)
  
  This respawn stuff can be quite fun if you don't worry
  about time or having to get 100% kills.  Most of it is
  easy, but things can get a little hectic near the red key
  and at the end.  Once I accidentally exited and only got
  50% secrets, but that was using a different route.
