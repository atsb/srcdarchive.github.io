Description :-)

Hi there, I finally plugged my DOS/Doom PC and enjoyed real Doom!
This was my first 100% exit, I had 6:04 with 98% kills so that's
why I was killing everything on my way at the end. This map is true
poison, you can die anywhere so I played safe this one just to show
a little bit different tactic and heh I din't play for ages.
This was really easy to achive but good time would be ~5:20.
