General comments:
-----------------

I've been doing these LMPs for more than 2 years now, so I thought
I take the chance and publish them now that DANG accepts -nomonsters
runs. Besides that, I thought it's time to set the pace for everyone
else, I'm curious how many people can do better than these.

I admit my skills aren't the same over each map, so there are better
and worse LMPs in these. E.g. don't take MAP19 too seriously (I don't
want to bother too much with the jump), neither MAP24 (I suck here),
or MAP21/MAP22 (no gliding).
Some LMPs are pretty nice I think, personally I like MAP09 because
of its different (and faster) ending part, MAP13 of its first ever
non-cheated sub-1-min time (if I'm right), and MAP29 of its nice
flying jump out of the first elevator.
There are some hard-worked LMPs in there, if I remember well it
was quite hard to do MAP02, MAP11 and MAP18 with those times.

I give you people 2 challenges here:
- beat my MAP02 time.
- beat my total time of 18:52.
Enjoy the LMPs and good luck! ;-)

PS. Ralf: Put this into /misc or wherever, but don't make a player
profile of me just because of this for Christ's sake! :)
