comments:       Well...after I did 37.08 here before month or two
                I was pissed as hell, didn't
                played this map in nomo since then...but tonight Adam H.
                sended me his nomo run in 37.97...to be honest
                when I saw his demo I decide to do 36 emidiatly couse I
                wasn't anymore onlyone who have 37 :). Anyway, thanks Adam. 

                Ps. This is ofcourse strafe40 only, like every nomo record
                I hope (except maps where strafe50 is needed for some tricks)
                and please guys don't ruin fun in this nomo compet-n with
                it...I think it just wouldn't be fair.
