Comments:       I wanted to make it in 28 seconds but surprisingly got 28.34 on
                first exit so I just had to try 27.xx :) There are several mistakes. Turning after
                invulnerability. Turning after yellow key (got stuck to the wall) and right after
                hitting the button to raise the stairs I got stuck too long to the button. Last turning
                wasn't good either (I ran the outer side and hit the wall too). Oh well, it's 27.
