Comments:       Heh funny... I remember back with the legacy source port, I grinded so bad for
		49seconds, then I played with vanilla and I had problems with 49sec, about 2 months
		ago. Today morning I woke up and first try: 48seconds. This evening I try again 
		and 3rd exit is this (4th exit today). S40 only :)
