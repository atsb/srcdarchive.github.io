  Description:  

  This is a demo I never expected to get for a very long time. Once again
  thanks have to go to Vincent. Back in March 2005 I was chatting to him
  in #nightmare, and he was putting together a collection of everybody's
  nightmare demos that would eventually go onto some website he was running.
  I cobbled together a H1DSS and H2DSS pack for him, and he encouraged me
  to think about doing the D1SS and D2SS. So I started practising the
  episodes and got an 11-20 movie on 27-03-2005, followed by a 21-30 movie
  a week later. But I never made the transition to starting practice on an
  30ns, mainly because the first episode is no fun at all to record, and
  I still didn't think I could do the full movie anyway.

  For all of 2006 I basically left the idea alone. Some time early this year
  though I started playing through from map01 again, at first I think just
  to see what sort of improvement I could get time-wise over my very old
  23:32 (dishearteningly, not much). But map12 turned out to be a very big
  barrier and I collected maybe half a dozen tries dying there in some
  fashion. Finally on 24-02-2007 I passed the level, finally dying in very
  stupid fashion (rocket to the face) on map17. Since I knew from my episode
  runs that the levels beyond 20 weren't much harder on nm100s than regular
  nm, I at least knew now that I could theoretically do this.

  But I stopped practising again. It still didn't seem possible, and I don't
  have the stamina for long doom recording sessions again. What finally got
  me to take this seriously was that Vincent finally put up his webpage :)
  I sent him in a D1SS he didn't have and that one final gap was too glaring
  to put up with anymore. I sat down and started practising.

  I knew the first episode fairly well from earlier in the year, my main
  weakness was a lack of route knowledge in later maps. So I did hundreds of
  small fillup runs, first on individual levels like 15, 17, 27 and so on,
  and later in groups of three or four or five. The idea was to have to
  record as few full runs as possible. If I got a run through to 12 and died
  there, I'd start a fillup session and get to 17, say, and then extend that
  with another fillup run, and so on. So I didn't get many runs beginning
  from 01 but got in plenty of practice at the later levels.

  Last weekend, 27-10-2007, I finally achieved a run dying arbitrarily on
  map22, this was followed the next day with a run dying on map18. Six days
  later I got this.

  The run mostly went fairly well. I was a bit nervous in later maps because
  I hadn't gotten so far in a single run before, and while my fingers knew
  the routes I'd occasionally overthink things, so I'm heading one way then
  another (map28 has a pretty glaring example of this). Also I wasn't sure if
  I got all secrets but luckily they all registered. map17 was probably the
  worst map, I released the cacos at the start and the buggers wouldn't leave
  me alone... But I was quite surprised with the overall time, was expecting
  maybe ~77min or so. Looks like under 70 is in reach :)
  
  So that's done at last, I'm very proud of it, fourth player ever to achieve
  this and, I hope everyone notes, the only keyboarder :)
