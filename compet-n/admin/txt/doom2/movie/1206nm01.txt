  Some Comments:  Is there a more frustrating task than playing
                  NightMare/Speed combined? Not that I know of...


  Level 01:       All hell breakes lose, when running through this one.

  Level 02:       I HATE this level in NightMare mode, and trying to
                  speed through doesn't extacly make things easier...

  Level 03:       Should be easy, I often die here though...

  Level 04:       Almost as frustrating as level 2, sometimes worse..

  Level 05:       This is easy if you have some luck at the chaingunners.

  Level 06:       Very easy level, my finish isn't very good though......

  Level 07:       Quite satisfied with the time.

  Level 08:       A lot easier than level 1.

  Level 09:       Quite easy. Only problem is when letting the caco and
                  the imps out.

  Level 10:       Thought it would be a little more exciting to watch
                  if I ended it with 2% health...... Not.
