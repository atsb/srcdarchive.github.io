C-N entry #35, movie run #9.

My progress on the 30ns has been good so far; this was one attempt I didn't feel like
continuing, but it turned out to be faster than the previous run.  As for the
30ns itself, I'd better tell you now that you shouldn't keep your hopes up. :)

While the 30ns will come eventually, it will probably not be faster than Henning's run,
so don't expect anything new.  I'm taking this opportunity to challenge myself by doing
this run, and it will be a run that I'll be proud of, regardless of the time.

In case you're wondering, the farthest I've gotten in my attempts is level 24, so
I'm getting close, but don't expect it anytime soon. :)
