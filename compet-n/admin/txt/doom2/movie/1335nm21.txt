       13:35

	I recently thought about implementing the trick, it saves a lot of time.
        Map22 w/ only 100/0 health armor isn't that easy but I could do it
        quite consistently in my later tries.

	2 maps are completely fucked up, map27 (15s lost) and map30 (should be under 1:00).
        And map29 could be under 3:00...
    
        Next time under 13:00 :)
