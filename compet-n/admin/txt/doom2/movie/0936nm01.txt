  Description : Hehe, this was fun. This episode is great for practice.	
                Well, now I'm sure that I can make it till map20 ;)).
                Time for whole thing is closer and closer. Before I would
                like to try episode3 and then... ;)).
             
        map01 : Four times I got 5 sec. but 6 is also ok ;).

        map02 : Time is ok. I had runs in 1.08 but also I had in 1.30 so
                I'm satisfied with this time. Strange map.

        map03 : Because this one I'm not proude on whole run. Terrible
                mistake. Panter forgot chaingun in his run but I forgot to
                press the switch. Ok, I did one cool thing after and that's
                the only reason why I continued to play. Enyway, time sucks.

        map04 : Everything went just fine.

        map05 : I played this one a little bit risky ;)).

        map06 : Great map. All jumps ok, time also ok.

        map07 : Uf, I hate this one. I died here many times.
                This time I was lucky ;)).

        map08 : Stupid mistake, didn't watch how many cells I had.
                I didn't needed more but for this route it's a good time.

        map09 : What to write here...nice map.

        map10 : Time is slow, I played it very careffuly cause I died few
                times here.
                Enyway it was fun ;))))))).
