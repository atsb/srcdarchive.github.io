  Description :-)

  ... Slow - But Good ... (that's right)

What to say, ahem ? Each single level can be played faster. I think the really
hard limit would be a time under 13 minutes ! (If I add my personal best times
from scratch it would work, check out this coming LMPs, I'm currently writing
these !($)#'~#%&!$! (wanted this one to be readable under 18) TXTs (hate it) !)

[ Admin. Note :-) Well, that is exactly as it came in... I've checked
  the table and it's Perfect ! 'Anthe' has already done a faster time
  (15:17) as a "lightning style" FREE.LMP in his D2SG-AAK "DHT" exam.
  - Check that one out... Or wait for his next one ;-) I have no idea
  what that last bit meant ;-( ? )
