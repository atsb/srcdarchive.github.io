Description: About the levels:

             Well, this entry is a lot faster than my old
             one, by about 4 mins !

             Certain levels could be played somewhat faster
             but overall I'm rather satisfied.

             Level 12 could be faster, 13 & 15 too, 17 is a
             disaster (the end...).

             I'll break the 01-10 record too, watch it !
