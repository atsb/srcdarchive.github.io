  Description:
 
  After a year since my last 30nm, I got some good inspiration to play
  this by Vile, his recent movies rule. I've got a strange feeling about
  the demo, it's 2mins improvement over my last personal record, but
  it coulda been much better. Most of the maps I did quite fast, like
  map17 and map29, the best times I ever got in 30nm, but I also really
  fucked up the other couple of map07 and map30. I lost about 1m30s there
  at least which is kinda disappointing. I'm uploading this anyway,
  however this is not my fastest 30nm! I've got one clocking 35:00,
  but I don't like that one much. I think I'm not done with 30nm runs yet,
  the next one is gonna be my 7th, so we'll see whether it's a lucky
  number or not.
