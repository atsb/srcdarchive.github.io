  LV 12  -    3:14    2:30    no probs, everything went perfectly, the route is good IMO.
  LV 13  -    3:32    2:30    it's ok except at the end where i miss the 100% sphere

Total        30:28   


Description: Hmmm cool, it's my first ever run where i finish map09. but i practised the 
             remaining maps with fillup... i was ready for all maps before map18.
             
	     I died in map14 because i skipped the archie (let him alive) => BIG error.

	     Next time i'll beat map15, because i already did it with fillup w/o too much pain.
