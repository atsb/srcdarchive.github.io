C-N entry #205, movie run #39.

Under 30 mins is quite possible, as you can see.
Had I gotten a faster map30 it would have happened.
Oh well, it is guaranteed to happen eventually, so I'm
already happy to have accomplished this much.  At
least some time was shaved off from the previous run
so this map30 doesn't look quite as ugly.  Now then,
onto the real clincher for the sub-30 times: the new
map27 route.

It seems that even though the archvile will attack you
immediately, he can still be coaxed into opening the
door from outside the room if you're in the right
position.  This tactic was even used in the earliest
nightmare speed record using the archie trick.  So,
go in, kill off the enemies, then teleport out.

The real trick to this was knowing when the archie has
opened the door... for me currently, it's impossible
to tell directly until I get win98 and get sound back.
However, when I practiced the route, I learned a good
way to time it instead... from the moment I reach the
corner to wait, I count off 7 seconds, then run for
the exit.  I tried it on a whim this time and got lucky,
and it payed off immensely.

Anyway, perhaps the next 30nm you see, whether from me
or Henning, will be past the mark. :)
