Description :-)

YEAH... finished at last :)
5 MINUTES AND 15 SECONDS FASTER...

Thought of doing this after I snatched the 01-10 and 11-20 run
records... I didn't have the slightest idea what time I would get...
DL's 36:09 seemed so fast and perfect as I remembered.
I tried hard and got to the end one time... this was actually the
first time ever that I played through DOOM2 non-stop without savegames/dying...
calculated the time and surprisingly it was 32:11... it felt really
good to beat DL's time by such a margin. However I had two reasons
why I didn't upload. MAP29 was awful, fell down twice in the last
room and time was a miserable 2:43. I found out that with better running
I could've done under 32 minutes... Which was very tempting, 32 maps
under 32 mins :)

I had to try a lot to get this run. This was the 2nd time ever reached
MAP30. I'm a dying type of guy, my times are good but I always die :)
I died in nearly all the maps in nearly all ways, but from each death
I learned something.

Now about this run. First 10 maps came excellent, just 21 seconds shy
of the record time. Don't think I could improve on this by much.
Next 10 (12 rather) maps, time is good and steady. No real problems.
The last (and hardest part), time seems okay, only 17 seconds off
the record time. However I had serious trouble here and I guess this
is the part which can be improved most.
All in all I was faster than DL in 26 maps, in 3 I equalled him, and
only 3 where I was slower. Think this is cool ;)

Well I really hope I don't get beaten by another 5 mins 15 secs :)
Under 30 mins would be more thoughtful to aim at... it's definately
possible.

I wanna thank all the COMPET-N players who provided routes/tricks
over the years which I used. Very special thanks to Daniel Lindgren
for all the runs he made. This demo is dedicated to him. 

Some info on the maps:

MAP01 (Entryway):
  Exact time is 6.14... :)
MAP02 (Underhalls):
  I decided that I don't go for fast times here because this
  map isn't so important here as in 10-level runs. Time is
  surprisingly good though...
MAP03 (The Gantlet):
  Really annoying piece of map to play.
MAP04 (The Focus):
  Time is very slow, I was sloppy at the elevator...
MAP05 (The Waste Tunnels):
  Quite nice time. The end part is my usual dying place :)
MAP06 (The Crusher):
  Some damn hard jumps in this one, times can range from
  1:00 to 1:30... Very satisfied with this run.
MAP07 (Dead Simple):
  My favourite DOOM2 map. Time is a bit slow. My best in a
  run was 0:53, but on the other hand I never got outside
  1:10.
MAP08 (Tricks and Traps):
  Another "luck" map. Time is good.
MAP09 (The Pit):
  Time is good, I was a bit sloppy at the demons though.
  I thought about leaving some cells for MAP10 and I had
  to use SSG... maybe not the best solution.
MAP10 (Refueling Base):
  That's it about those cells... they didn't really help.
  Damn cyber got in the way...
MAP11 (Circle of Death):
  Quite the usual.
MAP12 (The Factory):
  Uhhh.... nearly died here. Down to 11%... think I was lucky
  in there :)
MAP13 (Downtown):
  Nothing really special here...
MAP14 (The Inmost Dens):
  Very good time, had some health problems though...
MAP15 (Industrial Zone):
  Time is casual, bit worried about the 100/6 health/armor
  ending...
MAP31 (Wolfenstein):
  ...no need to worry though, only lost 30%.
MAP32 (Grosse):
  Superb time.
MAP16 (Suburbs):
  Nearly flawless run.
MAP17 (Tenements):
  Lost 5-6 secs because of that damn revenant, otherwise good.
  Very happy that both hard jumps were succesful on first try.
MAP18 (The Courtyard):
  No problems.
MAP19 (The Citadel):
  Yeah well, what happened here? My mouse went crazy.... it
  happens sometimes, guess my mousedriver has some problems...
MAP20 (Gotcha!):
  Good and safe run.
MAP21 (Nirvana):
  Guess this is the optimal time using the megasphere route...
MAP22 (The Catacombs):
  Very good run till the baron... all sorts of problems
  afterwards... BFG shot wasted.... wrong weapon etc.
  Think I was lucky to get out with good health.
MAP23 (Barrels o' Fun):
  A very problematic map. Died here many times. Both time and
  health excellent in this run.
MAP24 (The Chasm):
  Everyone's favourite map :)
  Got in trouble with the demons... should've changed to BFG...
  Fool!... 10 secs lost there.
MAP25 (Bloodfalls):
  Another problem map. Hate the megasphere/arachnotron room...
  another favourite dying place. No problems this time.
MAP26 (The Abandoned Mines):
  A very cell-consuming map. 3 BFG shots and some extra cells
  fired. I should've used BFG on the caco...
MAP27 (Monster Condo):
  Argh what a run.... nearly died there, think I was quite
  unlucky. Another extremely foolish weapon change in the end...
MAP28 (The Spirit World):
  Uhhhhhhhhh.... from 200/200 down to 28/31 in two secs :(
  I gave myself 1% chance to survive MAP29 at this point...
MAP29 (The Living End):
  The mid part was the fight of my life... very exciting stuff
  to watch :) The end part was surprisingly easy in comparison.
MAP30 (Icon of Sin):
  Dunno how I could stay so cool and get those rockets in after
  31 nerve-wrecking levels...
