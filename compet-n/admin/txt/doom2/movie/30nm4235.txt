  Description:  I had access to my old computer again over the Christmas
                break so I thought I might take another shot at a D2S
                demo. As it turned out this didn't take long to do,
                as you can see I'm uncertain at a number of points -
                map08 in particular is a bit of a fiasco :) But it all
                came back very fast and the second half of the demo is
                pretty quick. Anyway, based on this demo a time of <40 min
                would have to be the aim... maybe I'll go after that
                when I get some more spare time.
