  A nice 20s improvement over my previous record, that's what I 
  was going for, I really wanted to put it under 9mins. I included
  the long jump in map29 and what more, just 3-rocket end in map30,
  which is nice too. The overall look of the demo coulda been better tho,
  it's my first dooming after a few weeks. One more thing, I didn't try
  the glide trick in map21, coz I never made it, but if someone wants to
  beat this, it's the thing to start with.
