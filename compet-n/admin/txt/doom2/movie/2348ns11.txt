C-N entry #33, movie run #7.

My 30ns practice continues.. these levels were quite a bit more fun than the first 10,
IMO.  They're also a bit easier, only a few maps(12,17) gave me problems sometimes.  This
is the first run where I make it past map17, but the final 3 levels weren't threatening at
all.  Hope you enjoy this demo while I work on 21-30. :)
