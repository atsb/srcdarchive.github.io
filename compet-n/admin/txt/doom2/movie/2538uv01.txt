  Serious errors:

    - played level 3 like a moron... I should just grab the
      chaingun and walk off BEFORE letting the imps scratch
      me to heck... :)
    - forgot the rocket ammo near the blue door on level 5
    - I forgot about the "easy" megasphere and went for the
      one farther from the exit instead.  That cost about
      30 seconds.
    - not really serious, but I should have made an attempt
      to beat 1:00 on level 7 since I had the ammo to do it
    - I ought to be able to improve on level 9 by more than
      a minute.  I played it poorly.

  Comments:

  This was the first time I completed the "episode" and my
  5th attempt.  I had never made it to level 10 prior to
  this attempt, so I paused a while longer than normal in
  order to plan my attack of level 10.

  I doubt if I'll compete in this category again; I truly
  detest ending a level without killing everything.  Why
  I went this far is beyond me.  Just watching the demo (to
  get the health/armor values) made me cringe every time I
  by-passed a monster.

  Who is to say what "Acceptable" times are for various levels
  in a 10 level entry?  Just because you took longer on a level
  does not make it unacceptable - provided you used that time
  to get better equipped for the next level.  It's the final
  time that counts, so don't invalidate an entry just because
  one level was done poorly (or differently).

  (BTW, does it count if I get my friend to watch a coop game
  of me wasting level 11 alone? :)  If not, I'll try to get
  him to work with me on the level instead.  He's pretty good,
  and we've deathmatched on the level for hours)

[  Admin. Note :-) Since I can not Email Eric directly, I'll address
   Eric's "comments" here ...

   So it took you five whole attempts to complete this "episode" ;-)
   I had that (level 10) trouble too - to begin with, anyway.

   Do I detect a little lie there - "I doubt" - Addictive isn't it ?

   I believe that you are referring to my own 3644UV01 "example" LMP
   here. Well, the "Acceptable" times were acceptable to just ME, in
   MY own personal aim to break through MY (40 min.) "barrier" - and
   that's all - "It's the final (cumulative) time that counts" ! :-)

   The [ one (of 2 ;-) "no pausing" - and ] only "hard rule" is that
   each of the level times MUST be clearly visable for any "episode"
   to count. If they are NOT :-( Auto DisQualification ! That's All.

   (YES ! If "you" (plus a mate (or even two or three)) can complete
   Level 11 (or a higher level) ... ".LMP - Give!" ... I'll take it!
   New (sub-)category coming soon. If you have no mates around, try:

   > IPXSetup -Nodes 1 -Skill 4 -Warp 11 -MaxDemo ? -Record STAR-LMP

   The only new [ third (of 1 ;-) ] "rule" will be "NO Respawning !"
   If your "mate" gets killed s/he stays dead. If "you" can complete
   this monumental task - YES ! ... ".LMP - Give!" :-)))
