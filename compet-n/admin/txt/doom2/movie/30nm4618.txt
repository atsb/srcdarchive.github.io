  Description :-)
  
  YEAH, I finally did it... lots of trying and finally I managed.

  I first tried this more than a year ago... I got to MAP22 after some trying,
  and with some more tries I got to 25nm last year (44:50 my 25nm time
  back then). After that I haven't really tried since this September, I had
  lots of other challenges and D2S somehow I didn't really want to go for.

  I started trying again about three or four weeks ago, for some time I was
  doing around 54 minute pace, but after some talking with Henning and thinking
  about my tries, I realized it would be quite lame to submit a run outside
  50 minutes. So I made my pace faster, and that's how I managed my 2nd
  25nm (38:48 this time). This was three days ago, after that I had a few
  tries each day but most of them ended at MAP22/MAP23.
  
  It was yesterday when I had a really good run again, I reached MAP29 for the
  first time but died near the exit (28nm4118). The folks at #nightmare witnessed
  this as I reported, they cheered me as I was progressing but I wasn't prepared
  enough for MAP29 so I didn't make it. After that run, I tried again in
  the morning (I know I'm crazy yeah :) and I was surprised that I got
  to MAP29 again and I made it! After that, I thought I made it, but I had
  a terrible MAP30 and I died there (I had an archie and two PE's around).
  I was totally down after that, thought of giving up the whole thing but
  I got really pissed so I sat down again. Next try was a 22nm with dying
  just before the mega. After that I started another try and that turned
  out to be the successful run. I think I'm lucky that I made it with relative
  few tries, but on the other hand getting to MAP22 is no problem for me
  anymore (and I've been doing better and better in the last 10 maps lately).

  This run is not too good if I look at it myself, the first 10 maps are miserably
  slow even with my pace (12:16 compared to my normal 11 min runs). I think
  I could do around 44 minutes with the routes I used here, and of course
  lots of time can be spared with faster routes. As you can see I took safe
  routes all the way, I got under 50% in only 6 maps so that shows that
  health-wise the run went good.
  
  Anyway I'm happy overall, I'm the 4th player managing the D2S and the
  2nd player managing the Superlightning (D2S with all maps under par).

  Of course I'm keeping myself to the D2S habit, so this wasn't the
  last 30nm from me!

  Map descriptions:

  MAP01: Well, 0:06 with 100% is easy... I press "Q" if the time is worse
         or the health is bad.
  
  MAP02: I get SSG to make life easier on MAP03/MAP04. In my earlier tries
         I was doing 1:35-1:40, but I realized I have to speed things up
         if I want to have Superlightning. Still this map is quite easy
         to do around 1:20.
  
  MAP03: A bit slow in this run... otherwise this map is quite easy, and
         not too hard to finish with at least 100/100.
         
  MAP04: Nice map to do in the NM run... I think I never screwed up here.
         Time is a bit slow because I was sloppy around the exit... normally
         have 1:15 here.
  
  MAP05: First part I do slow and safe, then according to my health, I speed
         up as much as I can. The hell knight part is the barrier here, it
         rarely goes wrong but weird things can happen there... My time here
         is OK.
         
  MAP06: Well, quite an embarrassing run here. I missed the first jump and
         had a very nice rocket in my face near the end... Time is 15 seconds
         slower than acceptable. Oh well...
         
  MAP07: Damn, lost 30 seconds here compared to my normal run. This rarely
         happens to me, normally I'm between 0:55-1:05. Anyway I very rarely
         screw here, and normally I press "Q" if the run is starting to suck.
  
  MAP08: Well, what to say... I use the standard route here, never screwed
         up here... Best time is 1:08, this run is OK.
         
  MAP09: One of my favourite maps for NM... full of action gameplay and
         still very easy to do with the right tactics. Quite a slow run
         again, normally it's around 1:30...
         
  MAP10: I try to finish with 100/200 here so I take a safe approach normally.
         Didn't work this time because I lost too much health, time is OK
         though. Best time was 0:59.
         
  MAP11: First map with some challenge... Couple of things can go wrong
         here: archie can have a surprise hit sometimes and cacos/PE's tend
         to fly around annoyingly. I take the jump down to the cacos very
         safe, I fell down many times before when I didn't kill the PE
         there, so I adjusted my tactics and take a few seconds killing
         the PE (the invul lasts enough). Not a favourite of mine...
         
  MAP12: Well, the end room is the only hard part in this map... I take it
         very safe so it's never a problem for me... a place for some time
         improvement later. BTW, had a dream run here, haven't been hit
         in the end room!
         
  MAP13: Easy map with the right strategy... Sometimes the monsters block
         the exit of the yellow key room, but that shouldn't be a big
         problem...
         
  MAP14: Well, quite a long map with this route, luckily there's plenty of
         health and armor to keep you fit. Much faster with Istvan's route,
         but if you do a mistake there then you're busted (especially if
         the door doesn't open for you after the first jump).
  
  MAP15: Not too hard but can be annoying sometimes... If I have more than
         100% health leaving MAP14, I go for the slime part directly, if
         I'm low on health I gather some health and the blue armor.
         I jump on the radsuit/cellpack in the slime, that gives me
         enough cells so I don't have to bother with them in MAP32.
  
  MAP31: What to say... easy map with invisibility. 0:37 my best time with
         this route.
         
  MAP32: Hmmm, much easier to deal with cybie this way I think (shooting
         rockets like a madman doesn't help guys, trust me). Shame that
         I screwed up the exit room and didn't end up with 0:22 as I normally
         do.
         
  MAP16: Easy, but sometimes archie can give you some tough moments. Gotta
         hurry to the exit fast...
         
  MAP17: Wow, probably my nicest run I ever had on this map... Earlier I was
         doing the old route in the arachnotron room but it's really a pain
         to jump down, the spider blocks you at least 80% of the time.
         Much easier with the jump from the side. The end is a bit harder
         without the invisibility but health is more than enough.
         
  MAP18: Well, easy one even if the invul grab doesn't work. Can't really
         screw up here.
         
  MAP19: Nice route this one, Ilya is a wizard :) I kill the caco behind
         the door because it can be annoying when the invul runs out...
         
  MAP20: Easy... there can be some problems if the 2nd pain elemental
         says hello when you're trying to fight the other one, but
         that doesn't happen too many times...
         
  MAP21: Fun and relatively easy map... You just gotta watch your health
         after you grabbed megasphere so you maximize your chances for
         MAP22.
         
  MAP22: Yeah, this map is hard, things easily go wrong here and health
         can disappear like crazy. I practiced here with FILLUP.WAD a few
         times and I was doing nicely, which kept me relatively calm
         in real NM run attempts... Last part is the hardest for me,
         exiting health can be from 140% to 1% (or just dying). Under 30%
         needs extreme luck in MAP23...
         
  MAP23: This map is damn annoying from start to finish, starting out
         with the chaingunner row after the start, then the PE ledge
         after the teleport (I just hate when they blow a barrel into my
         face), and then the run to the megasphere (chaingunners are deadly
         from any distance). Even the archie part near the end can have
         some surprises (early respawning revenants). You need over 150%
         here if you want to leave the mega in MAP24.
  
  MAP24: Hehe, this map is a real nerve-tester with this route. First map
         where I really lost my control, first falling twice from the ledge,
         getting flooded with lost souls; then accidentally stepping into
         the demon room (bad idea) and managing to get out without much harm.
         My normal time would be 1:40 with this route, but 2:04 is not so
         bad after screwing up this bad...
         
  MAP25: Not any favourite of mine... many things can go wrong. Starting room
         I take safe, not wasting too much cells (so I don't run out at the
         end of MAP26), then I clear out the megasphere room as much as I can
         before grabbing the mega. After that it's just running and trying
         to stay healthy, 100/100 in the end is good. The revenant can be
         a real pain if it starts shooting around, so I kill it with plasma.
         
  MAP26: This map can go wrong sometimes, especially if you are low on plasma
         near the end. Cacos are a real pain, so much of them that you can't
         kill all of them. My run here is great, a bit slow but high on health
         in the exit.
         
  MAP27: Whew, nice map to relax after five hard maps. With 3 invuls things
         can't really go wrong...
         
  MAP28: This one is very easy with so many invuls, but some surprising things
         can happen and if you're not reacting well you can get into trouble.
         It's really funny when the spider masterminds step on the invuls
         and you are running out and get ventilated by their chaingun... NOT!!
         Otherwise, the only important thing is to finish with 200/200 and 600
         cells.
         
  MAP29: Yeah, this map is really evil... the longest and hardest map in the
         NightMare run. Cacos can be a pain all the way from start to exit,
         otherwise there aren't too many problem parts till the last area
         (except if you fall down somewhere). The last part is a real bitch,
         just when your hands are trembling the most, comes the hardest part
         in the run :) I was lucky that the barons gathered on the right side
         so I had a clear way to the teleporter, but for some reason I tried
         to grab the medikit before teleporting. Bad idea -> down to 52% at
         the teleport. The last hill is just luck, I lost 29% health this time
         but sometimes even 100% is not enough... and if you get stuck while
         going up then you're dead for sure.
         
  MAP30: Easy on the first look, but strange things happen sometimes. Arch-viles
         and pain elementals are the main threat, but demons or revenants can
         give you a hard time. My run went OK except that the revenant respawned
         early and I had a spectre chewing my side...
  
  I gotta say thanks for all the people who played NightMare skill throughout the
  years, I used a lot of their routes, ideas and tactics in this run. Special thanks
  for the D2S people, Thomas "Panter" Pilger, Vincent Catalaa and Henning Skogsto
  for their runs, I never could have done this without you folks.
  
  And thank you for watching my run!
