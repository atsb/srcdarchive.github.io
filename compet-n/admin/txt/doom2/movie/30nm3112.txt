Description:

Alrighty then!! :-) Like I said a few hours ago, you never know when I'm back,
could be days\months\years or even hours :). Was hoping here to make it just under
the 31min barrier. As I whatched the replay it became obvious though that I wasn't 
gonna be forgiven with the stupid mistakes in 14(wtf was up with that archie?) 15\18\19 
and 26 again!. 

Generally I like this one alot better. Espessialy happy with 02\07\13\11\13 and most maps 
from 20-29...and oh boy would you look at that ending blast in 30 :-)
