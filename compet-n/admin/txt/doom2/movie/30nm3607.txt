Description: 1year later and 1min and 31sec's faster than my previous 30nm(3738),
             mostly due to route improvments on a few maps. The run is OK I think 
             there weren't any part that went terrible wrong besides from failing 
             a few tricks, still lotsa of those slow parts, like the first 10maps, 
             (only 7sec's improvment) and a few other maps like 13,17,22
             23,25 and 29. 
 
             I will definatly try and do it in 35:xx and do a few things
             diffrently. This will probably be done sometime next year as it 
             would take me quite some "extra" tries. Untill then merry X-mas and
             have a happy new year :)
