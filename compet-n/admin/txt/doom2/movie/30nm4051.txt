  Description:
 
  My second 30nm run. I'm glad I did it, but i'm not happy what it looks
  like. My movements are not good in this movie, probably because it's 
  still the morning and this is my first try today. I made some really
  horrible mistakes (map27) and was very close to death couple of times
  (8% health in map22). I also managed to screw up the last map, I think
  I finished the run at the very last possible moment, there wouldn't have
  been any more chances to do anything there. After all, it's still a 
  valid run and each 30nm counts. ;)
