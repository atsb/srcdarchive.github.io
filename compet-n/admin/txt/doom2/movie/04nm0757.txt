  This time copied my own .TXT ;-)

  Made many, many mistakes in MAP02 (forgot to take the 30% health in the
  middle). I couldn't make up this low health and armour in the following
  maps. Played well in MAP03 and MAP04, except in the last room with the
  chaingunners, maybe I would have been able to get to (my ;-) MAP06, but
  I totally forgot what to do facing the Cacos right at the end. It won't
  take me too long to get through until MAP09 (Ahem - hopefully). So, my
  daily quota is done - every day, a good .LMP :-)

  (Steffen, come on, forget DooM (1) Schwarzenegger, just for one LMP ;-)
