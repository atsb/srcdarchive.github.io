Description: Well I have completed a new Doom2 Lightning and this
             one is a lot faster.
             I don't have the time to comment all the levels, but
             it is possible to complete some of the levels faster
             than I did.
             The reason I completed this .LMP was because "some"
             people thought my old entry (lightn32) was too slow
             and, with this .LMP, I also beat the other 57 mins.
             something entry.

[  Admin. Note :-)  Firstly, these filenames have been changed...
   "4948UV01 --> 30UV4948" [ Levels one to 30 - UV - in: 49" 48 ]

   Secondly, I have _NOT_ reviewed this -Record'ing, and so these
   table values ( And many thanks for providing this data :-) are
   taken as correct. This was done in favour of a "30UV4525" .LMP
   [ same author ] which is a better -Record'ing as the "winning"
   (so far) entry. The only ( ? ;-) important values in this .LMP
   would have been the very BEST time for each of the levels, but
   ( with 30UV4525 :-) none (NOT even ONE) of them would qualify.

   Next. ( "Demonlord" .LMP... :-) And thanks ( ? ;-)
