Description:
My very first 30nm exit, 14 seconds faster than the 6 year old record (30nm2939) by Henning.
30nm2939 is probably the main reason why I run doom today!

This run has a different route for some maps 7,8,10,13,14,16,21 and 22 have the biggest changes,
After many hours of practice with UV difficulty I figured several of the tricks could make the run
both faster and easier to survive. Unlike plutonia on NM I this time have previous NM runs that 
I can learn from, so a lot of the route is trying to copy what Henning does in 30nm2939. 

There were some good maps in here, 6,7,31,16,21,22 
and some straightforward maps like 1,18,19,20.
The rest were pretty much bad or a complete disaster.

Main reason for improvement was the added tricks, but the quality of this run is far below the
previous record. Obviously I can't stop at 29:25, but I'm not the only one running this category,
so we might see someone else improve it soon enough!

Map Description:

Map 2-5: 53 seconds lost, a bit safer strategies, but mostly I'm not good enough to get 
good times on these maps.

Map 7: 36 seconds time save, map isn't even difficult, as long as you don't get
too careless and take all the manc fireballs.

Map 8-10: Overall I lose time, I also take a bigger risk I think, I'll need to re consider this route.
Quite a miracle on map 10, should have died with this health.

Map 14: Completely failed this map, again. Not supposed to be this difficult, 
lost 21 seconds instead of gaining 20.

Map 16,21,22: Include glides here, saves a lot of time, almost a minute.

Map 27: You will not believe the incredible amount of luck I had here.
I usually listen to music while I play, when I do UV there are 2 places where sound
could be useful, like map 15 and 28 switch. However, having too loud music compared to the 
ingame sound will prevent you from hearing the door on map 27 open!!!

I could absolutely not hear a single thing as I was standing in that corner, 
I didn't expect to make it this far anyways really, so I was 100% sure I was going to die
here since getting the arch vile to open the door with this method is the only strategy I have.

So, at some random point, I just went for it... and the door was open!!

Map 28: I was a bit shaken up after map 27, you can tell by how awful I played here, almost died.

Map 29: Failed jump in the end and was really close to dying.

Map 30: I was supposed to stand further back and use the BFG to kill the first 2 spawns I think.
Never had any trouble with reaching the platform in practice, but getting to this map for the first
time on nightmare makes things a bit more difficult :)

Now that first exit is out of the way, I'll go back to thinking about the route.
There's always something that can be done better, for doom 2 uv-speed the first time
I told myself that the route is done there's probably been a 100 changes, some very small
obviously, but for nightmare it's even more complicated. Then hopefully I will be able to 
do a good quality run for this category at some point.
