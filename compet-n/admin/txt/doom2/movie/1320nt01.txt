  Description :-)

  ... Slow - But Good ...

  *ALL* Levels Under PAR!

  But on "Hey, Not Too Rough" Skill Two... so they should be ;-)


             I'm tired of writing descriptions... watch the .LMP

  Level 01 -

  Level 08 - This is one where it all went horribly wrong... the
             CyberDemon teleported early and screwed my plan :-(
             But don't just give up - Fight back on any terms...
             You never know... :-)

  Level 10 -

             And there I Stop, wait 20 sec. and then Hit "Q" :-)


  1013ty01 - "Episode One" - Skill 1 - all in 10 min. 13 sec.
  1320nt01 - "Episode One" - Skill 2 - all in 13 min. 20 sec.
  1621hm01 - "Episode One" - Skill 3 - all in 16 min. 21 sec.

  Next...

  ????uv01 - "Episode One" - Skill 4 - all... if I can ;-) ??


  So, Beat This - Or do "Episode 2" Or maybe "Episode 3" - Or an
  even better demo on a, more acceptable, ie. higher Skill Level
