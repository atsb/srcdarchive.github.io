[  Admin. Note :-)  Anthe asked me to review this "second place"
   NightMare run and upload it if it was good enough - IT IS :-)

   It may even be "better" than Steffen's </all bow> original(!)
   "DOOM2NM.LMP" for version 1.7/a thru' to the very same level.

   ( I dunno. Would someone care to produce a table for that ;-)

   Anyway, I said that there would be *NO* second places (and NO
   Fragging Moaning ;-) This is worth "12 levels" / "2nd. place"
   ie. Six (6) points in the "Nation's Cup" ;-) ME, The "Judge".

   The ONE problem that I had with this .LMP was the lack of any
   wait at the end of LV 06... Anyway, I was able to hack a copy
   of it to produce a "06NM-450.PCX" (enclosed) to determine the
   total time taken. Warning ! - Next time, it gets Auto-DQ'd !
