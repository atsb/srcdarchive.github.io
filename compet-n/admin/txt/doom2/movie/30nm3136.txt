Description:

Phew!!...Okay I know this isn't much of an improvement over Viles previous record run, 
but here comes mine nevertheless :) Thanks to Vile for taking the effort into bringing 
a new standard into the saga of 30nm running with he's 30nm3159!

New things as of this run would be: 

	- Skipped the 200cell-pack\rad-suit in the start of map20 
	- Totaly new route for map28. 

Gotta start beeing abit more carefull with cell usage if you do map20 like this, and be 
sure to not forget the green armor before exiting map18. As for map28, the route cuts of at 
least 25sec over the old one, and comes with minimal risk!. 

I'd wish I could promote this in a "31maps under 31min" kind of way...not sure if thats gonna 
be happening. Still perfectly possible, my screwups where in the maps 06\14\23\25\26\29..but hey
who dosn't do screwups? ...if its not in say map14 it's in some other map the next time and so on. 
Right now I think I'm gonna leave it ...for how long? ..who knows, could be days\months or years :)
