  Description:

  Here's a story. It's a long one, I'm sorry :)

  The first Compet-N demo I ever saw was Panter's first D2S run. Somehow
  I'd found my way to Doomworld, where there was a news item about
  the demo. When I actually got the chance to watch it, I was completely
  taken aback by how fast and furious it was. My first thought was that
  I didn't know you were allowed to play Doom that way; the second was
  that there was no way I'd ever be able to do something like that.

  But I watched some more Compet-N demos, and practised my playing more,
  and about eighteen months later I found myself recording demos
  and submitting them. Steffen "Rini" Udluft suggested to me that I
  might like to play for DANG, and I started sending stuff there too.

  At about this time I was thinking about trying to do some Doom2 nightmare
  demos. On 27-12-1999 I first tried to record an nm run from scratch. Made
  it as far as map04, found that to be as tough as advertised, and left
  it all alone. (Just watched that demo again. Uuuugly.)

  Five months later I was on a big DANG tablefilling binge, and I decided
  to give the nightmare slot another go. After some work I got a demo
  dying on map05 (17-05-2000), then an hour later one dying on map07,
  and finally that day a full Ep1 run. At the end of map10 I hit q
  rather than try and go on, as I had no idea how to play the next set
  of levels. To get around that, I started practising the second episode.
  The first try I have was made on 12-06-2000. Six days later I made
  it.

  At this point I sat back and sort of idly wondered about doing the
  third episode. map22 looked impossible, but I started recording anyway.
  A couple of hours after finishing the second episode, I managed a
  try passing map22. It kept going. Somehow I found myself on map29.
  After some baffled, experimental playing, I made it to the final staircase,
  and died at the top.

  This decided me: I was going to go for the D2S. I started recording
  from scratch again, and five days later I had a run dying on map22.
  (Istvan's keyboard nightmare demos were a big help at this point,
  particularly his two 21nm runs.) Then I tried to get past that point,
  and it was just impossibly hard. Over the next four months I collected
  another four Ep3 runs dying on map29, and made it to map22 again *twice*.
  There were a lot of strange deaths on early maps. The real problem,
  though, was that I just wasn't skilled enough for the task.

  On 26-10-2000, I finally made it past map22, dying on the next map.
  It was a big psychological barrier since I didn't know of any
  keyboarder demos that had gotten to this point. But I was so exhausted
  and frustrated with recording nightmare demos that I immediately
  stopped recording. I didn't try again for six months, and when I
  did all I was able to do was get to map21 (28-06-2001), slower than
  my previous tries, and die there. It all seemed too difficult, and I
  didn't try again for another two years.

  For some reason, in July this year I started again. I didn't think I
  had much chance at doing map29, but I'd always thought I could get
  demo at least running through to map28. I must have gotten better in
  the meantime, because now things went a lot faster. On 22-07-2003,
  I made it past map23 for the first time, dying on map25. A few weeks
  later (19-08-2003), I got my first 28nm. The next day I tried another
  time and again made it to map29. 

  Vincent suggested to me that I should do Ep3 first before trying to get
  a full 30nm. On 09-09-2003 I completed Episode 3. Eleven days later
  I had a try dying on map30.

  That was disheartening, and I didn't record for two weeks. But when I
  eventually came back to the computer, I got this :)

  Obviously a D2S is a much different achievement nowadays compared to 1997,
  or even 2000. It's much easier, for one thing. Hardly something to brag
  about. Still, it's always nice to complete a task you set yourself
  several years beforehand :)


  Map descriptions:

  MAP01: I'm not a mouser, so 0:06 is out of the question. 0:07 is
         very easy to get though. Good health shouldn't be any trouble
         either, though I'm not picky... anything above 70% will get me
         to the next level.
  
  MAP02: I've only recently started playing this one fairly fast - my usual
         times were in the 1:45-1:55 range, but there's no reason to
         play so cautious this early on in the run. A couple of respawns
         and some messiness knock the time outside par.
  
  MAP03: It's a real lottery early on as to how much health you'll
         lose, it's rarely a danger for map04 though. Couldn't make a
         fast exit because the pigs were in my way at the end. Sometimes
         they'll block you, sometimes they won't.
         
  MAP04: This is one of those maps you think is impossible in the beginning,
         but after practise it becomes very easy. No real tricks or
         speeding efforts on this route, just basic nightmare playing.
  
  MAP05: The route I use here is pretty slow, but it worked well enough
         for me and I wasn't impatient enough to try to make it faster :)
         Low health can theoretically do you in, but there shouldn't be
         any surprises here.
         
  MAP06: I can't do most of the fancy jumps on this level, so at
         at the start I take my frustrations out on an innocent group
         of nearby pigs, then get the Spider fighting imps, which distracts
         her long enough for me to take the supercharge and plasma.
         Now I'm set for the rest of the level.
         Later on I take the cell pack, and the end is done the id-intended
         manner. Like all levels to this point, time is average.
         
  MAP07: I love this level. Even when you're losing it's still a blast
         to fire through. One spider respawned this time, but he was
         quickly taken care of.
  
  MAP08: First really bad time of the demo. This is a level that's almost
         impossible to screw up, but I do it easily, first getting trapped
         in the yellow key room, then inexplicably using pistol on a
         demon between me and the BFG. Some bad SSG shots later, the
         invuln's run out and I'm far far away from the exit. Luckily
         there wasn't anything in my way as I ran to the exit.

         Lost maybe 20seconds, all up.

  MAP09: Strategic BFG shots and quick running make this map very easy
         and great to run through. One of my favourites. Unfortunately
         I made a couple of dumb falldowns at the start, lost
         about ten seconds there. The rest goes well up to the
         end, where a Mancubus catches me with an ENORMOUS blast.
         I lost something like 90% health at once....
         
  MAP10: Played a little slower than usual because of low initial health,
         everything goes okay although I use too much cell ammo at the
         end. This variation of the steffen-route was done by Vincent,
         I think, and the extra invuln time makes it almost impossible
         *not* to leave with a full complement of health. If you're wondering
         what the theme behind the routes I've selected is, it's Health
         Maximisation :)
         
  MAP11: This map isn't much of a challenge with all the health from map10.
         The supercharge can be left until you come back with the blue key,
         and from there the standard route shouldn't give you
         any trouble. I'm particularly well off in this demo, exiting with
         164/136 :)

  MAP12: Played the start here a little more cautious, as I wanted to save
         all that nice health for the end room. Said end room isn't too hard
         with the Hungarian route... so that's what I use. Everything is
         fairly standard in this run.
         
  MAP13: Time is fast for this level. Everything should be okay up
         until the yellow key - getting out of that building is
         occasionally tough. But you can pretty much play through in
         your sleep.
         
  MAP14: I thought about taking Istvan's route, but a single mistake
         can leave you stranded. And this way you can keep your cell
         supplies up. Watch out for some bad jumps and bizarre weapons
         changes, though :)
         Also lost a lot more health at the end than usual.
  
  MAP15: Some low health forced a short detour, otherwise things went
         okay. IMO there's no need to bother with the blue armor/radsuit:
         if you've got lots of health you won't need them, and if
         not they cost health to get and you'll be jumping to hit
         the switch so there's no need for the radsuit anyway.
  
  MAP31: Just run and shoot. Excellent map for BFG practice. If I got here
         with no armor I sometimes went for the megasphere.
         
  MAP32: A quick 'Don't Argue' from my trusty SSG and Cybie gets right
         out of the way :) Sometimes strange things happen in the Keen
         room, but not this time.
         
  MAP16: You can sometimes take a big hit before snatching the invuln.
         But as it doesn't matter much what health you take to map17, there's
         no stress.

  MAP17: Stuffed up the jump early on, releasing the cacos. This doesn't
         make the level harder, but it does give proceedings a bit
         more spice :) I use Vince's excellent trick of rocketing the spider
         from above, unfortunately I couldn't hear the game audio at this
         point so I dropped down a bit early... fortunately she was well
         out of the way. Rest went as usual, a long constant battle
         with not many hard points.
         
  MAP18: Yeah I know, wimpiest route ever. What can I say. It's nice to
         have one level you know for a certainty will never kill you,
         and I haven't died here once :)
         
  MAP19: I can't take the Ilya route (keyboarder, etc, you know). But there
         are other ways of finishing this level. I particularly like
         this route, which has a very low probability of surprise and
         no hard tricks in it. Taking the yellow instead of blue key
         is yet another Vince innovation, which gives more time to
         use the invuln. Very easy to leave this level with 200/200.
         
  MAP20: Another recent route change. I used to take the slower route that
         telefrags the first PE, but with so much starting health
         there's no reason for it. The second PE can be difficult,
         so just play that section cautiously. Everything went to plan
         here.
         
  MAP21: DISASTER. I don't like this map in any case - you're always losing
         health and respawns pop up everywhere - but everything was going
         okay, until I missed the red key. And I noticed that I'd missed
         it one second too late, forcing me to run and get it again.
         This meant the invuln would run out before I got to the exit.
         Then I compounded the error by mistiming the platform rise and
         getting hammered by hellknight and imp fireballs. Somehow I
         got my shit together and managed to exit the second time.

         Exit health: 99/101. And I was lucky to have that.

  MAP22: Used to be a big barrier map for me, but now I have better
         than even odds of making it through.
         I was in a tight situation after the adventures of the last
         level, but it's not so important that you have health here
         as long as you keep your armor levels up. Actually this
         level isn't too bad as long as you don't get unexpected
         respawns in the central area or the demons by the red key.
         Luck was with me on this run and neither of these events happened.
         At the red key I use rockets rather than BFG on the central area,
         which I don't think I've seen in any other demo and can
         work really well.

         Lots of practice with FILLUP.WAD really helps you get to grips
         with this level.
         
  MAP23: You really can't relax anywhere on this level, even after getting
         the megasphere you can still run out of ammo or have a respawning
         monster pummeling your back. As happens here...
  
  MAP24: The toughest part of this level is teleporting into a room full
         of hostile lost skulls. I use BFG to clear one side, then plasma
         on the other. SSG takes too long IMO, and it's far from pleasant
         being knocked off the ledges by a skull :)

         Red key area usually goes smoothly, but an awkward respawn
         forced me to waste some cells. Fortunately health stayed high...
         
  MAP25: Much harder than it looks. It's possible to lose lots of health
         very quickly in the central area, through no fault of your own,
         and that revenant must be a specially bred long-range revenant,
         he can hit you from miles away :)

         Start is best played slow, clear enemies out from in front of
         you and use rocket splash damage. Then run and hope for bad aim...
         It worked well this time, exit stats 106/115.
         
  MAP26: DISASTER #2. I hadn't had much trouble with this map up till
         now, but unbeknownst to me Hell had decided to replace a regular
         Baron with a Super-Baron, who took 2 BFG blasts, 2 rockets,
         a SSG blast, and not only stayed upright but managed to severely
         maul me in the process. When you see me switch to pistol you
         know I'm somewhat at a loss :) Then chaingunners respawned,
         the cacos gave me trouble, and shortly I was at 2% health
         running across lava.

         SOMEHOW, I survived. Wasn't sure if I had enough health for the
         yellow key, and it dropped down to 24% again. For some reason
         I wasn't that excited by all this. In fact this whole run up till
         map30 was done in a very calm state. Perhaps that's how I made
         it...
         
  MAP27: Vacation time. Moment of insanity at the chaingunners, but
         I fortunately found the invuln in time.
         
  MAP28: Even easier. You can make up your own route here, this one didn't
         take long to decide on and hasn't failed me yet. You can see I'm
         still having sound difficulties, but they're not of importance
         here.
         
  MAP29: It's tough and you've got to plan ahead. I watched a lot of demos
         and played FILLUP sessions and eventually decided to take Vince's
         way. I made one modification to the route - BFG the hellknights
         and lower the short barrier, this loses some time but makes
         some maneuvers much easier and helps keep the stress levels
         down. Vince's route also calls for leaving the soulsphere to the
         end, but my clumsy hands on the controls made me pick it up
         straight away. Took the cacos out fairly well, but one
         got me from behind as I ran to the first room. On the caco/PE
         room I used a BFG route I hadn't tried before (and what a
         perfect time to experiment, right? :) but it didn't harm me that
         much. Lost more health at the sargeants, and ended up
         going into the final room at 100/115 or thereabouts.

         The final room *looked* like it was going to be hard, but it wasn't.
         There were very few respawns, the cacos stayed away, and there was
         enough health to keep me hovering at 100. BFG on the Barons worked
         well, and as I ran up the final hill I don't think I was even
         worried...

         I've made it to this level four times in a D2S movie. First time
         I died in the last room, second I died on the hill, the third
         and fourth I finished it. Maybe this level's reputation for
         toughness is undeserved...
         
  MAP30: Since dying here on my last attempt, I've had a dread of this level.
         Revenant survived the BFG blast - not good. Rockets took him out,
         but the pulse was starting to rise. I had a PE spawn, but he was
         right in front and easy to take out. Then I go for the first shot.
         Rocket misses and revenant respawns. Pulse rising. But I got the
         radsuit. Kill revenant and go for second shot. A couple of manc
         and rev blasts knock me down to 124%. But rocket goes in! Third
         shot misses, but I jump and this one goes in. Two blasts, one to
         go. I lower the platform, aim, and... it misses. Pulse definitely
         rising now. I take another shot. Revenant respawns. Shot misses.
         Pulse pounding. BFG to clear room, lower platform, steady nerves,
         shoot.

         FATALITY.

         And a cheeky little dance at the end too :)


  And so it's done! And I might be too, at least with Compet-N. I haven't
  been very active of late anyway, and the desire to record competitive
  demos is pretty much gone now.

  But, I'll stick around anyway. Can't leave all these great demos :)

  Some people do deserve thanks at this point. Firstly Adam Hegyi, for
  maintaining Compet-N, and Ralf Schrievogel and Arno Slagboom, for
  maintaining DANG. Istvan Pataki's FILLUP utility was invaluable for
  practice. Of all the D2S demos that have been recorded, Panter's,
  Henning's and Vincent's were of particular inspiration. And I have
  to thank Vincent, Anders, Henning and Radek for their support and
  encouragement as I finally went for it.

  It's been great. Later.
