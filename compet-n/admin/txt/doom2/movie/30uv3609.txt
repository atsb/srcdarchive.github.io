  Description:  A few things about the levels:

                Level  2: Very hard when speeding through...

                Level  4: Very satisfied wtih the time.

                Level  5: Time's real good, because I always play
                          full screen, I didn't know how close to
                          dying I was here......

                Level  8: This IS a disaster, think I had 0:39 in my
                          old 30UV- recording... However, it's very
                          easy to get stuck or fall down when running
                          the ledges to the exit door.

                Level 24: I'll never be a Steffen runner...

                Level 27: Pretty satisfied with this one, a lot of
                          things that can go wrong...

                Level 28: Should have used BFG at the Archvile scene.

                Level 29: Felt good...

                Level 30: Hmmm... I never seem to get any better at
                          this.


                This is probably my last 30UV- recording don't think
                it's possible to push it much more without cheatin'.
