C-N entry #34, movie run #8.

This run was the first time I successfully got past map24.. and the remaining levels
went well enough, surprisingly.  Things went a little sour on map30 (check out the
first shot I take on the brain.. the revenant respawns right when I fire :). I'm
thinking about practicing these levels further before I attempt the 30ns, but we'll see.
If I get a faster time, I'll upload it.

Well, either way, it looks like I could start trying for it anytime now.  A big thanks
goes to Henning for his movie runs/routes, they were a tremendous help and very
entertaining. :)
