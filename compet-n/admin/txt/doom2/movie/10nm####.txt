[ Admin. Note :-(  This is the closest I've come to DisQualifying an
  entry. Demonlord simply does not wait at the Status Screens - this
  makes getting any times (or generating a table) out of this almost
  impossible - However, since it is Such a Good NightMare! Run... it
  will pass, Not as a Timed 10LVs entry but, as a DooM II Movie.
