   Description: About the levels:

                Level 21: Quite good.

                Level 22: Rather good, hard level.

                Level 23: Not perfect, couple of sec.

                Level 24: I hate this one, those bloody ledges.

                Level 25: OK.

                Level 26: Time's OK.

                Level 27: Can push this one a lot... And die...

                Level 28: Well...

                Level 29: Quite good, had some mistakes though.

                Level 30: Not perfect, but rather good.


   Finally:     I think that this 10 level run is the
                hardest of 'em all, almost drives me mad...
