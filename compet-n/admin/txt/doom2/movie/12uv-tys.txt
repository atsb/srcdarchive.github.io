Description: 

  Well since Anders already did the max-doom thingy, I had to come up with
  something new...so I wondered...how about a 32-level speedrun of Doom2
  using TYSON WEAPONS only?  Of course, there's a problem...Map 07.
  No mere mortal can complete that level on Tyson.  Well Demonlord did it,
  but I'm talking about regular human beings here...

  So my solution?  Easy...just "skip" it. :)  Presumably, any Tyson run would
  have to break from Tyson style on the last level anyway, so my proposal
  is allowing the player 3-4 "free passes" to finish a level, or part of a
  level, using other than Tyson weapons, if for no other reason than to
  save boredom on the part of the viewer. :)  I also "skipped" the end of
  map12 because that room was just too damn hard.

  Anyways...here's the first 12 levels done tyson style, with the above
  exceptions.  I'm not much of a Tyson player -- does it show?? -- so maybe
  it will inspire one of the Tyson masters to take over from here.

  Some comments on the levels:

Map 01:  Easy, of course. :P  Good idea to stock up on ammo here.

Map 02:  Pretty much have to kill everything.  Only real tricky part is
         the tunnels area.  This is one of my best runs of this level.

Map 03:  A chainsaw party! :)  Lots of health make it easy.  I did screw
         up the end real bad.

Map 04:  Similar to map02 but not quite as hard.  I meant to do Panter's
         "pacifist" ending, but missed the jump...

Map 05:  Most fun of the levels.  Just run through it.  The chainies do
         make the end kinda dicey. :-)))

Map 06:  Undoubtedly my worst performance of this level, ever.  Well I
         guess it proves that it's almost impossible to die here!  Easy.

Map 07:  Yeah, I'll punch out 8 mancubi & 12 arachnotrons!  NOT!!!

Map 08:  Trickier than expected, getting trapped is a big danger.  That
         cyberdemon was NOT gonna let me pass...

Map 09:  I'm sure a Tyson Master could do the yellow key area a lot faster?
         No real problems if you're careful, though.

Map 10:  Get the berzerk, soulsphere & invisibility without getting stuck,
         and it's a piece of cake. :)

Map 11:  Not terribly hard, but becomes lethal if something goes wrong!

Map 12:  First half is easy enough.  Second half is impossible.  I tried
         using pistol on the cacos but those three in the middle always
         came through the door, and with half a million arachnoids outside
         there was no place to run...getting the blue sphere only gave me
         an extra 1 or 2 seconds, maybe.  Finally I gave up and switched
         to rockets/plasma -- take THAT you fat one-eyed beasties!!!

Map 13:  Well, I never practiced this level until making this demo...the
         first part was easy, as expected, but at the yellow key room...
         *sigh*

I haven't seriously looked at the remaining levels but here are my
predictions:

14 - hard!
15, 31, 32 - easy
16 - easy if you can reach the invuln?
17 - VERY hard!!
18 - easy!
19, 20 - easy(?)
21, 22, 23 - hard(?)
24, 25 - easy(?)
26 - VERY hard, maybe impossible?
27, 28 - easy!
29 - VERY hard, maybe impossible?
30 - depends on spawns...will need to use RL anyway
