Description: Ahh...for the first time ever here it is :) (and yes I'm proud to say this) 
	     2 months ago I said that this was impossible and that it was highly unlikely that anyone would 
	     ever get past map15. 

             Well I was ofcourse wrong, and was blown away when I realized that Vincent and Chris did all the 
             episodes with seeminly little difficulties. I just couldn't belive it, I sat down and 
             whatched their demos and I was soon to realize that with the tactics and routes they showed 
             there a 30ns should be within reach with not too much effort. Finaly I could re-use some of the 
             the things I had learned during all those 30nm sessions :) 

             Finaly on to some personal thoughts about this demo itself....well me and Anders predicted that 
             a 30ns would be between 60 - 70min, so the total time isn't that off, but still this could have been
	     done alot faster, that I know but I was really nervous and had to calm down my blood preasure before getting 
	     into the final battels of map29 and 30 :) Had some mental support from the guys at ircnet #nightmare so thx
	     guys :) From time to time I was panic playing but these things happen, but I don't mind as long as I made 
	     it. I know Vincent is also working on this same thing, last thing I heard was that he had already reached map24
             in a rather unserious try so good luck Vincent :-) 
	
             Alright, you should have betting things to do than reading this so cyas...
