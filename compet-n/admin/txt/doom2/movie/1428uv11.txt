  Description: This recording is about 1:30 faster than my
               old entry at 15:52.

               Level 11 is average.
               Level 12 is very good, especially the end,
                        taking no damage at all.
               Level 13 missed the...... jump.
               Level 14 quite ok.
               Level 15 ok.
               Level 31 and 32, too easy.
               Level 16 monsters got in the way all the time...
               Level 17 is rather good.
               Level 18 ok.
               Level 19 alright.
               Level 20 I know I probably could have left the Sphere.
