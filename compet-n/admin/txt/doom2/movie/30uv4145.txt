Description: A few things about the levels:

             Level 02: I don't like this one, easy to die...

             Level 04: Also hard when "speeding".

             Level 09: A fall at the end, about 5 sec.

             Level 31: Changed weapon to plasma, because I
                       thought it was too close...

             Level 22: Could be pushed by about 10 sec, easy
                       to die though.

             Level 23: Should never have taken the backpacks
                       at the beginning, things like this are
                       often the result of when you play with
                       full screen... time could be pushed by
                       about 15 sec.

             Level 26: Time is very good.

             Level 27: This one isn't good at all, it could have
                       been done about 25 sec. faster. The faster
                       way demands alot of plasma though I only
                       had about 100. Also very easy to die when
                       playing the faster way.

             Level 30: This level is really strange - the skull
                       on the stick takes 4 hits before dying !
                       I thought it was over when I got the 3 one
                       you can see that I'm running away from it all
                       after the 3 hit..then returning back, lost
                       about 13 sec. on this "mistake", "bug" ??
