30FANET1.LMP - Ultra-Violence + 100% Kills & Secrets + -fast monsters + Net1

This is a Compet-N/Doom2/MOVIE...((:

Recorded using Doom2 Version 1.9
Ipxsetup -Nodes 1 -PlayDemo with Version 1.9

Description :

	That's something very funny to do... the coop bonus big dudes add a lot 
        to the fun. Besides that it's faster than my 30fanet1 (w/o fake coop).     
        From 01 to 12 i know the routes... then it's pretty chaotic :).

	I attached a BAT file to launch the demo, but u'll need IPX to play it.
        Fro those who don't have IPX, Adam told me that there is a tool that 
        emulates IPX in FDGMDEMO.Zip located in TeamTNT/finaldoom on Cdrom.com.

	Credits to Adam Hegyi for checking the times and alive monsters
        with his not yet released latest Timer. Here is the table 
        he produced with it (i changed nothing).
