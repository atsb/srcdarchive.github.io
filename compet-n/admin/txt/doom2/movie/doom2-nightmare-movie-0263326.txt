Description:
My 3rd exit for 30nm, 1:01 faster than the previous record.

The goal was to get under 25 minutes, so I wasn't too bothered 
by the bad luck on map 29 and 30. Of course both those time 
losses could have been avoided at the cost of some few seconds, 
but you never know when a few seconds might be too much.

Actually I still could have gotten under 25 when I started 
map 29, but I would have to take the most aggressive strategy
and everything would have to go perfect, maybe 1 in a 1000 chance. 
If I knew how the time was looking after map 25 I would have done 
things a bit different, but I thought it was a bit slower.

Perhaps I should start trying to keep track of the time like I did 
for 30uv, but all the way up to the later maps so I know what kind of
risks I need to take.


Few comments about some of the maps:

I think I lose more time than I save without making things any easier by
grabbing the rockets on map 5 and skipping the megasphere on map 6, 
I should look into that for future attempts.

I thought my map 08 in 01nm0659 was bad, I have no idea how that 
baron kept denying me those rockets, never seen anything like it.

Map 9 and 19 were better than any time I've ever had in practice (by 1 second)

Map 10 I needed to grab the 25 health.

Map 15 I usually always get the PE kill, if not I sometimes grab the YK
even if he is alive, this time neither happened so I get a bad time.

Map 20 is a really dumb mistake, I usually never fail this jump with my setup.
I should be more careful next time.

Map 23, first demo to ever show this completely new trick! 
(well, it's just a linedef skip) and it's the only trick I have ever discovered :)

I run forward, stop, walk forward, turn left and then use straferun50 to
skip the linedef that opens the wall for the mancubus and do the barrel wallrun.

The linedef skip was accidently discovered during 30uv practice, which is
surprising since afaik I need to first move forward and I have to be at a very
precise spot for this to work. So because I use vertical mouse movement I would
sometimes turn around and also move away from the direction I want to move, which
would cost me a few tics in 30uv, but then I somehow just skipped the linedef.

It wasn't until I started 30nm again that I looked into it, and at first I was 
thinking I must have been imagining things because I could not replicate it, or
used noclip. Then eventually I did manage to do it, and I noticed that I needed
an extremely precise position, impossible to do consistent if I even have my hand 
on the mouse. By simply trial and error I found a setup that worked eventually.

Of course a linedef skip (when you run south direction) isn't something hard to do, 
but it was not obvious it could be done with such a small distance from the linedef itself.

Recently I noticed Xepop did something similar in nm20-039, and it's a bit easier
to do on that map, which could be nice for the 200 cells + rad suit, unfortunately 
the imp attacks too quickly for there to be any chance of getting in consistently.
Then again it would be hard to save the time lost with the 200 cells, so doesn't really matter.

Map 29 and 30, a different RNG index could have prevented that shotgunner respawn,
pain elemental spawn, or the seeker missile from the revenant, which would likely
have meant a better time, though of course I could have gotten arch-vile on 3rd spawn...
