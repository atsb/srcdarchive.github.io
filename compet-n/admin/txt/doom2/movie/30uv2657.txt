C-N entry #152, movie run #31.

I spent more time on this one than I have for most of my movies, regardless of
my overall opinion about doom2 maps.  This one was especially fun for some reason
so I kept at it.  Breaking the 29 minute barrier was my first surprise, so you
can only imagine how I felt about 28 and 27.  Anyways, I've done well over 10 of
these damn things by now, so I hope the end result is enjoyable!  On to comments:

lv01: I always get 6-7 here, but I restart for 6 out of spite if I get 7.  Never
      got a 5 here.. yet.

lv02: A good time, my best being :44 if I remember right.  I used to die here a
      lot, now only occasionally if I mess up the dark rooms near the blue key.

lv03: Got hung up at the chaingun, otherwise no problems.

lv04: Missed the end jumps but recovered fast and got one of my usual times.  My
      best here is :34!

lv05: Can't complain, this is my average time.  Sometimes I got as low as :27.

lv06: I started messing up the first jump for no reason lately, but not this time.
      I did something silly and fell off at the end before even trying the end jump,
      but recovered fast again.  Time is good. :)

lv07: I used to be terrible at this map, so I'm pleased with times under 1 minute.
      I believe my best here was :52, and my next time up was :56, so it was damn
      rare.

lv08: A luck run, as they say, and my luck was fine here. :)

lv09: Could have been better or worse, so I'm not unhappy with the time.  I use the
      speed route here for the end.

lv10: I don't take Henning's route here (which only saves around 5 seconds if the
      cyber doesn't kill you).  The extra cells in the cyber room are helpful many
      levels from now, anyway.

lv11: Ohh, under 1 minute, this was rare.  Happy happy, joy joy.

lv12: Meh, not bad, but not that good, my best time here was :50.  It all depends on
      how the end platforms want to react.

lv13: Not bad.  My first impressions of the blue key jump were that it was difficult,
      but I tried it and nailed it everytime, hehe.  Silly me... I also had a rare
      problem near the end (actually, this was the first time) where the monsters
      really tried to keep me from getting away from the yellow key building, so I
      had to circle around a bit.

lv14: No missed jumps, great time here. :))  I also got to see the archvile launch a
      trooper into air gibs for a brief instant.

lv15: No complaints, getting stuck at the yellow key is common.

lv31: Sieg Heil, mein Furher.  No Grosse anymore, sorry. :)

lv16: The only disadvantage of skipping map32 is no megasphere, so I snag the invuln.

lv17: An ok time, would have been closer to 2 mins if I hadn't messed up the archvile
      room, but I got a soulsphere for my troubles.

lv18: An easy level for potion fillups!

lv19: About as fast as I get here, no problems.

lv20: Very low health at one point, but nothing serious.  Great time.

lv21: I took a slight detour for some extra insurance (medikits) before playing the
      yellow key game with the imps.

lv22: A lot of cells makes this one easy, and a healthy exit is nice for the early
      parts of map23.

lv23: No problems here, and under 1 minute was rare, so yippie!  Actually, I died
      sometimes at two areas if I was unlucky.  Sneaking between the spider boss
      and the arachs didn't go so well sometimes, and even less lucky was getting
      blocked by the archvile and being pounded before I can even react.  I keep
      the BFG ready for both areas now. :)

lv24: I used to hate this level because of the ledges (must have fallen off in the
      skull room +5 times).  Under 1 minute is just fine by me...

lv25: My fastest time ever here, an interesting development.  I didn't execute the
      bulk cell grab at the end, which was a shame, but I had enough cells. :)

lv26: Another great time here, lots of cells means little danger.

lv27: I had told myself (and discussed it with ocelot) that the archvile trick at
      the red door would be my trump card if the run was going worse than usual,
      and my success rate isn't that great with it.  I didn't this time because of
      some good times earlier, so I wanted to play it out normally.  Under 1 minute
      was a surprise for me, though. :)

lv28: I got rocked by an archvile at the end, it serves me right for hitting the use
      key and not having the door open.  I also tried something sneaky by using st50
      to try and dash over the linedef that releases the archviles (near the spiders)
      and then I could grab the megasphere uninhibited.  SHAME ON ME.

lv29: I really wanted to have a time under 2 minutes for my uploaded run, and here it
      is.  I got jumped by the archvile and had to climb the stairs again, but I made
      up for it with interest by executing the FJS jump in one try.  As of late it was
      taking me up to 3 tries, so I was happy to see 1:5x again, hehe.

lv30: I used to have problems with this map, but I got the strafe jump to catch the
      elevator and also used Doomgeek's elevator-lowering technique to get a sub
      1-min time.  No complaints, dammit.

All in all, I didn't expect to get 26:5x without an effort which included the map27
trick, so I'm pleased with the result.  There were some slightly slower times than
in ep1 usual but the rest of the run turned out pretty good.  Perhaps this is the
last minute barrier to be broken in this run, but who knows what may end up in
incoming one day... ;)
