Description: This is my first run thru 1-10 in ns. I had a few attempts at it some time ago. 
	     But I was too lazy to figure out a solid route thru the maps 8-10. 
	     So thanks to Chris for showing me a trustable way of doing it. 

	     Was kinda suprised to see a keyboarder doing this for the first time at compet-n, 
	     excelent work Chris :-)

	     Alright, gonna try the maps 11 thru 20 now. And then 21-30 :D
	     Perhaps we'll see a 30ns in a few months ? :)
