Total 34:13   
     -------

Description: Lots of those big fuckups, this was actually supposed to be a warmup session.
             I had never tried to skip map32 before so I didn't know exacly know how it would
             all turn out in the later maps with less health\ammo. I also tried a couple of new
             and faster routes in maps like 11,20,22 and 28. I was supposed to be following 
             another route in map13 as well but like I said this was more like a test session. 
		
	     I assume that with these new routes\tactics the total time can without too much 
             work come down to 32min at least. We're getting closer to the 29:24uv record time 
             at least :)
