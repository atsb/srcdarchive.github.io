  Description :-)

  Just overflew Daniel's times from his Ep2 DooM II Run and took
  the new record time yesterday. I said to myself "A time around
  13:30 should be possible" and that's true. I just got a little
  unlucky in this recording. Map14 & 15 are way too slow. 11, 19
  and 20 should also be faster. But I am *SURE*, Daniel recorded
  it while I was writing this text ;-) ...

[  Admin. Note ;-)  Well, a little before you wrote your text...

   This is just 06 seconds off the pace but four of these levels
   were done with the fastest times so far - Have 4 points ! :-)
