Description: This .lmp is dedicated to Adam and ESPECIALLY Istvan...both had
             some great ideas, tips and tricks for 22 & 23...I followed
             Istvan's detailed map 22 route pixelperfect...and got out with
             about 130% ((((:
             23 was a piece of cake with THAT amount of health...ok..you can
             smell how nervous I was in the end of it...hehe..
             I wasn't prepared for 24 so I died there VERY silly...but again
             ...this .lmp is (hopefully) just an update...so I don't want to
             write here that much...

             2 more BAD news...

             1. I'm 9sec away from Dl's episode1-nm-record...):

             2. There's a 15min pause after map15...A friend come over here
                and so I couldn't play...(with -timedemo the pause took 2min
                (p166).. consequently you shouldn't watch it w/o...maybe it's
                possible to delete some waits...?)
