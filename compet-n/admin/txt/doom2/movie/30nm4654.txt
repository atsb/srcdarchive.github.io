  Description:
  
  I'm really excited that I finally finished the run. My first 30nm tries
  were back in year 2000. I reached map11 and that was my maximum in that 
  time. I haven't worked on it since then, but I still had the idea in 
  my head. About two weeks ago I decided to go for it. There was nothing
  better to play in c-n anyway. I obviously started with watching some 
  NM runs, studying routes and practising. Quite easily reached map12,
  later map14 and map22. The next day I reached map29 for the first time,
  I was really nervous and died. The next day I play from morning till
  night and got to map29 twice, but also died twice. It was very 
  disappointing for me, but I knew I could do it. So I took one day break
  and didn't play at all. Then I played again and reached map30! One
  damn rocket to the brain and it was over, I was already staying on 
  the lift but something hit me from back and I died again. It was like
  a shock, I couldn't belive, I felt like smashing all the comp and 
  crying at the same time. I didn't give it up, a few days later this
  nice baby was birth. It was very bloody. I can't count how many times
  I died, but I think it goes to hundreds :) I died nearly in every map,
  mostly map07/map22/23, also map26 and map29. I must say this demo
  is kinda a copy of Adam Hegyi's one, I used 99% of his routes and 
  tactics, just compare my and his times. :) Of course, this is not
  my last 30nm for sure...
  

  Map descriptions:

  MAP01: 8 seconds suck, but I don't really care.
  
  MAP02: I don't like the dark part of the map, cuz I don't see anything
         on my screen and usually screw it up there. This time an Imp got
         me stuck and took me some seconds which ended up being 2s over
         par time.
  
  MAP03: Not as easy as it looks, chaingunners can give you the real hell
         sometimes.

  MAP04: I played the end a very safe way, when I have enough health I just
         do the exit jumps.
  
  MAP05: I made a mistake at the end and fell down, fortunately the pigs 
         didn't eat me.
         
  MAP06: I can the the first jump just once of five tries (never practised
         it), so I do it a save way. I made another mistake and fell to 
         the slime, really horrible to watch. 
         
         
  MAP07: The first map I'm really satisfied with. A cool run I think and 
         even could have been below 1min. Pity not always it goes like this,
         sometimes it's like a neverending story.
  
  MAP08: Easy.

  MAP09: Yeah, BFG is a very helpful weapon here.      
        
  MAP10: I don't like this map on NM, especially the end part. I mean, when
         Cybie is staying in front of the exit and shooting rockets all 
         the time. It happened at least 5 times to me.
         
  MAP11: I used to die here a lot, but with Adam's tactic it's not so hard.

  MAP12: The last room went nearly perfect. 

  MAP13: Two Invuls make the map easy. It would be much harder without them
         I guess.
         
  MAP14: This is kinda a plasma madness. I'm always happy when I finish the
         map, no matter what time I get. At first I was trying the window 
         jump near the exit, but after a few deaths I realized it's much
         saver to go the normal way.
         
  MAP15: I rarely skip the blue armor, cuz I'm mostly low health after 
         map14.
  
  MAP31/32: Easy.
        
  MAP16: I wasted one shot more in the Archie room.
         
  MAP17: Easy to screw up the whole run. I took Doomgeek's route here, 
         cuz I think it's saver. Once or twice I tried the shortcut with 
         jump to the yellow key, but didn't feel good without invisibility 
         later.
         
  MAP18: Nice and easy to finish with 200/100.
         
  MAP19: I prefer going for the yellow key instead of the blue one. 
         Sometimes pigs blocked me right under the window on the way to
         the exit which is damn annoying.

  MAP20: Oh, stupid me, I missed Megasphere, didn't know what to do for
         a few seconds, then realized there's another secret room there.
 
  MAP21: Just getting ready for the hell.
        
  MAP22: Damn, I was nervous here. I thought I was dead when I did an early 
         shot while staying on the lift. Somehow managed to survive, then 
         again a few unwanted BFG shots that nearly cost me my life. But 
         at the end I had 50/50, not too much, but still better than rebirth 
         in map01. ;)
         
  MAP23: At the start, the street of truth, very easy to die, especially 
         when you have low health after map22. I killed all Knights, cuz it's
         not very pleasant to get any slime to your face right after you 
         teleport to the room again. Couple of times I missed Megasphere on
         the first attempt, so I went for another one, it's possible but
         cost you from 80 to 120 cells that are needed in map25. Btw. once
         I survived the map even when I had just 3% health at the start. 
         (but just once :)

  MAP24: Didn't fall down, so an Ok run.
         
  MAP25: The central room with revenant on the lookout is a pain sometimes. 
         I didn't feel guilty for wasting 2 BFG shots, more important is to 
         have enough health for the next map.
        
  MAP26: I don't like this map at all. Damn annoying chaingunners are 
         everywhere.
         
  MAP27: Grabbing cells in the Archie room is kinda risky, cuz if you get 
         stuck for a while and the door closed, you have to waste lot of ammo
         to get out of there, and also run out of Invul. Fortuntely that 
         doesn't happen very often.       

  MAP28: I never have problem with this map. Finishing 200/200 is easy 
         and neccessary, of course.
          
  MAP29: Oh..there is one word that describes this map indeed -> hell! 
         I had about 5mins break after map28, tried to calm down a bit 
         and stop my hands shaking. The start went fine, didn't loose much
         health. I always want Knight to loose about 80% of his health, 
         then I finish him from upstairs, that helps to avoid an early respawn.
         This time I was kinda lucky in that part, cuz lonely Caco flew to the
         teleport, otherwise I would've killed it by BFG. Then I grabbed some 
         health, maybe could've saved it, but I killed all Cacos with no harm.
         I don't like running on the raising platform, so I stayed right at
         the wall. The next room went perfect I have to say. Saved blue 
         armor on the way back and also managed to clean up the room with 
         just 2 BFG shots what is cool. In practising I tried to kill PE by 
         plasma and then use BFG, but usually some Cacos were annoying me
         from behind, so I left that tactic. The archie room went fine too. 
         I still had a lot of health for the hardest place on the map. 
         I shot 2 BFGs while entering the Revenant room, but lost 60% health
         anyway. Then the middle switch followed by the right one. The jump 
         is not hard, but those two barons can be deadly, I died on that 
         place 2 times, cuz I wanted to hurry up when heard the sound of
         respawn revenant. Once I died on the hill, althought I had 90% 
         health after the teleport. You can never be sure, you will finish it.       
 
  MAP30: I got quite nervous when I didn't kill the revenant, cuz I wanted to 
         do a jump on the raising lift. Nevermind, I got that bastard later 
         from short distance. It seemed everything's going well, I was just 
         praying not to see Archie or PE. But what happened then ??? WHAT
         THE HELL WAS THAT ??? Count with me....yeah..5 rockets to the brain!!
         Have you ever seen anything like that ?? Me definitely not. I couldn't
         belive, I knew I needed just one rocket to the brain (supposed to 
         be the third one, the last one), that's why I didn't jump down to 
         get the Megasphere, the same with the fourth rocket. My health was 
         going down quick, and revenant appeared up there again, fortunately 
         the fifth rocket ended the whole run....
         

  Now I have to thanks to you all, for reading, watching, playing DooM and
  thinking it's the best game ever. Special thanks to Adam Hegyi for his demo,
  Istvan Pataki for his FILLUP.WAD (we all would have been lost without that) 
  and all D2S guys out there.

  ENJOY!
