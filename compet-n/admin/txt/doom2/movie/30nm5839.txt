  Description:
  
  I'm quite glad to have done this, even though the time isn't very good by
  today's standards. I wanted to do a "safe" 30nm to get comfortable with the
  maps; maybe eventually I will try to produce a competitive 30nm with quicker
  routes.
  
  I started playing nightmare in early 1996, after seeing a e1nm and a 12nm,
  both by Steffen Winterfeldt. I thought they were great runs, and I was
  particularly impressed by his style, which involved a lot of walking and
  regular shotgun.
  
  Of course, back then I was mostly into deathmatch, and nobody I knew really
  cared about single-player. Nonetheless, I thought nightmare play could help
  improve my movement and aim, so I gave it a shot. After a while, I managed a
  e1nm of my own (I deleted the lmp a long time ago, hehe), and a 13nm (I had
  access to Winterfeldt's 30nm6520 by then, and was following his routes).
  
  Then I stopped playing doom altogether for roughly 5 years. I started again
  in late 2001, and figured I should get back to nightmare play. I got to map14
  again after a while.
  
  More recently, I reached map15 for the first time (this was on 2002-02-16).
  That motivated me, and I started studying the maps/routes more seriously, and
  using FILLUP.WAD. The next time I tried a run from scratch, I got to map22
  (2002-02-27). I made it to map23 later the same day, and after a few more
  tries I reached map29 twice (2002-03-02).
  
  I talked a bit with Andy and Henning about map29, and various things were
  suggested... I watched Panter's, Vince's, and Adam's 30nm runs to study the
  map29 handling. After a while I decided that this route was safest for me,
  and practiced it a lot.
  
  Now I got this run. This time I pressed alt-tab after map28, to relax for a
  few minutes, and to visualize the map29 route. I got lucky and both map29
  and map30 were pretty much a breeze - I did fall in the archvile room in
  map29, but no harm was done.
  
  Naturally, stuff went wrong in my first successful 30nm. I was even slower
  than planned in episode 1, and in map13 I thought for sure I was dead (see
  below for details). I can't really complain though, because map29 went easy
  on me. :)
  

  Map comments:

  MAP01: I take the armor to have an easier time in map02. Safety first. ;)
         The imps in the armor room were refusing to cooperate this time. The
         chainsaw is convenient to have for the last imp, and so you don't
         pick it up in map28.
  
  MAP02: Quite easy with the armor from map01.
  
  MAP03: Very easy.
         <sarcasm> You can see my brilliant ssg at the exit room. </sarcasm>
         
  MAP04: Easy if you exit map03 with lots of health/armor.
  
  MAP05: Sometimes you can lose health quickly in the exit room. :/
         
  MAP06: Sorry for the long wait at the plasma gun (I like to have it to get
         the megasphere just before exiting). I tried some fancy shit with
         the lift when taking the plasma gun, but failed miserably. :) Not
         a big deal though. I also managed to miss the jump in the red key
         room - that's something to be proud of.
         
  MAP07: This system is pretty consistent. I take all the invisibilities
         early on and let them wear off while I run around firing ssg. That
         way the arach fire is more predictable because I'm not invisible,
         I can dodge without worrying about picking up a damn invis, and I
         save some rockets/cells. I couldn't seem to hit the switches this
         time.
  
  MAP08: I used to go do something else while the cyber and barons fought,
         but once I was met by a lost rocket when I came back. So now I stay
         there and wait. Usually I get 1:30 or so because the fight doesn't
         last this long.
         
  MAP09: Routine; got to be careful in the yellow key room though.
         
  MAP10: Hurray for Winterfeldt's route here.
         
  MAP11: Quite easy with all the health/armor from map10. If you're not
         careful, the archvile can get fancy and whack you as you go down
         the stairs.
         
  MAP12: The exit room is difficult. Nice projectile dodging practice, hehe.
         
  MAP13: I had a fine plan here: clear the monsters near the blue door, and
         leave the invul outside for later, to take the sphere before
         exiting. I fell in the blue door room though, and got down to 7%.
         I was about to press 'q', because I had to teleport to the red key
         and those imps without the invul. Then I got this idea with BFG,
         and it worked. I took the invul outside immediately because of low
         health, and never got to take the supercharge. Oh well. :)
         
  MAP14: I used more cells than usual here to preserve my health. The way I
         rush into the archvile room is safer than it looks, and then it's
         quieter while I do the blue key room.
  
  MAP15: Because of abnormal cell usage in maps 13 and 14, I couldn't use
         BFG at the blue armor/rad suit spot, at the invul, or at the
         yellow key without awakening the monsters. Thus this map took a
         bit longer than usual (usually 1:00 or so). After I exited, I was
         back on track with the plan though.
  
  MAP31: Not a problem with over 100% armor from map15.
         
  MAP32: First pit stop.
         
  MAP16: Got to be quick to exit before the invul wears off.
         
  MAP17: Easy when you take the sphere and invis just before doing the
         last area, and fire a few BFG shots when entering it.
         
  MAP18: I didn't even bother trying the invul grab, hehe.
         
  MAP19: About the only trick that made it into my run. After that it's
         easy, but there's no time to waste.
         
  MAP20: I go all the way up there at the start to telefrag the pain
         elemental. Then I'm left alone while I kill the other one.
         
  MAP21: Damn teleporter bug. Was on my way to a 200/200 exit. :\
         
  MAP22: Entering with a little less health isn't a big deal... Exiting
         with high health/armor is what matters. I messed up my BFG timing
         when leaving the red key room. I also fumbled a bit with the exit
         switch. I usually exit in better shape than this.
         
  MAP23: It's good to have lots of cells here. That way you can use plasma
         on the barrels from afar on the pain elemental ledge; use BFG on
         the revenant/archvile group; etc. They hurt me a lot this time,
         but I didn't really mind, as long as I killed them fairly quickly.
         I didn't want them to respawn in my back.
  
  MAP24: My route is really boring, but I exit with close to 200/200 almost
         every time, even if I enter with close to 0/0. The caco at the
         backpack was annoying throughout: respawned early, and then hid to
         the right of the ledge when I was coming back with invul. I find
         this map a lot easier without -record, because of the finer mouse
         control.
         
  MAP25: Not so bad if you enter with high health/armor. Exiting with >50
         health is all you can ask for, in my opinion. You get two medikits
         at the beginning of map26 anyway.
         
  MAP26: This one is a bit difficult. I unexpectedly ran out of BFG shots
         for the baron at the yellow key. Luckily he didn't get in the way.
         
  MAP27: That was the second time the teleporter to blue door didn't work
         in a 30nm attempt. This time I was prepared. :)
         
  MAP28: Second pit stop.
         
  MAP29: This is certainly the most difficult map of the whole run. I'm
         pretty satisfied with the route, and with how things turned out
         during the actual run. I used to kill the cacos with BFG from the
         switch ledge, avoiding the sphere to save it for the last room.
         This proved too difficult to do in an actual 30nm though (I found
         out in my first 28nm), so I killed them with rockets from below
         instead. When stuff teleports in from the other ledge, I just
         move away and kill it without changing weapons. There are lots of
         medikits in that area anyway.
         
         I left the blue armor and the sphere for as late as I could,
         spamming BFG to get to the sphere safely. Then I'm sure the caco
         thought he was being funny when he blocked the last doorway. :P
         The baron was a team player and tagged along with some more
         "funny" stuff that came close to hitting me. I passed through
         pretty much unharmed though.
         
         The last room is a true challenge. Killing the last two barons
         from the lava worked great though. I was pretty confident of
         exiting after that, having lots of health/armor.
         
  MAP30: Went really well.
  
  
  Acknowledgements, and stuff:
  
  I plagiar... I mean, analyzed as many routes as I could from other
  players. I studied Winterfeldt, Henning and Vince the most. Special
  thanks to Henning and Andy for some cool suggestions and for being so
  damn positive all the time. Also thanks to everyone who said it could
  be cool to see a 30nm from me, or just supported me in my endeavor.
  And also thanks to the #nightmare people, and the whole single-player
  community, who keep raising the bar in terms of demo quality.
  
  If you've read this far, thank you, too. :)
  
  Finally, thanks to Xenos for getting me back into Doom in late 2001.
  Be well, man.
