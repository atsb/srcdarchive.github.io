Description:
More warmup for 30nm, this episode is easier than ep1, 
but I did make some pretty bad mistakes in previous attempts.
At least they showed up here instead during 30nm attempts, 
still some things I need to figure out. Map 17 turns out to 
be very difficult during single segment instead of practice.


Map 11: A quick look at 1119nm11 by vile and I just copied that here.
The start is complete luck based, but it doesn't take too long before 
you reach the soulsphere. 

Map 12: In a previous attempt I took some 100+ damage through the 
wall at YK, followed up by the shotgunners it was impossible to survive. 
I've gotten really good at the cacodemon room now, I am not too affraid 
of it anymore. Somehow I managed to lose 2 seconds trying to go to the exit.

Map 13: Really bad time, I am lacking some cells from ep1 so 
I don't BFG the revenants like I did in 30uv1959, but I will probably
copy that since they hit me so often.

Map 14: This map should not be difficult anymore, but I had some
trouble with the wallrun trick again in previous attempt. I usually
always get 24 seconds on this map, so not a good time.

Map 15: Took a lot of damage before I jump down to the switch,
but then I got lucky. 

Map 31: Low on armor, so I used some rockets which costs a second or two.
Very lucky with the damage taken this time.

Map 16: Shouldn't take a revenant hit like that.

Map 17: After grabbing the blue key I always seem to get in trouble, 
everything is fine once I reach the elevator though. Terrible time.

I was down to 1% health, and then got lucky by not having the chaingunner 
in position to kill me when I try to hit the switch. I also assumed I 
would have plenty of plasma left over for map 19\20, that was a small mistake.

Map 18: I skip the invurnability now, I do grab the soulsphere still. 
There's an ok chance you can make it with without the soulsphere, 
but I would rather not risk it for a couple of seconds.

Map 19: This map is easy, I was not to happy with my plasma ammo near the end,
so I switched to rockets which cost some time. I also forgot I didn't have SSG,
I wasn't sure if the tip of the shotgun was in the same location as the SSG. 
Which is why I was a bit slow with the glide. Terrible time.

Map 20: This map is not too hard, much easier for episode 2 only since
I don't need to avoid taking damage in the last room.
