  Description :-)

  In the last .TXT I said under 13 mins. would be a nice performance, but
  now I know it's possible under 12:00 (Yes !) - Look at MAP08+MAP09 8-(.
  MAP04-06 and MAP10 are wonderful - rest is ok. So, let's see if anybody
  beats this. Now I'm training for "DooM II Episode II". It's much harder
  to play it fast - Next, I think I'll try to [ prove "Hunter" Hoof wrong
  again and ] go for DooM (1) Incubus.
