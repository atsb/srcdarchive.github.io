C-N entry #201, movie run #35.

Hey, there's finally a third 30ns for the boards, so I can
stop getting credit for 3rd place with that silly episode run.
I'd like to first give mad props to the two guys who made this
run a reality, Henning Skogsto and Vincent "PerOxyd" Catalaa, as
well as those who successfully proved that the individual
episodes were possible.  Great work guys! :)

This is only my second ever 30nm (the first successful
30nm was another 30ns attempt that ended up having a missed
secret on map10... the total time was slower).  As such, I
don't mind a lot of the mistakes that occurred in this run,
even though most of them would have really pissed me off
normally (I like the yellow key jump on map17... you can tell).
It seemed like a backwards run, where a lot of the easy stuff
gave me trouble and the hard stuff gave me a break.  Anyway,
overall I'm not very satisfied with this run, despite some of
the good fortune received in maps like 22 and 30, but I need
a break from this crap presently, so who knows if I'll ever
come back.  With more experience put in, who knows how low
the time will go.
