C-N entry #32, movie run #6.

My practice for a 30ns begins with these first 10 levels.  My thoughts on the levels
themselves?  Well, the first 6 levels are actually kinda boring, but I like maps 7-10
a bit more.  I've had better attempts, but I believe I know the first 10 levels well
enough to move forward (plus Dashiva said I should move on, and he's always right :).

I'm sure Henning will wish to improve upon this run while I move on to the next 2
episodes, and no doubt he will, since he has played these levels a lot more than
myself.  The only major difference in the route is map09, where I play less safe
in one particular area.  So good luck to him with this one.  In the end, it's you
loyal c-n viewers who benefit the most. :)
