  Comments:

  It seems to me that there is room for vast improvement on
  levels 5, 6, and 9 still.  If I ever make another recording
  of this episode, I'll try to do better on those 3.

  There is a brief pause during level 2 (phone call) which
  only results in me taking fireball dammage... :)

  I guess I lied about not competing in this category again...
  It can be addicting, but I don't know why because I really
  do detest winning a level and leaving stuff alive.

[  Admin. Note :-) First of all, thanks for providing your own Table

   - I've checked it through and it's perfect :-) Second, if you try
   to improve your times for LV's 02, 05 and 06 (09 is K00l ;-) then
   you will have a "Lightning" Episode... though I personally do not
   believe LV 06 Under Par is possible - it's hard enough on HMP ;-)
   Somebody proove me wrong! Lastly, *IF* you ever get a real e-mail
   address... I'd like a friendly chat or two - I've got some thanks
   to thrown your way :-) Apology time... This is the 2nd. time that
   I've re-uploaded this .LMP - the 1st. one had that Level 02 pause
   "hacked" out of it but the demo still got out of synch - on Level
   06 (?) Very strange... Pause re-inserted. Sorry about the repack-
   ing cock-up, the .LMP wasn't "bad" (it's really way too good ;-),
   it was my fault ;-( Sorry ;-) And Really Finally...

   One Star -Record-ing... and with a "Bronze Medal" as a Reward :-)
