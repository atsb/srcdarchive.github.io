  02CR2328.LMP - Limited weapons multi-level speedrun
                 using only weapon 1&&5

  Recorded using Doom2 Version 1.9
  Doom2 -PlayDemo with Version 1.9

  Description: What's the weakest combination of weapons that still is
               sufficient to do all DOOM/DOOM2 episodes?
               Yes it's (C)hainsaw/fist && (R)ocketlauncher. This is a very
               nice combination imo.
               This shows episode 2 of DOOM2, which is really fun to play.
               I recommend to try this. If this is too easy for you,
               go ahead and record UDOOM episode 4.
               In some maps which are impossible (or extremely hard) in
               pacifist style, the CR style is fun for single level
               recordings too.

               Some comments on the levels:

               Level 11: The most challenging map in this run, and great
                         fun too.

               Level 12: The rocketlauncher makes things easy.
                       
               Level 13: I take the chainsaw and collect lots of rockets.
                         Besides this I telefrag the mancubus - just for
                         fun.

               Level 14: Uups got a rocket in the face here.

               Level 15: Taking the secret exit and running out of rockets.
             
               Level 31: Just run through.
             
               Level 32: Don't like to waste rockets here.
            
               Level 16: Got hit by the archvile again.
                       
               Level 17: This is much easier than expected -
                         as long as you safe three rockets for the last
                         spider ...
                       
               Level 18: See why we need weapon 1 too?

               Level 19: This can be tricky, if you get trapped
                         by the spectres. That's why I open the main exit
                         first. Some rockets are missing at the red key
                         spider though.
                       
               Level 20: No big difference to normal gameplay.
