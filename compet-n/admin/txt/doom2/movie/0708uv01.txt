Description :-)

Hmmm I am no good at this episode, still I managed to snatch the
record with some playing.... At least I had this record once
in my life.... I'm VERY upset about my performance on MAP07...
damn arachnos...

I hope the next challenger will beat 7 minutes now... He should :)

Anyway seeing that there are serious 01-10 runners here unlike me,
how about 6:30 Panter, Henning?
