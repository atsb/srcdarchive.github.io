  COOPUV30.LMP - Ultra Violence - 2 Players - Cooperative !


[  Admin. Notes :-)

   [ Copied from 30UVNET2.TXT - It is such a very similar story... ]

   First of all this Recording takes over _TWO_HOURS_ to -PlayDemo !

   Because it is so long you may have trouble getting Doom2 to start
   but if you only have a total of 8 Mb of RAM, it will NOT all load
   load into the -PlayDemo buffer, though you CAN still watch levels
   COOP1-XX _IF_ you can somehow split this .LMP at offset 2,083,957 *
   and add an end-of-game byte (decimal 128 - 80 hex), such that the
   .LMP is 2,083,958 bytes long...

   [ * plus or minus (+/-) X * 8 bytes (for however many gametics) ]

   Don't forget this end-of-game byte "€" or else your savegames may
   get overwritten if a -PlayDemo misses one and crashes at the very
   end... You have been warned.

     Copy /B SplitLMP.LMP + €  COOP1-XX.LMP  [ Del SplitLMP.LMP ]

   Also if you think that a co-operative recording of Doom2 would be
   boring to watch [ OKay it is a bit, to begin with ] then you have
   obviously not tried it... You can only pick up a Rocket-Launcher,
   Plasma Rifle, BFG9000 or Super Shotgun ONCE - unless you die - it
   is difficult NOT to frag each other AND there are MORE bigger and
   badder .NET monseters on maps 11, 12, 13... 15... 17... 19, 20...
   We're talking CyberDemon "cross-fire" here !

   If you do not really want to watch the initial, ten or so, levels
   but would like to see some of the later better levels - you could
   start the .LMP from the beginning (the only way), and go away for
   a while... eat something, watch some TV ( not much difference ;-)
   or whatever... then return [ ~30 minutes ] for the later action !

   Finally, if you want to "beat" this [ as if ] I would like to see
   it done FASTER - miss out all of the the non-vital areas - and do
   not ALL get killed on a level as simple as 24 ? ;-) But remember:
   -*> NO Respawning <*- !!! - If (or when) you die, you stay DEAD !

   Really lastly, the/my prefered table format is to be found in the
   file "07UVNET2.TXT" though all the stats given here are even more
   detailed so they've been left as they were/are :-)


   Well done to Demonlord and Stefan too !

The percent value is (Ep-run single/Our) a measurement of "how effective"
the coop really is (should, if optimal, be 200!) compared to best single
player time starting with pistol only... And also "100/100" episode runs
for a single player...

Overall  01-32    137:36    135:38  122:17   111   Tried as good as possible
                                                   but without a good plan
                                                   at each level...


Final Comments:     We tried to beat Kai and Sven's "Coop1-30" and
                    we made it about 20 minutes faster...

                    The Cyberdemons are really hard and especially
                    the ones at levels 17, 26 and 29 are VERY hard
                    Think the time could quite easily be pushed to
                    around 1.40-1.50 (?). This is however our best
                    attempt so far...

                    Never thought co-op could be that much fun !
