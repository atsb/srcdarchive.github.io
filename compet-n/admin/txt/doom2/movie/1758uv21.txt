  Description :

  After my full 32 level recording it doesn't make much sense to record
  "only one episode!. But the time goes by and I found some better ways
  to complete some of the maps - It is much easier to practise just ten
  maps than the full 32.


  Some remarks on the recording (mostly self-criticism):

  21 (nirvana):
    I run too fast towards a dead machine gun dude so I get his machine gun
    before the last gunner is dead. This costs me the weapon change time.
    Directly afterwards a hell knight blocks my way. A very rare case.

  23 (barrels o'fun):
    A variant: don't get all the rockets behind the imps. Stepping in - out
    is enough to open the door to the spiders. But I need the rockets...

  24 (the chasm):
    I fight against the skulls only with my super shotgun. Maybe I should
    try another weapon (195/195 -> 102/105 in a 10 seconds).
    At the end I run into the side of the red door. Stupid mistake.

  27 (monster condo):
    I'm not sure if it was necessary to kill all the revenants around the red
    key. Only I'm there with invulnerability.

  29 (the living end):
    I miss an imp on the stairs and the arch-vile.

  30 (icon of sin):
    At the end I intentionally commit suicide. The game ends as usual,
    the ending screen says something about "begin the long trek back home";
    what a very strange behaviour.


  I dedicate this recording to the guys from id software who 2 years ago
  gave us this wonderful piece of software for a complete waste of time.
