Description: Finaly I managed to accomplish this last big challange in doom2
             at least..:)) Now that I have gained more practice at epis3 
             I think I would have quit good chances in bringing a future 
             30nm run below the magic 40min barrier...but I really can-t 
             say for sure whetever I-ll be abel to do it again, or if so 
             bringing it below 40min....
