  Description :-)

  I just wanted to prove to myself if I could do this 'Super-Lightning'
  title. When you look carefully at the 'best-time-ever-got' table you
  will notice that this .LMP could be much faster, however, I had to
  fight all the .LMP long, especially the last two maps were my coffin
  nail (pons spoke ;-) I lost sth like 30 secs compared to other runs.
  Maps 02 - 07 were OK, times are pretty good. I often had very close
  situations like for example in map 07 being down on 1 % health. That
  was also a reason for me to upload this .LMP, because I think that
  such .LMP's are much more fun and exciting to watch. Also there are
  enough perfect .LMP's out there ;-).
