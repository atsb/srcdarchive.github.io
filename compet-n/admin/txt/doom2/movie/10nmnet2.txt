 Description:

 Level 02: Nice coop, this way it's really easy.

 Level 04: Green collecting the keys, while Indigo makes some cover action.

 Level 05: The invulnerability makes extremly easy, no cooperation needed,
           the exit room can be tricky...

 Level 06: Nice coop, some role changing in red key room (green had too many
           energy :) ) it cost some seconds.

 Level 07: It's rather easy...

 Level 08: Another single player level, too much invulns.

 Level 09: It's a good place to cooperate, and we really use this chance.

 Level 11: Sorry but we were not prepared for this one :)
           At the begining we tried to discus the plan, but the cyberdaemon
           doesn't want to cooperate with us, he stands in the way :(

 This lmp is a result of a 3 days practice, but we keep on working, soon we
 do the remaining levels too :)

 Hope you like it!


 Green: Istvan Pataki   <deity@balu.sch.bme.hu>

[  Admin. Note :-) Yes, love it ! Note that although you make this look
   rather easy it is a *lot* harder than it looks. Thanks for providing
   your own table data... If anyone wants to beat this they must get as
   far as level 12 and remember NO respawning - If you get fragged, you
   must let your buddy/ies finish the level and may rejoin at the start
   of the next level, without any big weapons.

   So how many points is this worth... easy 1 point each for each level
   completed - so that's 10 points each... until this gets beaten.
