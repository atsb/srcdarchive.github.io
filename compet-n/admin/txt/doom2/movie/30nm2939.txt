   ...and total time  29:39 
		     -------	  

Description: 

Some new routes and tactics this time around, I was however hoping for a better 
total time. Something like closer to 29min. Sub 29min is gonna be very hard but definatly within reach I think. 

Some big screwups in map06, and 30. The inclusion of FJS jump in 29 did compensate abit but still. 

This is however my first successful run under 30min so I'm satisfied to just get it done I guess :) 
I remember starting doing 30nm runs in late '99, getting a total time of 40:48 in year 2000. 
So 10min over a 10year period :-) 

I might find the motivation to give this a few more goes, who knows. Its really hard
to consentrate to the degree needed in all maps and not make any time consuming mistakes. 
I don't think I will ever get a run I'm fully satisfied with as there will always be screwups 
in various spots. I do however usualy play alot better in maps like 4,5,6 and 9 which is the 
most annoying thing on my mind right now :-) 

Anyhow, it was fun doing a doom comeback, its been like 5years since I played it seriously. I had to spend a considrable amount of time to get back into it though...the rustyness was unbelivable when I started in early january. 
So around 7 almost 8 months to get this, good thing I didn't knew :)  

Hope you enjoy whatching it and feel less frustration over it than I felt in the proccess 
of making it :)
