Description :-)

A minute and a half improvement over the old record....
Simply happy...

Under 10 minutes would be quite tough I guess, in this
run I was very lucky on certain maps, the main improvement
comes on 17, 39 seconds faster than Henning, still there
is room for improvement there. Most of the maps came very good,
so I guess you'll need route changes to beat this by 20-30
seconds. But I hope it won't be too easy :)
