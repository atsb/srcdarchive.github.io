Description: About the levels:

             Level 11 Is in my opinion rather easy, and if it hadn't
             been for the ...... pain elemental just below the platform
             (in the room with the caco-demons near the end) it would
             have been a rather nice level...I think this is one of the
             levels you have to be rather satisfied with the time, though
             it could probably have been about 15-20 seconds better.

             Level 12 Not much to say really, not perfect but I'm satisfied.

             Level 13 This level is probably the hardest of 'em all.

             Level 14 Rather an easy level if you plan it well.

             Level 15 A bloody disaster! I've done this level in 47 seconds
             starting with pistol...

             Level 31 Just run and run...

             Level 32 Just run and shoot rockets...

             Level 16 One of my favourite single player levels, a lot
             of monsters. Could be done faster, about 20 seconds.

             Level 17 Should have used more plasma on this level...
             I think 1 minute could be cut...

             Level 18 Just run and run...and shoot BFG.

             Level 19 I can't understand the door-button thing on this level
             it never seem to work for me, should have been 20 seconds faster

             Level 20 Too slow, could have been about 30 seconds faster.

             Overall I think that Episode 1-10 is much harder to complete.
