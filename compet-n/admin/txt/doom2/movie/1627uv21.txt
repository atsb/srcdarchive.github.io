Description: About the levels:

             Level 21: Time isn't good at all...

             Level 22: Rather good, hard level.

             Level 23: Cool level, time's good

             Level 24: I hate this one, those bloody ledges.

             Level 25: Quite OK.

             Level 26: Time can be pushed, easy to die though.

             Level 27: Time's good, I guess.

             Level 28: Time's shit, I know!

             Level 29: Rather good.

             Level 30: Better than my last entry, still not
                       completely satisfying.

Finally:     I think that this 10 level run is the hardest of
             them all, though 01-10 can make you crazy too...
