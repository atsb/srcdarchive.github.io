Description :-)

A new way to torture... hrm... challenge yourself.
For those who think 30nm is easy. Personally I think a 10ns
run would be great (maps 08-10 aren't easy), but there must be
people who already think of 30ns. Go for it folks!

Highlights in this LMP: MAP07. I hit the exit switch *DEAD*.
