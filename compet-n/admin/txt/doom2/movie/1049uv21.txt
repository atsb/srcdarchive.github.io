Description: Well, this is just a small improvement over Jaromir's run. (17sec)
             I'm sure he will do alot faster run than this one anyway.   

             My main problem is that I can't make the archie at map27 to open
             the exit door for me, so the only solution I could come up with 
             then was to go and get the red key by myself :) I will try to 
             avoid that acrhie trick as long as possible, hopefully other 
             players will do the same thing :p
