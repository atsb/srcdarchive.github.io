Description: About the levels:

             This is a frustrating task...

             Level 01 is good, not perfect though.

             Level 02 is alright...

             Level 03 is not as fast as it should be.

             Level 04 is quite ok.

             Level 05 can be done faster, but it is also
                      very easy to die here...

             Level 06 is rather good.

             Level 07 can be done faster, but...

             Level 08 this time can be about 7 sec. better
                      with "perfect play".

             Level 09 ok, except for the "wait at the skull
                      trigger" lost about 3 sec. there...

             Level 10 is good, wouldn't have been this good
                      if I hadn't left the BFG.
