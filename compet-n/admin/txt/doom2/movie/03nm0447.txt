  This .LMP is played with a horrible style, but it's 7 o'clock in
  the morning and I just got my (first) Internet account. I'm just
  waiting for an answer from ... "somebody"  [ Done already - S. ]

  Each single level is $"!&%! [ What's that ? ] played, so come on
  you guys and get into the NightMare !
