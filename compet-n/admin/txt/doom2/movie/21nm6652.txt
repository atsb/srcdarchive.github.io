  Description:  Finally I did it !

                This is probably the greatest .LMP I  have ever
                recorded. There are a lot of things that can go
                wrong when playing NightMare, and it often did.
                At one point it almost drove me mad, you are so
                close all the time but one single mistake is
                enough to take you down...

                At this very moment while I'm typing this, my
                keyboard, or what's left of it (after all my
                NightMare tries) isn't working very well, eight
                keys are missing from the last time I used it.

                Keyboards are cheap though...


                Some comments about the levels...

  Level 01:     Not much to say, everyone can do it...

  Level 02:     This one isn't easy at all, a few mistakes and you're
                dead.

  Level 03:     Quite simple if you plan it well. A lot of health makes
                it easier.

  Level 04:     This one isn't a favorite of mine, little health and
                a lot of guys with guns makes this level very hard.

  Level 05:     This level is very easy if you take it slow...

  Level 06:     This is also a very easy level, especially when using
                the new trick at the renevents. Thanks Anthe for this !

                The "new" finish is also great, taking the key without
                opening for all the monsters makes the end very nice and
                peaceful. Kai-Uwe should have credit for the "exit-jump".

  Level 07:     Easy level, not in this .LMP though

  Level 08:     Imortal all through the level, gotta plan it well.
                Thanks Steffen and Anthe.

  Level 09:     This one is much harder without the BFG...

  Level 10:     The "Steffen route" is great and you always finish up
                with at least 150/150.

  Level 11:     This level is easy, though without a good plan it's very
                hard.

  Level 12:     The end is very hard I never seem to get any better at
                this either...

  Level 13:     Very easy level with the new route, probably easier then
                level 01 - Kai-Uwe, the credit goes to you !

  Level 14:     Hard at first sight, but if you plan it well this level
                is quite easy.

  Level 15:     This level is average, and a miss at the "button-jump"
                can sometimes be fatal...

  Level 31:     Piece of cake.

  Level 32:     Same as above, no comment.

  Level 16:     In this level I tried to kill the archvile before taking
                the blue key and then the invunarability, this way you
                don't have to use the BFG to get the Sphere and you can
                hereby save some plasma.

  Level 17:     Lots of tricks helped me through this one, this level is
                probably one of the hardest levels in NightMare mode.
                Sorry Anthe, I figured out all the tricks by myself...

  Level 18:     Just run through. Imortal all of the time.

  Level 19:     An easy level, a big mistake could probably kill you.

  Level 20:     This route is perfect for NightMare, this is a very easy
                level because there is a lot of health, the end is a bit
                caotic though.

  Level 21:     Quite easy, harder than 19 and 20 though...

  Level 22:     The reason you never see me "go down" and die is because
                I'm trying to lower the elevator at the same time I die
                (space button), so I reappear at the start immediately
                after dying.

                [ Except I have "fixed" this - maybe I shouldn't have ]

                Is it possible to finish this one at NightMare ?!?

                I don't think so...

                Additional credits to:

                Steffen Winterfeldt, the legend who made NightMare
                playable ! Without his -Record'ings I would never
                have pushed myself this far......
