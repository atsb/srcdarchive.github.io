  Description: 

          Map 11:
          Quite good, considering that I had to go upwards twice with one 
          of the lifts at the end of the map. Had 1:35 in one try.

          Map 12:
          Really hard in this lmp, sometimes it can go very easy, 
	    the timing was bad and I was unlucky with the respawning in the
          Caco room, very close, I sacrify the par time for fetching the SSG
          which I need for the demons on map13..
	
          Map 13: No problems, pretty good time.. I keep the soulsphere
          as a reserve if something should go wrong.. 

          Map 14:
          I never fail here. Although, in this recording I actually had 
          some problems in the first part of the map. In all my practising 
          and recordings I have only died here once..

          Map 15:
          I took the green armour just in case.. Can be tricky without 
          armour, I died here in an earlier try!

          Map 31 & 32:
          Easy as always..;-)
          
          Map 16: 
          Everything went as planned, except that I wasted too much plasma
          that could have been handy for map17..            
          
          Map 17:
          Whoa! The fight of my life! A lot went wrong.. First I 
          timed the first bfg shot wrong and went from approx 185% health
          to 120-125%. Secondly: I opened for the Cacos and Dudes in the
          blue key area by triggering that hidden part. After that I had not 
          great expectations of survival. I managed to sneak through and it
          became one helluva fight..

          Map 18: 
	    Relaxed a bit and played it safe..
          
          Map 19: 
          Thanks to Istvan´s route, this map is now quite easy,
          I wanted the mega-armour but almost screwed up..
          
          Map 20: 
          I died here in an earlier try so I didn´t want to take any 
          chances, normally one of the easiest maps of all, not hard
          this time either ..

     
          Credits to the usual gang, but especially for this run: Andi,
          Istvan and Yonatan. Andi and Istvan for providing solutions
          to some technique problems I had, and even recording special
          lmps for me, Yonatan for telling me to keep a low profile at 
          the exit of map16 and not stir up the imp army and also providing
          Hell Revealed, a nightmarish wad that gave me the self-confidence
          to start with nightmare for real.. I also strongly recommend all 
          lmps by the mentioned players, plus the ones by Kai and Daniel 
          as well..

          I had really wanted to do this as a superlightning but some maps
          were too hard to do under par (12 for instance)..
