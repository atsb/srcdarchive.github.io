Description: Oh well...this came quit easy, pure luck I guss. 
             Anyway...this movie ain't all that good, I lost quit some time
             in the opening maps :(( (11,12,) Apart from that there should 
             be more time to gain at 17,19 and 20.

             Doing this was ment to be a nice paractice for my D2s exam :)
             I can't afford doing more foolich mistakes in epis2. But now I
             really gotta pratice that epis3. The main problem there is
             29. I have already died there twice in my 30nm runs....
             Anyway I hope I will defeat that sucker next time.
