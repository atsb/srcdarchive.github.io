Description:  Well, I'm very happy to get this :) I was trying hard
              last August, inspired by Adam Hegyi's 07ns, and three times
              got to map09, but couldn't get past. It all seemed too much
              trouble, and I gave up.

              Last week I started playing some D2 nm100s for Dang, and I
              thought about this again. After coming up with some different
              routes for 08 and 10, I was able to make it through these
              maps regularly on fillup sessions. So I sat down to record
              for real... and half an hour later had this. It was pretty
              simple in the end...

        LV01: This level is just annoying. I just try to save my health and
              kill everything.

        LV02: No change. One of my better times...

        LV03: No change. Fell off a ledge, losing health for 04.

        LV04: It gets harder, the crucial point is the SSG secret, make it
              out of that and you're fine. The time would have been better
              but a spectre wanted to play hide and seek...

        LV05: Full route credits to Adam Hegyi. The end can get hectic...

        LV06: The secrets aren't any trouble here.

        LV07: Mancubus part went terrible, arachnotron part went great.
              Had lots of health, but you don't need much for 08.

        LV08: There are two crucial points. Making it to the BFG (but that's
              just timing) and after leaving the PE room: if the door isn't
              opened before the invuln runs out, you're in trouble. Otherwise,
              this is very easy, and I usually made it in fillup sessions.
              But strange things can happen here...

        LV09: The BFG secret is a bitch to get. Getting out can be even
              tougher sometimes: here I have to wait for the ledge to stop
              going up and down. After that it gets easier. You better kill
              all the PEs or you'll have trouble at the end.

        LV10: Came up with this route when I was trying to get a ns10, and
              it takes all the stress out of recording this level. It's
              very important to use all the health available. The end was a
              bit close: usually I make it out with a lot more health. This
              route had a 90% chance of success in fillup sessions...
