  Description:  A few things about the levels:


                Level 02: I don't like this one, easy to die...

                Level 04: Time's not good, haven't played this
                          one for a while..

                Level 12: Time's not good.

                Level 13: Time can be pushed a lot but it's
                          quite easy to die or get stuck..

                Level 17: Well, it's a disaster. I fell down...

                Level 24: I still hate those ...... ledges.

                Level 27: Can be pushed a lot, but it's too easy
                          to die... and you need a lot of plasma.

                Level 29: The bloody Archvile... Standing in my
                          way all the time!

                Level 30: Hard to make this one fast...

[  Admin. Note :-)  Thanks for creating your own table - mildly
   inaccurate values corrected [ LV04 was not 00.57 ] and thus:
   filename changed "30UV3844 --> 30UV3853" - Great Run !!! :-)
