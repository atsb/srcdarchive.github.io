Description: About the levels:

             Level 21: My best time ever.

             Level 22: Pretty good time.

             Level 23: Good time.

             Level 24: You can push this one a lot but you can
                       also fall down...

             Level 25: Rather good time, I got stuck at some
                       places though.

             Level 26: Time can be pushed, this level is hard
                       though.

             Level 27: This one is a total disaster, time can
                       be about 17 sec. better...

             Level 28: Time isn't that good, those bloody
                       triggers.

             Level 29: Time is very good.

             Level 30: A total disaster as usual, gotta practice
                       this one.
