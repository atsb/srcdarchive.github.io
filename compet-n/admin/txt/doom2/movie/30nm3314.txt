C-N entry #202, movie run #36.

Hello again.  I've sorta been trying this one off and
on ever since I did the 30ns (with a few attempts at
that inbetween) although some newer games also grabbed
my attention when I got tired of trying.  I had some
issues with the Z_Malloc error recently so I had to
switch off winamp while playing this... you guessed it,
a very quiet run.  Craptacular.

Anyway, this one didn't turn out too bad.  There was
a couple annoying mistakes, such as the end of map06,
and a big one that I wasn't even ready for (the end of
map11... props to the respawning sodomites).  I had
a faster run going earlier but it got smacked down at
the end of map29 due to a cacodemon who planted his ass
right on the path up the final mountain, which was a
real downer, but also didn't result in as much anxiety
when recording a slightly slower run, so I'll take it.
I hope you enjoy the appetizer before Henning comes
back and reminds us all how this run is supposed to be
played. ;)
