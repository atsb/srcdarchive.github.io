  Description: I think the 10 level recordings with 100/100 are
               one of the hardest things there is to record...


               Level 21: Hmmm...

               Level 22: Very easy level and fun to play in 100/100...

               Level 23: Messed up the scene with the Mastermind a bit.

               Level 24: I'm beginning to love those ledges... Not!
                         Rather easy level in 100/100 because there
                         aren't too many monsters to "control".

               Level 25: Fun level but could anyone e-mail me about the
                         shotgun guy who appears when I'm about to open
                         the blue door. I just can't understand where
                         he was hiding, I thought I checked everything.
                         However he "uses" to appear from nowhere so I
                         rechecked the area...

               Level 26: Can be pretty tough, lots of Cacos...

               Level 27: I got the last secret !!!

               Level 28: Without a good plan it's quite a tough level.

               Level 29: I hate the Cyber at the end he IS very hard.

               Level 30: Hmmm... Could of course have been faster.

[  Admin. Note :-)  This kind of entry is NOT the kind of thing I was
   looking for, as missing a monster or a secret would make the whole
   .LMP "invalid", but if that's what you players want to play for...

   So be it ! To beat this entry you must score more kills(!) or more
   secrets(!) (not possible) OR go FASTER _without_missing_anything_!

   Also, since this is so long and DanielL has supplied his own table
   of data - Thanks DanielL - I'll just believe the overall time that
   he claims especially because he didn't miss any monster or secret.

   Oh, how many points does this score --> FIVE ! [ For now ;-) ]
