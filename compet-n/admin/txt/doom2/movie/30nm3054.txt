C-N entry #204, movie run #38.

It's been some quiet sessions without sound... I
got tired of listening to the same George Carlin
Special mp3s so I made some wavs of Seinfeld eps
and used them... weird, but eh, I needed some new
background noise.

Anyway, I was kinda reluctant to upload this because
of my overall disatisfaction, especially with that
bittersweet map30 time (got distracted when I saw
the revenant was STILL alive when I went for the st50
jump, expecting to get knocked down anyway).  I'm
going to put this off for some days and concentrate
on school work.  A few things of note first:

Thanks to Henning for his excellent runs and some new
route ideas, I took a cue from him on map13 (the blue
key jump route didn't seem to produce any gains here)
and the map28 route which isn't too bad at all.  Some
misc stuff include the fact that I've had a higher
success rate with the map04/map06 jumps recently, as
well as broken the annoying map19 glide down to a
science.  I can pull it off fairly easily now, instead
of wiggling the mouse for a whole minute before it lets
me through.  Also, I'm done trying to do the map18 invuln
grab, it's gone when I play.  Anyway, it's late... I need
some fucking sleep.  Enjoy. :)
