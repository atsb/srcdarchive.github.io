Description: This is a frustrating task... I had to strike back...

             About the levels:

             Level  1:  Well not much to say...
             Level  2:  Time's rather good.
             Level  3:  A disaster, should be around 0:40.
             Level  4:  Not that good.
             Level  5:  Not very good either...
             Level  6:  This is tricky, I never thought it would
                        be possible to make it this way in 1-10
                        speeding, it's very hard.
             Level  7:  Time's rather good.
             Level  8:  Also not good at all...
             Level  9:  Time's average.
             Level 10:  Maybe 1 or 2 sec...

             Hopefully my last 1-10 entry...
