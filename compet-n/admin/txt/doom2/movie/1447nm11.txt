  Description : Well, finally to try something longer. It wasn't that hard
                couse I already played this before 2 weeks. Then I did around
                17" but I wasn't satisfied with that demo. Then I used Panter's
                routes but this time I decide to do this in a new way.
                Really I couldn't play this carefully, this is only an episode
                run. When the time for whole thing come then I will change
                few things. This is the easiest episode I think but really
                fun to play, soon I will try others.
