                         PANTER TV PROUDLY PRESENTS

Description: I did this 10 maps so often...I really can't count it anymore
             I collected over 20 nm>21.lmps...7 dying in 29 (last room)
             but...
             I never beat this nm01.lmp by DL...

             The main reason was map 8 in which I always took BFG (because I
             wanted to go further of course) -> loosing 30s. just in that map.
            
             Here I just use Dl's route in map8 and...dadaa...beat him by over
             a minute.
             This is my first successful attempt...so <10min should be
             reachable.


Level 01: Yeah...(:

Level 02: Looks a bit slow but time is quite nice...

Level 03: Uhh....forgot that Chaingun...

Level 04: Some problems but time is still ok.

Level 05: Not much to say...

Level 06: Problems at the beginning/exit jump

Level 07: Bad tactic but good time (:

Level 08: Slow because I though I should take some rocketboxes.

Level 09: I never reached that map before (for nm01 :) time is surprisingly
          superb.

Level 10: Hmmm.....never tried seriously to kill the demons with plasma...
          So I was a bit afraid and took this one very slow.
            

I NEED a good route through that last room in 29 if you want to see some more
