  Well, after beating ep2 I was still in good mood to try this. I know 
  Henna was fighting over this with my clan-mate Jaromir a few years ago,
  so this is a kind of revenge. :))  Anyway, I'm not very happy about 
  the demo, there's still loads of room for improvement. I was pretty
  angry I didn't make the jump in map30, at least it was still enough 
  to make the new episode record. Expect some faster one from me
  soon tho.
