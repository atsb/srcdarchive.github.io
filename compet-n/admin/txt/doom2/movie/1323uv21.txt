Description: Panter TV proudly presents....1 min & 4 sec. improvement to DL's
             time.
             Wow...this one was REALLY hard (took me about 10hours on 2 days)

             You just can't say "Well, all Compet-N single level times together
             are 9 min (8:57 to be exact :)...so DL's 14 min run is not good"
             He played VERY safe and so his time IS good.

             I thought...70% of all Episode 3 .lmps are mine...So I should give
             it a try.


             Level 21: Hmmmmm....I did the 0:45 while trying for this...(more
             or less it's a mistake (:
             But 51 is very good if you use the route with the Megasphere.

             Level 22: Really hard map...time is very good, too...

             Level 23: Even the jump worked sometimes...but this time I tried
             to do it w/o...Time is O.K.

             Level 24: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!...The most difficult Map in this
             Episode...I HATE IT !...time is excellent, compared to my normal
             time here...but this can be improved a lot. (We're talking about
             Movies...not Single Level times :)

             Level 25: Not much to say...A bit slow with a big mistake in the
             end.

             Level 26: Time is OK...

             Level 27: I have never tried this route before...worst time of all
             but you just can't do a 0:13 run here...

             Level 28: Time is quite nice, although I completely forgot my
             normal route in here...(I was really confused at the yellow key)

             Level 29: Hm...some mistakes in the end and very low health...but
             still 17 sec. better than DL...so...time is OK (:

             Level 30: To use Anthe's words..."my hands were wet and i felt
             terrible. i was sure that I would miss the first shot,"
             Hehe...using the press-fire-all-the-time-strategy is no good idea
             when missing the "slow" lift...(:
             But I still can't believe what happened in my third try...In my
             whole life (maybe a bit exaggerated :) I've never hit the brain
             twice...the second shot always misses.
