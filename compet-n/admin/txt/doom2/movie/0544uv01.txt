  Description:
  Now I have actually something to say, since I worked so much for the uv30. This is a failed
  UV30 run. Rest of the run is cut (thanks dew). I'm not really satisfied with this because
  route is from UV30 and not much risks taken. You might see a better run from me in the future.

  lv01: Hmm, I admit that 5second is hard but I got it 4 times in a row :)

  lv02: My personal record is 43seconds with the same tactic, so easy to improve
	with more risky attitude.

  lv03: I remember grinding the jump so many times that I did it 25 times in a row.
        That was the tactic I used on nearly every trick in my UV30 to get tricks work
        properly. Map07 rocket jump was exception, but map14 rocket jump wasn't because
	I made that trick 35 times in a row... Yeah I know it's stupid, but I laughed so
	hard because so many hours wasted just because I tried to do it with luck based
	tactic.

  lv04: I raged if the end jumps failed. Here the time is good, but it is .06

  lv05: 30 is bad time imo.

  lv06: Hmm, I tried the "yellow key grab" here but failed and messed everything.
	Next time I don't care if I stand on that trigger. Time is ok.

  lv07: Time is good :))

  lv08: I'm happy with under 30 seconds.

  lv09: My personal record is 1:01 so :) But if I aim for EP1 record, maybe I use different
	tactic in the yellow key room... :) I tried 'it' with nomonsters and it works enough
	often with rocket launcher, but it's  more likely a different story with monsters
	around :/ (unless one lost soul blocks the door from closing, hint for map09 speed :)

  lv10: This time is joke. Route is wrong and slow for a EP1 record.
