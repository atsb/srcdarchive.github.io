Description: Much harder than I thought..I am ashamed of level 7 and 10...

             You can't rush it like you do in a single level entry, since
             it's not very pleasant to enter the next level with say 10%
             health...

             Hopefully my one and only 100/100 -Fast 01-10 entry...

[  Admin. Note :-)  This kind of entry is NOT the kind of thing I was
   looking for, as missing a monster or a secret would make the whole
   .LMP "invalid", but if that's what you players want to play for...

   So be it ! To beat this entry you must score more kills(!) or more
   secrets(!) (not possible) OR go FASTER _without_missing_anything_!

   Also, since this is so long and PS(Peo) has supplied his own table
   of data - Thanks PS(Peo) - I'll just believe the overall time that
   he claims especially because he didn't miss any monster or secret.

   Oh, how many points does this score --> FIVE ! [ For now ;-) ]
