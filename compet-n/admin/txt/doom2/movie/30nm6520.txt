                                     [ Gross Time  =  77:50 min ]


    When I finished the 21 level recording at the end of last year, I
    was sure I would not play DooM II ever again...

    But then Demonlord came up with his 23 level LMP and by this time
    had completely taken over in the Compet-N listings.

    There are a lot of small improvements in his route. He did not face
    the real task, level 22, though.

    So I installed DooM II again, printed the maps, worked out a way
    through the remaining levels and started playing...

    There was but one condition: I wanted to do all the levels in less
    than one hour. So I preferred, whenever possible, faster but more
    dangerous routes to slower and safer ones.

    Although I didn't quite make it, I think that 65 minutes is not a
    bad time...


    A few words about some of the levels
    ------------------------------------

      Map  5: I have to get the plasma gun here because I won't do it
              in level 6.

      Map  6: I leave the Spider alone. It does not kill me, so why
              should I kill it ?

              The "exit-jump" was not very convincing.

      Map  8: Demonlord is right, the backpacks are not worth the trouble.

      Map  9: I used to follow a rather defensive strategy here. This is
              now fixed.

      Map 10: This one is easy. And you can still use the second
              invulnerability to reach the other blue sphere and the
              plasma gun in case something goes wrong.

      Map 11: Demonlord's route makes this much easier.

      Map 12: Easy. The end is the most accurate timed part of the
              whole LMP, however.

      Map 13: Easy with Kai-Uwe's route.

      Map 14: I follow Demonlord's way here. Not very hard.

      Map 15: The jump is so simple, it can't go wrong. You might
              miss the radiation suit, however.

      Map 17: Not so difficult after I watched Anthe's and Demonlord's
              versions.

      Map 21: You don't have to get the blue key. And make sure you
              finish with 200%/200%.

      Map 22: By far the hardest level. I think id forgot to put in
              an invulnerability somewhere. As you see, I don't have
              a good solution for this one, I just hope for the best.
              The critical points are the two times when you enter
              the central room via the elevators as you don't know
              what awaits you.
              If you could find a way to the blue sphere that costs
              less than 100% health...

      Map 23: A nice level, but not as easy as it looks. The Pain
              Elementals really are a pain...

      Map 24: Just don't fall off... or at least not too often.

      Map 25: You'd better hurry through it.

      Map 26: Similar to level 17, but slightly easier.

      Map 27: Somewhere to relax...

      Map 28: You have 5 invulnerabilities. If that's not enough...
              I use this one to get max ammo and 200% health/armour
              so as to be well prepared for level 29.

      Map 29: A tough one. Just stay alive.

      Map 30: You need some good timing to actually hit the brain.
              Apart from that - No problem.
