  Description: This is Bloody Hard !!!

               Almost went mad a couple of times when ending up with
               98% or 99% kills on the later levels... This is a LOT
               harder than playing the episode in speed, however, if
               you play every level real slow and check for monsters
               in every possible corner it shouldn't be any prob...
               But who wants to do that ???
               Tried to play every level as fast as I possibly could.

[  Admin. Note :-)  This kind of entry is NOT the kind of thing I was
   looking for, as missing a monster or a secret would make the whole
   .LMP "invalid", but if that's what you players want to play for...

   So be it ! To beat this entry you must score more kills(!) or more
   secrets(!) (not possible) OR go FASTER _without_missing_anything_!

   Also, since this is so long and DanielL has supplied his own table
   of data - Thanks DanielL - I'll just believe the overall time that
   he claims especially because he didn't miss any monster or secret.

   Oh, how many points does this score --> FIVE ! [ For now ;-) ]
