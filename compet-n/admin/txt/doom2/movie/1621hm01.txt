  Description :-)

  ... Slow - But Good ...


  Level 01 - Just ran for the exit but I got off to a slow start
             and the two F... humans cost me those three "vital"
             seconds - Yes, LV01-007 IS possible ;-) 6 Even ;-)

  Level 02 - Forget about the par time... 1:30 is impossible :-(
             Just get the Super Shotgun and fill up with shells.
             You'll save time with this baby later. Anyway, they
             all fell fairly nicely. See me take a careful touch
             at the red key (now why did I do that ;-) and I got
             through the red-lock room without the door closing!
             Later, one imp was a bit of a problem but the other
             wasn't. At P+19, my time was still a bit slow. ;-(

  Level 03 - I avoided the first room nasties OK. And the second
             room went fine (Super Shotty ;-) Got well armed and
             dangerous - before running over the chaingun to the
             blue key-door combination. Hit that button and came
             back for the new secret pack. Next, the red key pit
             went very well and came out at P-33 :-) The P times
             for Levels 02 and 03 should IMnsHO be reversed !!!

  Level 04 - Starting this level is always a problem but I still
             stayed above above the 100's :-) Once again, I take
             a careful touch at one of the keys ;-) The blue one
             then jump for some secret shells - The red key room
             was no problem but the last room can be a bitch - I
             take 46% damage on the "bridge jump" but for a time
             of P-26 (And a +100% on level 05) it was worth it!

  Level 05 -

  etc...
