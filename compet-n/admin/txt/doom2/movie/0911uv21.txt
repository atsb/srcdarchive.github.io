  Description :-

  This is a good .LMP file to show to a DOOM II newbie :- Yes, it is easy
  to solve all of the problems (but I don't like to disclose any secrets)
  it's just too fast to learn something from this recording.

 The COMPET-N list is once again dominated by German speaking players and
 QUAKE is coming very soon: there is no need for any new records any more
 but I'll still defend my position if anyone tries to get my points.
