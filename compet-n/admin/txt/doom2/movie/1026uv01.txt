Description: This is a hard and frustrating task and to anyone who doesn't
             have the patience nor the time I'll just say:  Forget it!

             Level 1 is rather good, I'm satisfied with the time though
             it could be done in 6 seconds.

             Level 2 is just average not very good at all, I think that
             every time below 1.10 is good, but 1.15 is too high.

             Level 3 is very good, could be done 2-3 seconds faster but
             you need alot of luck to do this, so I'm satisfied.

             Level 4 is better then average though it could be done faster.

             Level 5 is good but not at all perfect, to complete this level
             faster leave the 200% armor.

             Level 6 is good, not perfect though, I got stuck a couple of
             times.

             Level 7 is good and I'm satisfied with the time, I've done this
             level in 1.01 from scratch so it could be done faster.

             Level 8 is very good and I have nothing to complain about.

             Level 9 is average and I'm truly pissed at this level, those
             ...... pain Elementals, they're always in the way.

             Level 10 is average, I've done this level in 0.46 from scratch
             so the time could be somewhat better.
