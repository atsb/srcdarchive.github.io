Description: YAHOO!!! :) ...needed hours and hours of trying...
             about 8 monthes ago I started this ...and now it's done :)

             The second Doom 2-NM-run through all 32 maps.

	     Everything started when i did a 03nm for PublicDANG.
             Patrick "BauM" von Massow watched it in the pages of 
             DANG site and almost forced me to finish map04 !
             A few days later (2 may 1999) i got a 04nm (i still have the demo:)
             then 2 hours later i reached map07... and died...
             3 days later (5 may 1999) i finished map07 for the first time
             and even reached map10 in the same lump !!! Map09 is considered 
             as a very hard nm map ... in fact i rarely have problems there...
             I died in map10 cause i wasted too much cells in map09.. :(
             The 10 may 1999 i die in map19 with a stupid route error....
             
             Then a big break of two months to get my first 21nm at the
             of june. I was really not prepared for map22... so 
             I practised a lot with fillup.wad (thx Istvan) and a few days
             later i got a 22nm which was upload to Compet-N. (6 july 1999)
  
             Again, after a break of one month i managed to die in map29 ! (7 aug 1999)
             I did it as a free interpretation for my Doom2 Incubus exam...
             It was really slow and full of mistakes so i didn't upload.

             Then i stopped trying for 30nm for three months... I practised 
             map29 with fillup.wad and managed to find a quite safe route... 
             so i tried again and got a new 28nm dying at the top of the hill !!! (07 nov 1999)
             Then i knew i could do the 30nm... so... like Panter... i tried to do e3nm
             which i achieved the 14 nov 1999. 

             Then i got this on nov the 27th 1999 :) map29 went perfectly...
             but many maps went quite wrong... grrr... :( I think i could be
             close to Panter's 49:xx.

             I kept all the demos that reach map07... I added the number of death
             in each level from 7 to 30 since I started until i got this 30nm. You can see 
             that the biggest barrier is map07 followed by map12 then map22. 
             Map29 wasn't really a barrier since i practised it a lot for Compet-N 
             and with Fillup.wad (thx again and again Istvan!!!).

	     I dunno if i'll retry to do the whole thing like Panter....         
          
	     
LEVEL  1: Hmmm, 0:09 .... rarely happens but i don't want to restart 10-20 times
          like Panter or Sedlo to get 90-100 % in 0:05 or 0:06. My only goal
          is to get 100% for map02.
          Also, I never tried to get the green armor, IMO too much time is lost.
	  And, hmmm.... :), maybe Sedlo is right i'm a lamer... I've never managed 
          to do 0:05 here... even on UV.. :(( 

LEVEL  2: Like Panter i'm quite angry with the time... usual around 1:20...
          I did many stupid things...          
          But that's my first try of the day so i was not really "warm" :(
          
LEVEL  3: Another bad level.... i fall one time cause of an imp...
          and i missed the jump to the blu switch... something that happens
          "very" rarely... :( usual 0:42

LEVEL  4: This one went quite well... I try the pacifist combination 
          in the end room only with >90% health.
          Else .... nothing can really go wrong if you know what to do.
          I managed to do it manytimes with about 50% of start health.    

LEVEL  5: Quite good time here (for me)... I used to have many probs with that
          last room in my nightmare beginnings...

LEVEL  6: Three jumps to perform for a safe route :
             - the first is rarely a prob
             - the jump to the megasphere is never a prob
             - but the jump to the yellow door is quite hard for me
               here i did it at third try  
          And i lost to many times to kill the specters
          I had a 1:35 one time.

LEVEL  7: The worst scenario occcured.... I've nearly pressed Q... :)
          But i decided to fight to the death....:) and the monsters
          had it in their ass... 189% kills !
          That's what i call a fight ! :) This rarely happen
          I usually get 1:25-1:30 here... I had a lot of probs here in
          my nightmare beginnings. In my last tries i almost made it at 
          every try... in this one shit happened.
          I died 44 times here before getting this 30nm... (44 x 06nm)

LEVEL  8: Some stupid errors here... first i awaked a caco by opening the
          wrong door so he always got in my way :-( then i forgot to open the
          one door to the BFG room => 10s lost to my usual time.
          And cause of that caco i fell down to 99% for map09.... not perfect :(

LEVEL  9: Not very good to start with 99% health here.
          So i played very safe and made without too much pain.          

LEVEL 10: An very easy level... I dunno why i have killed Cybie...
          => 15s lost...
          I never take the Soulsphere unless i have <75%.

LEVEL 11: Sometimes i have probs here... mostly at the cacos+spiders zone
          after getting the invul nothing can go wrong.

LEVEL 12: A tough map... i often have probs here...
          but this time i did a really stupid error... down to 14% 
          cause of one of my rockets while entering the last room.....
          I left the place to grab some medikits and come back.
          When back i used the safe "hungarian" method to get rid of 6 cacos.
          Then with some BFG evertyhing went quite well.
          My method here is to hide in th hole to be out of sight of the cacos
          then i rush off the hole with my hungry BFG ! :)
          Best : 1:25     Usual : 1:40
 
LEVEL 13: Not a lot of things can go wrong here...
          Died a few times here... mostly cause the blue key teleporter didn't work 
          and the mancogot me easily... and sometimes cause an imp respwaned at the 
          bad place and i missed my jump to the yellow key.
          In this one i missed the jump to the blue door two times but that's not 
          really annoying cause the invul lasts quite long.

LEVEL 14: Only the archie scene can go wrong here.

LEVEL 15: My route is quite long... blue armor and jump to the switch.
          Anyway quite easy level.

LEVEL 31: Never died here... who can die here ? :)

LEVEL 32: idem.... :) cell collector for the rest of the game

LEVEL 16: just run.... :) 
          Died only one time here... stuck by archie....:(

LEVEL 17: Long map but not very hard... you only have to know what to do.
          One error... forgot to activate the switch in the blue room...
          and something quite funny... the blue room spider got a bullet
          from a zombie and she couldn't kill him... so she didn't care about me :)
          I could grab the yellow very easily :))))).
          Else what to say ? Don't miss the jumps that release the cacos.

LEVEL 18: Completely screwed up my route ! 

LEVEL 19: That pole-trick is really not my thing :)
          The end specters tends to block me but my BFG say them "Hello!" 

LEVEL 20: The PE scene can go wrong... using plasma here helps a lot.
          I had one time the teleporter bug... really annoying after 19 levels :(
          Here i missed the megasphere... 0:15s lost ?

LEVEL 21: My goal here is to get out with 200/200... that happens sometimes...
          hmm not in this one :( 150/151...
          2 bad things can happen here...
          Activate the 4 switches slowly else you're stuck :(
          The yellow key teleporter does not work... like in this one... :(

LEVEL 22: Did some errors but nothing really went wrong... :) 
          cool ! 84% while exiting !

LEVEL 23: Some probs may occur here...
              - some skulls hit some barrels that explode on your face
              - the pigs block you and bite you to death
              - archie or the revenants respawn while killing the pigs
          Here i nearly got killed by the pigs => down to 22%. 

LEVEL 24: My golden rule :) ... don't fall ! :)
          The pig room and the skulls scene can go wrong.
          The pig room must be done quickly so that you can escape with 
          200/200... like in this run :)))

LEVEL 25: I only died one time in this. IMO that's not an easy level
          if you start with less than 120/120...
          I think that my route is quite safe... I use rockets from above in the blue key room
          to kill the spider and most of the pigs.

LEVEL 26: A very hard level for me... better hurry if you don't want the cacos to respawn and block
          the way to the exit.
          In this one everything went really well... except that last caco
          blocking the last door.

LEVEL 27: very easy....
          I followed Panter's route... 
          
LEVEL 28: Safest route that allows to be invulnerable 90% of the time :)
          Exit with 200/200 and 600 cells.
          Without such a level map29 would be hell.

LEVEL 29: Here is my route... :)
          I think it's the safest possible (for me of course) without using
          the FJS jump. I don't kill the cacos, and while waiting for the bridge 
          to raise i sit down on the teleport point of the cacos so that the cacos 
          can't teleport and annoy me :).
          Then when i reach the revenants room i activate the middle switch first
          (revenant+cell pack) then i go for the switch with the manco.
          This way one or two of the barons are often on the right side of the 
          teleporter. I don't activate the left switch, i use the little brother
          of the FJS jump... so you can hide from the baron's shot while you shit 
          him with the BFG.... worked perfect here :).
          This time the hill was not hard to climb with so much health ! :)
          I managed to exit with 96%.

LEVEL 30: How much luck i had !!!
          I got two PEs on my way ! Hopefully no Archies ! :)
          The first wasn't really a prob.
          But the second spawned many many heads everywhere !
          I exited RL in hands surrounded with heads !




          For this I want to thank some people :
 
          BauM :
          The starter of the whole thing... I had a lame 03nm and he
          had at this time a 11nm... He gave me a many advice...
          and he encouraged me many times while i wanted to stop :)
          A BIG thanks to BauM, a great Nightmare player...
          Baum plz... do a 30nm... it seems that you've stopped to play
          Doom2 these last days... too bad :(
             
          Istvan :
          For his great utility > FILLUP.WAD which helped me to find safe routes
          and practise levels... a thousand thanks for Istvan...
          Without him i couldn't have done this.

          Daniel "Demonlord" Lindgren : 
          He did make me start playing doom when i saw his great demos in 
          ftp.Cdrom.com... 
          Don't forget that he did a 21nm in 1996 !!!!
 
          Thomas "PanterD2S" Pilger :
          Obviously for his 30nm4949... :) and the advice he gave me.
          Hmmm....  you've lost your bet that i won't do the 30nm before
          Adam... :)

          Andreas "Anthe" Kren :
          By prooving that all doom2 maps can be done on nightmare skill.

          All the people that worked on the routes :
          Anthe, Panter, Istvan, Peo, Siebers, BauM, Ilya... there are so many  




       For those who are interested i can make (and i have) fillup demos 
       showing my routes for any levels.
