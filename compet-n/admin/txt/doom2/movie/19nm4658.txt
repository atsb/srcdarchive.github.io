  Description:

    As Daniel showed with his 10 level run, the Nightmare!-competition is
    getting harder. Time to put in a new entry of my own.

    My aim was to get at least through the secret levels but by some
    lucky chance I completed even level 17. It was the first and
    until now the only time I ever did this one. The farthest I normally
    get is (nearly) to the blue key. You will notice that I get really
    excited towards the end of it; I even can't make proper use of
    the BFG anymore (attacking the archvile).

    The levels after 17 are fairly easy; probably up to 24 (or 27?).
    Anyway, I was prepared only up to (and including) level 21, so this
    lmps does nearly reach this limit.

    A few words on some levels:

       Map  5: I use the plasma gun to fight the cacodemons at the end
               now. This has however the drawback that I can't use
               the plasma gun at the end of level 6.

       Map  7: It is only by some _very_ lucky chance that I never get
               hit by any of the mancubi throughout the level.
               My strategy was to draw all spiders close together in
               one corner. Unfortunately it turned out to be the one
               with the Megasphere in it.

       Map 13: I get the 200% health because it really helps in map 14.

       Map 32: The cyber-demon gets in the way. It was _very_ close.


    BTW, I did't work out the routes through maps 15 - 20 myself.
    I follow (with minor corrections) Uwe Girlich's way, as shown
    in his all-level-UV-run.
