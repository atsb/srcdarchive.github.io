   ...and time 26:59
              --------

  Hehe, can't believe when I look at the total time. I have to say this 
  is not the record, so I will not annoy you with long TXT, but still it's
  the second fastest 30uv, just 2s slower than Drew "stx-vile" DeVore.
  I guess this is the first 30uv with implemented map27 Archie trick.
  The trick wasn't planned when I started, but after screwed up map13 
  I decided to go for it to gain some extra seconds. My goal for 30uv
  was to get below 28min, but 26? Oh...just a dream. Maybe Vile will show
  us a 25min demo now..who knows...
