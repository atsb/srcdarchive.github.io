Description: PanterTV proudly presents...44s. faster than DL.

             Believe it or not...THIS is my 1st attempt ! No joke...
             I just watched Dl's route, and thought I could improve some
             levels.
             Watch IT ! you'll see many many (little) mistakes, even in map11
             (Normally the first maps in a movie a the best ones)

             In the last maps I chosed the routes in the endscreen of the
             previous map...
             IMO ep2 is the easiest D2 episode...A lot of Health, easy monsters
             and no REALLY hard place...ok I nearly died in 15..but HEY...it's
             just a practise .lmp (:


             Level11: Uwwweehhh...

             Level12: I couldn't use my lv12-045 route here (too risky) but I
             got lot's of plasma cells here.

             Level13: Doesn't look too good but time is nice..

             Level14: hmmm...health gets critical here...and I had some luck at
             Archie...

             Level15: Uhhhhh...min. Health is 4%...but this route is just
             faster.

             Level31: Hmmm..I took that sphere in order to save some health..
             well, I didn't work (:

             Level32: ROTFL...I just change to the wrong weapons from time to
             time...see map11 for example..

             Level16: Bad things happened at the red key...and the end was NOT
             planned like this...this is the worst level in this movie
             (compared to DL)

             Level17: Hehe...35s. faster than DL...not perfect, but very good
             (for a movie)

             Level18: Ups..wrong weapon (:

             Level19: You just can't do any Ilya-tricks in a movie here...
             But time is nice....

             Level20: 88/48....hmmmm...IMO...it is too risky to jump w/o a rad.
             ...and with 80/200 I could leave the megasphere.
