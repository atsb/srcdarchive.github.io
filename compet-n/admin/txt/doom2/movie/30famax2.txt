  This is my first 30famax, don't expect a superb movie. I made some 
  mistakes during the recording, specially in the 3rd episode where
  I started to be nervous (map26 sucks a lot). On the other hand some
  maps went really good. I took the safest routes I know, so the lowest
  health I had was 24% and that happened in map30. ;) More risky playing
  could break 2 hours, definitely. Special thanks goes to Vincent, he
  showed us this is possible some 3 years ago.
