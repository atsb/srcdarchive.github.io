Description: About the levels:

             This is a frustrating task...

             Level 01: Is quite OK.

             Level 02: Pleased with the time.

             Level 03: Could be faster...

             Level 04: Time isn't good, should be 0.55.

             Level 05: Time's very good.

             Level 06: Time's OK.

             Level 07: Time's bad.

             Level 08: Not good at all.

             Level 09: Time is good.

             Level 10: Could be faster.

             With this .LMP I improved my old record by 14 seconds.
