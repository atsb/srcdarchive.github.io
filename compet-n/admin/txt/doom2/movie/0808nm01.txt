Description: This wouldn't have happened without Henning's advice on map02 and map09.
He also introduced me to the teleporter shortcut in the end of map06 which makes the 
jump easier. Thank you Henning. 

I still suck in map7 especially. I think I'll improve this one
further sometime soon, unless Skogsto comes back with a 7:55 or something.
