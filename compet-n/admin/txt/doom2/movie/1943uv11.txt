Description: About the levels:

             Level 11 Is a pain in the ... not because it's hard but because
             of the pain elemental near the end, he's blocking your
             way (just before the room with the caco-demons) and you simply
             can't get passed him (you will fall down at the poison floor
             and you have to rerun the whole thing, takes too much time),
             only with a great deal of luck can you run by him, I did, but
             I tried severel times. The time is very good, almost
             perfect. Though I believe you could leave the Invunarability.

             Level 12 I took the Super Shotgun cause I don't know how to play
             without it (In speed mode that is). Time is average.

             Level 13 I'm satisfied with this level, the time is good.

             Level 14 Rather easy level if you plan it well, I'm satisfied
             with the time.

             Level 15 Very fast level this one, the time is good.

             Level 31 Very easy level. Maybe you shouldn't take the things
             beyond the demon-room...

             Level 32 Just run and fire rockets.

             Level 16 Rather easy level and very fast, time is very good.

             Level 17 This is a real slow level, a lot of weapon changing
             is the main reason for that. The time is rather good.

             Level 18 Not much to say, just run and use BFG.

             Level 19 I still can't understand the door-button thing...

             Level 20 Rather good time, though I walked back into the
             teleporter.
