Comments:
---------
   You might have expected this after seeing my episode2 run. I was working
   on this about 1 week. Pity I didn't practise the third episode at all.
   This demo contains some lucky parts (like I got down 2 Cybies in just
   4 BFG shots) as well as some unlucky ones. I screwed up map17, map29 and
   map30. I got to the wrong teleport in map17, it caused a lot of problems.
   In map29 I couldn't remember the optimal route, so I just tried to kill
   everything as soon as possible. And map30 ? Heh..the start was nice,
   got on the lift, 2 rockets to the brain, but then got a bit nervous
   (especially after Archie appeared) and couldn't finish it. I knew 
   exactly what was going to happen when I shot the very last rocket. 
   Yeah, you know, I just died, heh (very stylish end of the nearly 2 hour
   max run IMO :). The other maps are more or less acceptable for me. Hope 
   this run is still valid.
