  TOTAL      22:16   


Map29 : I still can't undertstand how icould finsih it with sooo many errors...
        Everytihng went fine until the revenant room. (entered with around 195/160)
        Activated the middle switch...ok ... fine...
        Then i wanted to activate the swith kept by the mancubus...
        When i wanted to jump... he shot... i fell into the gap... I had to teleport
        back right at the beginning ! Then i made all the way to revenant room...
        Did many mistakes, fell many times, was out of cells... but i made it to the exit!
       
        That's the first time that happen... and that happens in a "real" try (i tried it 
        many times with Fillup.wad by Istvan... thx Istvan:)

	Maybe i'll do a better one ... map29 can 2min faster
