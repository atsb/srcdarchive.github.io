  Description :-)

  I already had a recording in 23 mins, ready for uploading, but I
  waited to see Uwe's (great) 30 level run. And the decision to wait
  was right, since only minutes after seeing that .LMP I re-recorded
  this one of "Episode 2" 3 mins faster. I tried to use Uwe's routes
  in Maps 15 & 16 but got a little lost - I think you, the watcher,
  will surely recognize this. In Map 12 Uwe's route is "nothing" for
  me, because I (have to) go for the double barreled too. In my next
  recordings I won't do this (and get my 1:30 time again :-) Most of
  the times are not my personal best times - so after my three week
  America holiday I'll record a faster version. In the meantime you
  will hopefully have pleasure with this .LMP :-)
