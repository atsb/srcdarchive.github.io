  Description:
  
    MAP01-MAP05:  Ok.

    MAP06 & MAP07: Slow.

    MAP08: I lost too many seconds here. Seems to me I can't handle this 
           map on fast. I usually try to get through pigs, grab BFG and  
           take 2 pics of them. But after watching Ian's demo I thought
           his route is better and wanted to kill all pigs by rockets. 
           It was much harder than I expected. Ian made things look so 
           easy in his demo (don't forget to watch it, if you haven't 
           done it yet).

    MAP09: Could have spent some more rockets in the lifts room.
           
    MAP10: Heh...have no problems with this map since fighting over it
           with Ole.            


    I think 26min is reachable (with some luck, of course :)
