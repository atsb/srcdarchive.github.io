Description: I'm just too lazy for a table...
	     Did this about a week ago..but now is the right time to upload..
             Incoming gets bored...only d1-respawn entries (where I just read
             the .txts cause I can't say anything about the route anyway)...


Map 01 - Got some 5's here from time to time

Map 02 - Hardest Map for ep1...1:02 is ok, although I got some 51's too.

Map 03 - Why a jump to the sphere ? it's just UV... (:
		
Map 06 - If you manage to get both jumps, time should be under 1:10
	 Watch your health for map7.

Map 07 - urgs...

Map 08 - Just luck (not this time)

Map 09 - over-urgs

Map 14 - Yeah...a bit too fast...maybe shouldn't take this route (:

Yes...I'm very curt...Henning will beat this anyway...at least 7:30 is
possible...hmmm.lmp is added to show this (and because it looks really good :)
