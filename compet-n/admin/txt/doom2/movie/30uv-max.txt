                             DOOM2 - HELL ON EARTH
                             ---------------------              
                        THE ULTRAVIOLENCE MAXKILL MOVIE 
                        -------------------------------                                   
              (Inspired by the version Demonlord made back in 96')


Puh, this was harder then expected. Took me quite some hours over the past
two days. I reached map21 yesterday, but forgot one imp. This demo has no
missing secrets, and to my knowledge all enemies are killed. Guess this is
the first demo with 100% kills and secrets through all maps then? :-)
Daniel "Demonlord" Lindgren came sooo close, only missing one damn secret
in map27. My goal was to beat DL's full run time. That objectiv was achived,
I'm actually faster in all maps except map28. My total time is 32 mins and 50 secs faster. But the demo is far from perfect, I got big troubles in map20. I thought the small ledge with the 100 cell-pack was a secret, so when it jamed and I couldn't reach it I messed around for a long time. Finally I exited and discovered that the stats said 100% after all. Map24 went slow, so did 28 and 30. And in map15 I forgot the blue-key...But all in all its an ok run I guess? This is a fun way to play, but also very frustrating. Several times I played for more then an hour, only to forget a secret / enemy. I even once got to map16 and accidently pressed Q :-) Special thanx goes to Henning who sat besides me through map13-30 and assured no secrets was forgotten. His great map-knowledge came in handy...

Of course a run like this can never get 100% flawless, I know there is alot
of slow spots in this movie. Still I think its entertaining to watch, and
I would really like to get some feadback. Maybe it can help others to
complete their own movie-versions (what do you think Jason?).
I may try to make a faster recording...that depends if anyone bothers to beat
this one ;-) Below two hours would be my next goal.
