[  Admin. Note :-)  This kind of entry is NOT the kind of thing I was
   looking for, as missing a monster or a secret would make the whole
   .LMP "invalid", but if that's what you players want to play for...

   So be it ! To beat this entry you must score more kills(!) or more
   secrets(!) (not possible) OR go FASTER _without_missing_anything_!

   Also, since this is so long and DanielL has supplied his own table
   of data - Thanks DanielL - I'll just believe the overall time that
   he claims especially because he didn't miss any monster or secret.

   Oh, how many points does this score --> FIVE ! [ For now ;-) ]
