Description :)

 Finally I got it...

 Some words about the levels
 -level  7: This time it's looks quite easy, but it's not for me...
            It made me a lot of pain. 
 -level 10: When I got my first invuln. I have 157% health, when I got
            my second ... so not such a big deal here!
 -level 12: One of the hardest maps for me... thanks goes to Gabor for 
            the route, the rockets makes it way easier.
 -level 17: The tricks invented by Daniel and Anthe helped me a lot... 
            but I still made some mistakes there. Watch Steffen's 19nm
            to find how hard it is without these tricks.
 -level 19: The real nightmare for me begun here... This map is one of
            my favorite maps, I like it... but this time the pink's made
            me some surprises, maybe they learned my route, and want to
            made me angry :))  ( loosing here 1 minute)
 -level 20: This map is quite easy... but after such 19, I tought I 
            better take a rather safe and slow route... :( 
            (loosing 1 minute again)
 -level 21: I had before this recording some other 20nm recordings (3 of
            them), 
            first I've tried Anthe's route -> dieing in yellow key room
            then Steffen's route -> dieing in front of the switch which
				    lowers the red key platform
	    3rd I pressed some buttons too fast and the doom engine 
            stucked me... :(
	    So this time... Anthe's route again,it become rather close,
            and a silly mistake made the end harder :) 
	    Interesting, when I practiced this level, no mistakes at all.
 	    The problem is when I record I become very very excited :( 

 -level 22: Died there,  but I think I had a real chance to do it...
	    During the practice session I made it in quite good ratio.

 
  My aim was to beat Daniel's 21nm recording, it's done! The time was no 
  problem for me, but that bloody level 21 made me some pain. I got a 
  20nm recording which is even faster than Steffen's split time in his 
  30nm recording, this time I loosed about 3 minutes in my last 3 maps,
  but the lower maps (I mean bellow 13) played quite well, so I'm satis-
  fied with this recording. I was prepared even for level 23, but it  
  depends on health, way lower chance there, level 24 is a nightmare for
  me... I'll never make it!

  Many thanks to Steffen, Daniel, Anthe for their wonderfull recordings,
  my work was only to choose one of the routes, and practice it.

  Thanks goes to Laci, and Gabor for being my partners in coop run, and
  helping me a lot with their ideas and tips. 
  ( it's a secret but Gabor is trying too, his current best is a 13nm, 
    soon you can watch another great nm run )

  Big hi to Yonatan, because he is a keyboarder like me, keep on good
  work, we can save the keyboarder's reputation :) 

  Hope you'll enjoy it!
