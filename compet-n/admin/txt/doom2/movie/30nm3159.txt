C-N entry #203, movie run #37.

Well... I still don't believe this time.  I don't know
what I did to deserve this time, but here's yet another
step in the evolution of the 30nm route.  I had some new
stuff in mind, sat down the first night to try them out..
and got this run right away.  I would imagine I would
have died on map12, map25, or map29 at least, but I've
been given a new run immediately.  The map11 problem
from the previous movie was removed, new routes on maps
12/19/25, and lots of time shaved off on maps 23/29.
Somehow, I skipped right over 32:xx... weeee!

However, the following things can still kiss my ass:

-> map06 jump screwed me again... seems to work fine in
practice, otherwise I mess it up.

-> map18 invuln grab... I should have just cut it out of
the run, since it hardly works when I want it to.

-> map19 glide trick was really stubborn this time... the
new route (shown to me by Radek, so credits to him) would
have shaved off more time, but I had to deal with a messy
trick.  It happens sometimes, I just have to deal with it.

Anyway, I hope you like the run, since I may be done for a
good while.  I don't know what's next, if anything, but I'm
taking a break. :)
