Description: Hehehe.....15 min's of work :))
	     The first try ended in 24, then I got this one. Was quit lucky at
	     the acrhie scene. Apart from that there are lotsa mistakes, 
             I think a time under 10 min will be extreamly good. 
             I think Uwe Girlish's cheated run is 09:41 or something..
