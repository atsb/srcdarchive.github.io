Description: I did this one during the .nor 2001 summer lan so I thought it was about time
             I uploaded it. I was originally gonna try and get it down to 59:xx or whatever 
             but as it turns out this won't be happening but atleast this is quite close :)
                        
             Btw mr Hamels sorry that I havn't included your comments I somehow couldn't 
             find the file I did put together when you were @ .nor lan :(
