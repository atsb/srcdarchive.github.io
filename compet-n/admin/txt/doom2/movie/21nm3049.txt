Description: ok, this isn't my first 21nm but the only one I could be abit 
             satisfied with. Next time I'll upload, will be when I at least 
             get's to 29. Anyway think I used all the best routes possible 
             here I usualy don't take the fastest route in map15 but this time 
             I was very healthy and had lotsa armor. My normal time will be 
             around 1 min here.                   
             
             If you wanna complete doom2 on nightmare there are certain stages
             that at least I had to go throu....to get up to map22 at least :)
             
      Note!! As you all know Panter already did a fantastic 30nm so you can 
             also read his .txt ofcause. Maybe you like more his way of doing
             things. Though it's pretty much the same.
             That will also give you hints about how to to the following maps 
             after 22....and the map22 itself :-)
             
             I used most of his routes anyway....Thanks !    

     Map04:  The first little problem occures in map04, but you will get the
             grip on this one easily. Just use the right tactics and you'll be
             fine. Belive me map02 and 03 are harder. 

     Map05:  As you play on, someone might find the ending scene in map05 hard. 
             (you read this Arno :)
             Well I'll say, just wake up two of the cacos....you eigther kill 
             them both with the Rl or only kill the one right next to you.
             I never had any problems with this one, so you shouldn't 
             eigther :) Though seeing the lost souls here aren't a good idea, 
             still it isn't to risky if you have 150\150 here. The alternative 
             route here will be to run back were you came from. 

     Map07:  I have been collecting over 50< nm06 .lmps. Map07 is unfair when 
             playing nm. You will die here ALOT, and it's a real trouble maker. 
             and I know it will become boring always dying there. But now I 
             have a survival rate at 80% here. It's real fun to get past that
             bitch all the time. 


     Map12:  I really can't see any hard parts until this shows up. The only
             really hard part here is the end room. Yeah you know what I'm
             talking about. But it's nothing against getting past map07. 
             I played stupied here this time and I exit with 5%. This usually 
             don't happen.
        
              
    Map15:   Could get tricky and I have died some times in here. I DON't 
             recommend the route used here. There are many alternative routes 
             here. I normally take the 200% + the rad-suit and jump down in the
             lava, then I'll activate the switch from downstaris. The I'll 
             ofcause run towards the invul. This should offer you great saftey.
             And time will be around 1 min. 

    Map17:   This is my Personal trouble map. Don't think it should be, not 
             good here eigther. DO NOT trigger the first lindef with red-key.
             Then HELL is really lose. Have done this and I had no chance.  
             

    Map22:   OK here ends my journy. I used to much cells in map18 cause I 
             didn't get my invul. Almost died there too, down to 10%< again :(
 

Wanna thank all the people that created these routes, I certantly don't have 
a route brain :)) I just did some small modifications there and there. Maybe 
some better weapon usages. Remember to use as much cells you can up to map32.
