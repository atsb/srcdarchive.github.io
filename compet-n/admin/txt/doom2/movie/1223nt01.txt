  Description :-)

  ... Slow - But Good ...

  *ALL* Levels Under PAR!

  But on "Hey, Not Too Rough" Skill Two... so they should be ;-)

  I took another look at my 1320NT01.LMP, and thought... I could
  do this better by, perhaps, as much as a min... & I Could :-)


             I'm tired of writing descriptions... watch the .LMP

  Level 01 -

  Level 10 -

             And there I Stop, wait 20 sec. and then Hit "Q" :-)


  1013ty01 - "Episode One" - Skill 1 - all in 10 min. 13 sec.
  1223nt01 - "Episode One" - Skill 2 - all in 12 min. 23 sec.
  1621hm01 - "Episode One" - Skill 3 - all in 16 min. 21 sec.

  Next...

  ????uv01 - "Episode One" - Skill 4 - all... if I can ;-) ??

  Done! ( But only very slowly ;-( )

  So, Beat This - Or do "Episode 2" Or maybe "Episode 3" - Or an
  even better demo on a, more acceptable, ie. higher Skill Level
