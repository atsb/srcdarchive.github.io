Description:
This was a lot of work, took 3 months to go from 19:36 to 19:28.

A very solid run, the biggest single time loss was just a revenant block on map 22.
I think the changes to the route since 30uv1959 saves about 25 seconds, I also increased my
mouse sensitivity a while ago which helped a great deal with movement and being a bit
quicker at finding the correct angles for certain tricks. 

There's a couple of more things that could be included to save time, the biggest
being going for the glide on map 02 without killing the hitscanners. However, 
using some very "exact" calculations I concluded that it would take me more time to get
under 19:30 if I accounted for how often it fails, so even though there are still 
improvements it might not help with getting a faster time.

As always thanks to elim and looper!

Map 01: I could increase my chances of getting 5 seconds by doing things slightly different,
but that would also increase the chance of getting 7 seconds, so I just go for 6 seconds.

Map 02: Decent time, perfect luck with the barrels for once!

Map 03: Good time here as well, always nice to get the chaingun before skipping the blue key,
since I don't have to rely on the shotgun killing the chaingunner in a single hit.

Map 04: Really good time, I only use 1 rocket on this map now since I think overall it's a bit 
faster and easier if I use 1 on map 03.

Map 05: Bad movement at the start of the map, really bad time here, usually I get 26-28 here.

Map 06: I rarely do well on this map, usually I lose a second to my safer strategy of 
doing the jump to yellow key door, but I failed it so often before that it's worth it.

Map 07: Slightly different start, better manipulation of the mancubi.
SL40 -> MF50 SL50, so I had to do the setup for RJ again as I need to hit MF50 SL50 on first tic.
Usually I get 12 seconds here, 11 seconds if the setup is really quick. 

Map 08: Really lucky here, while the cyberdemon shooting right away is usually bad luck, it turned out to 
be quicker as I managed to get through. I also had enough rockets so I could ignore the second 5 rocket
pack. 

Map 09: Good time here, everything went well, also managed to keep mega armor for the next map
which is really nice.

Map 10: Went very well, managed to get the blue key through the wall and didn't get blocked too badly.
5:17 total matches current e1 record, I have a few seconds faster somewhere in all the failed attempts.

Map 11: I was planning to activate the other switch at the start here since it's faster 
(it can easily cost 2 seconds instead if I don't active the second switch in time), 
but it's only 1 second faster than the usual switch if I ignore the chaingunner first.

Map 12: Managed to do the yellow key grab through the wall, I use a setup for that now so it works
every time if it's done correctly. A bit unlucky with the elevator in the bottom left corner not 
going upwards straight away, but the rest was perfect so I got a really good time here.

Map 13: Only once have I telefragged the archnotron so I wasn't sure what was going to happen
when dropping down (you might build up too much momentum and fail the jump I think). Everything
went ok and I got lucky with the elevator going down straight away (if it doesn't I lose 3 seconds).

Map 14: Chaingunner survived my first SSG shot, if I lower the elevator while he is on the other side 
then I would waste a lot of time so I always kill him before lowering it. Usually I get 17-18 seconds here.

Map 15: Here's what happened at yellow key:
"I should pick up the health behind the pain elemental" 
"No, it's faster to grab it later" 
"Wait, was that the yellow key?"
Wasted 2 seconds on that, never missed the yellow key like that before.

Map 31: Bad movement cost me at least a second.

Map 16: Not the best health and the run was decent enough that I went for the health, time is ok.

Map 17: I'll never be happy with this map, but everything went well here except for missing
the chaingunner near the end, could possibly have been a 1:42 which would be amazing.

Map 18: Bad movement, usually I get 24 seconds here.

Map 19: Not the best time, but I'm happy to make it through. 
It is very common to bounce back when colliding with the key bars on this map.

Map 20: Not too difficult to get 35 seconds here.

Map 21: The second glide was almost instant, really lucky here as that one can be dangerous.

Map 22: A bit slow with the glide, for some reason I couldn't move a bit too the right once I was in the gap.
Unfortunately the damn revenant survived both BFG's and got a perfect position to block me.

Map 23: To me it looked like the mancubus was just about to fire, so I grabbed the green armor. 
Couldn't hear any barrels exploding so I could run across the barrels, PE almost blocking me though.
Almost missed the BFG afterward too, but 42 seconds is decent considering the bad start.

Map 24: A bit slow, I figured my time was decent so I get a bit nervous on those damn ledges and I slow
down a bit too much.

Map 25: Annoying amounts of damage before blue key door, but everything went well.

Map 26: Awful luck getting blocked by the cacodemon, managed to get past him quickly, but he blocked me again later.
Everything a bit too slow, missed the teleporter after YK so bad time.

Map 27: 21 seconds is good enough, I had 16 seconds the last time I was there but that is very rare.

Map 28: Awful time, blocked a bit too much. However I got lucky I didn't get blasted by a vile at the end.

Map 29: At this point I was still convinced my time would be good enough for sub 19:30, so I chose to use
plasma to kill the first revenant to make sure I don't lose my run to something really stupid. This probably
cost me 2 seconds and considering another 2 seconds would have made this worthless :)

Map 30: No bullshit spawns from the IoS or insane damage rolls like a previous attempt where 
I was hit by 2x80 damage from the revenant and 15,20,40,15,30,25,25 from an arachnontron in the back,
which was enough to push me off the platform (would have been 19:26).
