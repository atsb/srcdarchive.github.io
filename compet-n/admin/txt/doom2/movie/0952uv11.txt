              --------

  After a month break from doom I wanted to play something I never
  tried before. I watched Henna's demo and decided to go for it, or 
  at least try it. Didn't take me long to get 10:20 (1s slower than
  Henna), which pissed me off, but also proved I could beat it.  	     
  When I finished this demo I knew I did it, but didn't expect the time.
  I'm just happy it's below 10mins now. The demo itself isn't that bad,
  I was little afraid of my heatlh at the end of map31, but survived.
  I'm also glad I managed to avoid any major fuck ups during the demo, 
  so overall I can say I like it.
