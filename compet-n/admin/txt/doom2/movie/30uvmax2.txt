TOTAL TIME  123:17 = 2 hours 3 minutes and 27 seconds 

The overall time of the lump is 2 hours 6 minutes

Description :-)

watch the file i attached (LV10.PCX)...or while playing back the demo use -devparm and keep the F1 key hold...
the stats sreen with be "slow motioned".

I can hardly beleive it.... beats Anders by 10 big minutes... !! :)
This my last try for this... and he told me that he will try to go under 2 hours (120 min).

And this is really possible... i was only 3:17 away !
