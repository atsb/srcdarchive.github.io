  Description :-)

  Finally got this! This demo is a result of a
  four-and-a-half hour nonstop playing. I got
  1:47 three times...Hopefully this is a bit harder
  to beat than the old one =) In fact it looks still
  terribly slow, I got stuck to the Hell Knight (at
  least 3 seconds lost) and was really slow many times..
  Under 1:40 is surely possible. I may try this again,
  but not very soon...
