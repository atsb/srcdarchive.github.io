Description: ugh, in nightmare, this is a very simple level, but
             if you do it on ultraviolence and -respawn _and_
             100% secrets and kills, it's really _ULTRA_violent.

             you need some luck with the cyberdemon and also the
             fighting between the other monsters has to work for
             you. i found out, that the bfg-shot in the low-level
             room with the 30 imps (no, i have not counted them :-) 
             usually gives you the missing 10% kills. i found that
             the kill-ratio is the real problem in this level,
             because you never really know IF the fighting goes
             on without you... but you can always take out another
             50 demons with the good old chainsaw. takes some time
             though. :-)

             hm, i used to think that -respawn is quite dull, but
             after THAT level, i think i have to change my mind.

             hey rini, why don't you do it on skill 5 with 100%
             everything? :-)
