  Description :)
  You know there's something wrong when the UV -respawn record only beats
  the UV -fast record by one second and that's not even to mention that the
  UV MAX record is 10 seconds faster. So much for "It was stupid for
  respawn to be slower than max, so I had to change it."

  No fx! I had to change it! Not you! I!
