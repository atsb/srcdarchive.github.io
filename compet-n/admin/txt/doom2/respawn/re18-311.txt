Description:  this is it. my final contribution to map 18 -respawn.
              the fastest time i ever archived when playing for 100%
              kills and secrets.

              and again i did it with exactly 100% kills. well, maybe
              after all this 98% crap, the doom-engine realized that i
              truely deserve it... :-)

              all went tremendously well until the bfg-room. that
              second caco wanted to play. so i gave him something
              to play with: a rocket at zero distance, me dropping
              from 100/102 health/armour down to 14/60. thought it's
              time for the megasphere after that... :-)
