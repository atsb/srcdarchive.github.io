  Description:  This one has been MUCH harder than I had expected.
                I tried to play it faster and always ran completely
                out of ammo. It's not too easy to score 100% kills
                then. The way to avoid these problems is to do a lot
                of boxing.
                Btw:
                Watch the skull triggering the elevator in the red
                key room. I don't press all switches to get the key,
                but it's easier to do it the conventional way, because
                one has better control over the demons.
                What more to say - hmmm, "I hate those ledges ..."
