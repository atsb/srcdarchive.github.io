  Description :
  Oh, what a mess! Feels like cleaning up Augias' stable.
  Many, many secrets in this map make it quite hard to play
  on -RESPAWN for 100% secrets. You must choose your route very
  carefully, otherwise you will get stuck in a BIG crowd of
  monsters with rapidly decreasing ammo.
  That's the thing I like most in any new category
  (like -RESPAWN 100/100 or Pacifist), you have to find
  an apropriate route yourself without any templates.
  I collect the weapons early and use up almost every extra health
  and armor that's available, watch my health playing yoyo.
  After ending with 98/100 in 6:03 and 134/100 in aweful 7:43
  I'm quite contempt with this recording - think it's not too bad
  for a first entry (once again the end is a bit chaotic).
