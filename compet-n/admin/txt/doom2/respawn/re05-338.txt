  Description:  Though it has been fun to play this map "pacifist",
                it's an ugly level when playing for 100% kills.
                The -respawn switch doesn't make it considerably harder
                than plain UV. I guess one could squeeze the time
                extremely with an optimized route, but ...
                arggh, it's just too ugly.
