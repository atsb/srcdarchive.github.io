  Description:
  This map is so nice! But if you play it on speedy gonzales rules or
  on nightmare you won't visit the mancubus/revenant room - what a pity.
  On the other hand, if you play it on plain UV or -FAST it's not always
  fun to visit every single monster.
  So in this map "RESPAWN 100%/100%" is a good choice. Lot's of action,
  respawning archviles and spidermasterminds, playing all the nice parts
  of the map, but with no need to look after the last little imp.
