Description : This map was very fun in respawn mode...
              I think there is a much better route which makes things
              easier though..

              I wasn't very lucky in this lmp, but I don't put that much 
              effort in a respawn entry.....the main problem is to come up
              with a route which fit respawn playing..:-)
