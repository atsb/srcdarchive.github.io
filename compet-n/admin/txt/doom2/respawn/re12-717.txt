  Description:  This one has been much harder than I had expected.
                The time is very bad, because I killed by far too
                much monsters, but I don't like to record it again -
                maybe I will redo it when the collection of re100/100
                maps is completed.
                Btw:
                Surely all my -respawn 100/100 records will be beaten, it
                may take a real champ only one day to beat them all. Then
                you might say "poor little rini", but that's ok for me -
                I had a good time playing ...
                and I definitely will enjoy to watch these new records ;-)
