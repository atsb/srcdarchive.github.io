                Hi "Panter" don't stop playing respawn after five maps.
                I know that re05 is annoying, but try at least one
                of the fun-maps like 16, 23, 27 or the more challenging
                ones like 09, 22 or 24.

                And if that is too easy for you, play map09 on NIGHTMARE
                with 100% kills and secrets!
