  Description :
  The first 7 minutes or so are quite nice action, I think *).
  But then there occurs a big problem:
  When do I have 100% kills? Heart says: "Hey, it's all done, let's
  exit." But brain says: "No, I won't risk having below 100% kills!"
  So I go near the exit and start to fire my whole ammo in the crowd
  of monsters, nearly killing myself by idiotic rocket usage. As ammo
  is used up, I chainsaw a cacodemon. Heart says: "This isn't the right
  time to do RespawnTyson!" Brain agrees => exit.
  Puuuh, 102% - lucky I am ;-)

     wasn't that a good idea.
