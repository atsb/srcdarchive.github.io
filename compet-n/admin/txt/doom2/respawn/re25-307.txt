  RE25-307.LMP - Ultra Violence with -RESPAWN

  Recorded using Doom2 Version 1.9
  Doom2 -PlayDemo with Version 1.9

  Doom2 - Level 25 - BloodFalls

  Kills    101%
  (Items   100)
  Secrets  100%  and Time  03:07
                           -----

  Description :
  I think the -RESPAWN with 100% Kills and 100% Secrets section is really
  worth notion. In some maps this requirement is much harder than Nightmare
  or -FAST. You don't believe me? Play MAP08 -RESPAWN with 100%/100%!

  Back to this map again ;-)
  I've found no big difference to plain UV in this map. Maybe it's possible
  to push the time even below plain UV by an optimized selection of which
  monsters to kill once, twice or not at all. But therefore one should be
  able to play it close to "Demonlords" time of 2:11 on UV,
  and I'm definitly not!

  BTW: I'm sorry for the jerky manouevering :<
  1) I'm not used playing on a 486 any more
  2) I need much more practice with my new controller configuration.
