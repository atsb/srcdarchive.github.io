  Description:  This comletes the -respawn >= 100% kills and maximum secrets
                collection. I finished this map last, because I hate it when
                playing for 100% kills - all those stupid jumps.
                Time is quite bad, but I won't do it again just to make it
                faster (I leave that to you, poeppy ;-)
               
                When I think of all the maps I played in re100/100 style
                (we need a name for it!) the hardest were 09 and 22.
                Some of them are very enjoyable, like 23, 27, 28 with lot's
                of action and very short times. Maybe we should make it a
                DHT title ?!

                > what 100/100? You scored only 90% secrets!

                Oh yes, that's a bug, there are only 90% - sorry ...

                Btw:
                None of my -respawn entries is ment to be very fast, they
                surely will all be beaten easily. My intention was just to
                complete this collection.

                Enough bla bla .......
