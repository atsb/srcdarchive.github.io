Description:	Panter said that he didn't like this map, and I must say
	        that I agree. There are something about this map I don't 
		like, but I can't put my finger on it.

		This LMP is OK, but the time SUCKS when you look at the max.
		The max is on 2:33............. Oh well, I don't minde. I
		refuse spending more time on this map.
