  Description :

  This is a demo that I think I can be
  proud of.   It's actually a 41.17 so
  that shows that 40 is possible, and
  probably not of extreme difficulty,
  but I think it takes pretty good luck
  to get 2 good rocket kills and 2 wimp
  respawns like I did in this demo.
  Maybe if I can do 40 in UV than I may
  revisit this one.
