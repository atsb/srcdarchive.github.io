RE03-133.LMP - Ultra Violence with -Respawn

Recorded using Doom2 Version 1.9
Doom2 -PlayDemo with Version 1.9

Doom2 - Level 03 - The Gantlet

Kills    101%
Secrets  100%  

   ...and Time  01:33
               -------


Description: It's funny the max record have always been very good here.  
             Therefor I'm glad I managed to finaly bring this one down to
             a level were the respawn is faster than the max record :-)

             Had a 01:27 with 98 or 99% kills here. This is not far from 
             optimal I think. A very good time will be under 01:30. 
             Anyway, had a couple of 01:31 and 32 with 99% and 98 Kills.
             But I'll leave this one for now.
