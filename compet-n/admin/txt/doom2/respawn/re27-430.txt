  Description:  That's fun, try it yourself! 100% kills under PAR,
                -Respawn makes it easy. Sorry, I didn't get 100% secrets
                as well. But as you know one secret is a teleporter -
                so I think 87% is enough.
                Btw:
                Surely all my -respawn 100/100 records will be beaten, it
                may take a real champ only one day to beat them all. Then
                you might say "poor little rini", but that's ok for me -
                I had a good time playing ...
