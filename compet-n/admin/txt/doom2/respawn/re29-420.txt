Description:  Ok, this is my fourth and last D2 -respwan entry today. I don't
              think I'll ever do another one...The ONLY reason I did these
              maps, was to fill in the gaps in Jan's and Henning's respawn
              collection. With exception from map01, they all required very
              little playing, and the result was only medium....still I think
              I've cut some minutes all together. I wanna thank Rini for all
              his great routes I've used today. Now lets head back to the 
              other challenge I've been working with inbetween:
              E2M5 max....
