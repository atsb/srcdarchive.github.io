Description: Took alot more time than I expected, mainly because the map is
	     is a mess in 100\100 speeding.... It was a true nightmare to get 
	     100% kills..I used to follow Sedlo's route for 30min or so but 
	     using his method I only got 8x% kills. So I had to change it abit.
	     This way it's slower but more safe.
