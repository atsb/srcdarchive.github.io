  Description:  In this map it's very surprising which sectors are secrets
                and which are not. My aiming has improved (a bit) while
                training for nm04, so now it became quite easy for me to beat
                Thomas Zajic's initial entry. Surely it will be even easier
                for him to beat this record again ;-)
                Btw:
                Surely all my -respawn 100/100 records will be beaten, it
                may take a real champ only one day to beat them all. Then
                you might say "poor little rini", but that's ok for me -
                I had a good time playing ...
