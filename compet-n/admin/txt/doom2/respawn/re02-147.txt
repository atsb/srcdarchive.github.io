Description: Poor little Rini (:

             But someone has to improve all this -respawn entries, so I think
             I've got something to do this week (:

             I had exactly Rini's time in my first try, and it was really easy
             to produce this lmp.
             Hey Rini, please give this one another try...I'd like to see the
             maximum possible (should be around 1:20)
