                Well I disagree, I'd consider 22 and 29 somewhat harder,
                but this may be because I consequently avoid triggering ANY
                monsters releasing linedef. I had some problems with the
                jumps and play it very hectic (compared to the slowhand
                style when beeing a keyboarder), but anyway I think it's
                not too bad for a complete novice like me ;-)

                Expert will surely go for 4:00 ... Adam, Panter ?!
                ... it's a fun map.
