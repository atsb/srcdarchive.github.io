Description: Hmmm...maybe we should speak german in the -respawn category (:

             Ok Rini...You said I should try this map...and you're right, it IS
             fun.
             I got this .lmp after 15 min. (and IMO it looks rather bad)
             As you can see I improved Poeppy's route a bit...hmmm I shouldn't
             call it "Improvement"...it is more an "Improvisation"...I just
             walked around a bit more to find some %.
             Poeppy ? Rini ?..Anyone of you want to beat this ??? (:

             Huuu....I have to watch TV now (StarTrek-DSN), I'll upload it this
             evening. (-:
