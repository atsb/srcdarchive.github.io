  Description :

  Hoohoooo! 100 is a nice round number, isn't it? I sure breathed a sigh of
  relief when I hit the exit screen. Lucky me, I thought. I didn't realize
  how lucky! When I played it back I noticed the jangling of bones just before
  I exited. Thank you Mr. Mancubus :)

  I made one slight route change by the SSG. I didn't bother getting the
  suit which saved me a few seconds. It might be useful for the max record
  if someone wants to give it a go. I played that room badly and wasted
  a ton of plasma.

  Still room for improvement then. My advice is to try not to copy me and
  Vincent's leet strategy of getting exactly 100% (though it is stylish :)
