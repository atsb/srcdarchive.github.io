  Description:  This map isn't too easy even with -repawn. Incredible
                how Anthe played this on nightmare! The 100% secrets
                requirement is no burden - there are none ;-)
                In the end I make some stupid mistakes, so this recording
                is quite slow, but the goal was just to do another one of
                the harder maps.
                Btw:
                The first revenant has been a hard opponent, watch how
                quickly he respawned two times.
