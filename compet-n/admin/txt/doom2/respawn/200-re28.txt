  Description :
  One of my favorite maps. I've tried to play it unhitten on nightmare
  but the fast spidermastermind always stroke me. On respawn with SLOW
  monsters it's much easier, in fact this was my very first try.
  BTW: What do level 8, 18 and 28 have in common? Yes, they can easily
  be played without any damage.
