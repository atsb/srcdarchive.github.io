  Description:  That's a joke, you can't beat this, 1% is the worst score
                to reach. I did this because I needed a lmp to test Istvan's
                new script.
                Besides this, with respawning monsters this map isn't too
                easy even if it's not nightmare. I've practised this on
                nightmare today, because I need it for my DHT6 Incubus.
                I've reached the last room around five times already, but
                always invented a new way to _NOT_ finish it :-\
