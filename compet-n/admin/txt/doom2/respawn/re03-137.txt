Description: 3 seconds faster than Jan Endre Jansen. I made up this route
while playing the map for DANG, hadn't seen the record. I watched Jan's run
after doing this...his is an interesting route, but it suffers from the
respawn problem that the faster you go the harder it is to get 100% kills.
This route appears to be a bit more reliable. I don't really know which is
quicker. Jan thought his route could go to about 1:30, i'd say the same for
this one.
