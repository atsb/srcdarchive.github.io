  Description :
  Hey, that was much easier than my old 3:32 entry -
  looks like I'm getting used to the new controller config.
  { can't he just STOP boring us with
    this silly controller config stuff? } Ok, I'm sorry.
  Now I wonder how long it will take 'til poeppy beats me again,
  or maybe a .COM boy (and this extension surely matches Peo,
  Yonatan and Istvan) plays this in 2:30 and ends our "private"
  competition.
  I haven't played for COMPET-N for quite a while, so now I really
  like chatting in the descripion.
  Btw: there is a new mode of doom playing - the "Pacifist" style.
  This is completing a level on UV without harming any monster.
  Stupid stuff? No not at all, there already exist some templates
  in COMPET-N/speed e.g. Anthe's lv24-48 or an "unbeatable" record
  from the master himself e1m4-024. It's quite amazing how many maps
  are possible in pacifist style. I only mention pa06 by Kai-Uwe,
  p4m8 (yes, the spider must be dead!) by the Tyson-expert Patrick
  Martin, p1m9 by Yonatan, pa14 by Istvan, pa09 by Peo ...
