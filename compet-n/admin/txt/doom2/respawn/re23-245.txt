  Description:  This is really fun to play! If you take it too slowly,
                the level is not only hard but impossible. The faster you
                play the easier this level gets.
                The -respawn switch really helps to achieve fast times here,
                this recording is even faster then the best time for plain UV.
                I like the -respawn 100/100 category -
                lot's of fun and action. Try it yourself!
