  Description :
  Just an initial efford - ok? This is my first successful try
  therefore it's quite amazing that I've scored exactly 100%.
  My estimation is that someday someone will play it well below 2 minutes.
  Btw:
  I like the -RESPAWN 100%/100% section, (have said this before:)
  in most maps it's a bit harder than plain UV, with more action
  and normaly it takes less time.
 
  > "What's about the 100% secrets?"
  Sorry, there are none.
