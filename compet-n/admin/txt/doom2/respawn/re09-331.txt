===================================
Description:
By now you'd think all the IWAD records are more or less well-optimised,
the result of half a dozen or more top-level players stretching each 
other's skill to the limit. But take this level. We've got one initial 
tablefiller from Rini Udlift, from 1997, and an Anders update nearly
a year later. And that's it. For some reason nobody came back to update
this one, even though Anders' record predates the introduction of the 
nm100s category, which gave us much better routes for tackling this level. 
Somehow this half point always got overlooked.

Can't say I knew about it either. I only found this at random, watching some 
old Compet-n demos for nostalgia's sake. Anders' play was hard fought and 
skilful as usual, but the route was extremely inefficient and it was obvious 
he hadn't wasted much time on the recording. And there was an unusal focus 
on safety, with some monster packs ignored entirely. So my goal in this run 
was to get the more dangerous weapons earlier, activate every monster trap
even if I didn't kill everything, and just in general try to treat this
like a nm100s run rather than a UV run. First exit was 4:18, then a 3:52. 
Breaking 4 minutes felt like an achievement but it wasn't a great run, so 
after coming back for a second session I managed this run. There's still some 
errors here - I miss the jump to the rocket launcher,  and somehow missed the 
switch by the blue key. But the monster fighting bits went well and it's a 
good time overall, so I'm happy with this. An IWAD single-level record beaten 
by 1:53, in 2013. That feels pretty good :)
