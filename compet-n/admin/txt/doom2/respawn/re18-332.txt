  Description :
  Yes, poeppy's -Respawn route is MUCH faster - thanks for this improvment.
  I think this is definitly more fun than hunting for the lost imps in
  plain UV 100/100 - but no one seems to agree.
  Btw:
  Now I've beaten poeppy using the same route, does that mean I'm alraedy
  benifiting from the new controller config?
