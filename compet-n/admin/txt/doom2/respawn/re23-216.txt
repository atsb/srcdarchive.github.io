  Description:  this was a real tough one. but at least
                it's another 6 seconds faster. the run
                through the 6 painies is very bad, but
                the nicest part follows at the rocket
                launcher, 3 shots while turning fast,
                3 dead chaingunners. now try to beat
                this one rini, viel spass! :)
