  Description:  it's unbelievable how my health never dropped below
                93%, but i was alway able to restore to 100% before
                the next hit. :-)

                i think i took at least 10 hits in this demo, so i'd
                love to see someone playing this -respawn without
                taking any damage at all. that person must be the
                ultimate cornerinspector! :-)
