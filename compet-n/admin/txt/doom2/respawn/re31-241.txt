  > Hi Adam....plz improve this one (:
  
  Okay, no problem :)
               
  I really knew that -respawn is easier than pure maxkills so I pushed this
  under my lv31-248... Dunno why I played for two hours and get 0.5 point,
  but nevermind. I don't know who wants to break this and have 0.5 point
  where there are easier points... So I'll quit playing this map and search
  for another one... :)
