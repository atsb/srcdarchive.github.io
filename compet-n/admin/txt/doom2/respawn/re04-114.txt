Description: Just something I did before Seinfeld.......
             
             Like this map btw...lots of action and fun, especially with
             the -respawn option. Think it's possible to do this below my
             uv-max time, shotgun ammo is a problem in respawn though:) 
             Took me about 15 min to do this....
