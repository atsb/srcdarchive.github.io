  (Items   100%)
  Secrets  100%  and Time  05:20
                           -----


Description: in my 7:08 recording, i played it rather safe in
             the rocket launcher area, where i chainsawed the
             demons. this is now fixed, i'm rocketing my way to
             the bfg. :-) looks better and it's alot faster.

             this level is extreme hard with -respawn _and_
             going for 100% kills and secrets, 'cause you have
             to visit many rooms, and there are so many demons
             and cacos that you can't just run by.

             someone completely crazy could give it a try on
             nightmare with 100% everything...
