  Description :  In my initial re11-345.txt I wrote:
                 >> I think this is a nice map for really exciting
                 >> recordings. Let's wait for someone playing this in 2:30.
                 And Thomas Pilger wrote in his re11-334.txt:

                 > I dont'even know what the secrets are in this map...
                 > I just hate 100/100...

                 Now my comments:
                 I just have to repeat myself -
                  1) this is a nice map for really exciting recordings.
                  2) it can be done in 2:30
               
                 To you Thomas:
                  Don't bother about secrets, there are three, but need to
                  worry, just take my route and go for 2:30 ;-)

                 ... and this definitely will be an exciting recording!

PS:
   I wrote alot of things in the re11-345.txt, I'd like to add some
   comments on them:
   >> Pacifist
   >> Yeah! This is a new mode of doom playing - the "Pacifist" style.
   >> This is completing a level on UV without harming any monster.
   >> There already exist some templates in
   >> COMPET-N/speed e.g. Anthe's lv24-48 or an "unbeatable" record
   >> from the master himself e1m4-024.
  
   Now that I know the reason for Steffen Winterfeldt's "godlike" playing
   style I would not call him "the master himself" anymore. In addition
   Yonatan has managed to beat the e1m4-024 by two seconds.
  
   >> It's quite amazing how many maps are possible in pacifist style.
   >> I only mention pa06 by Kai-Uwe, p4m8 (yes, the spider must be dead!)
   >> by the Tyson-expert Patrick Martin, p1m9 by Yonatan, pa14 by Istvan,
   >> pa09 by Peo ...
   >> But no one has succeded in pa11 so far!

   This is no longer true, Thomas Pilger has completed pa11!
