Description: Hmm, it was very easy beating "Poeppys" long standing record
	     from late -97. I got 03:20 after first try so I had to get it 
	     below 3 min. I'm sure it's possible to come up with a better route
	     but hey, you figure it out :)
	   
             Hmmmm that will be another 0.5 to Norway, think I'll do this
	     with the -fast option.
