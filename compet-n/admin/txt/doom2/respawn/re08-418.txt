  Description :
  I've suggested this one as a real challenge for -RESPAWN 100%/100%.
  Poeppy showed, that it's not that tricky as I thought.
  Anyway - there are many parts which can go wrong ...
  The major error I made in my first tries on this map was to visit
  Cybie to early. The central room always gets crowded by barons
  if you do so. Second error was trying to get the backpacks. That costs
  lot's of ammo or lot's of time or both ...
 
  Now to this recording:
  First I don't chainsaw the baron because this takes too long.
  Then I follow poeppy's route and luckily escape the respawning demons
  after getting the BFG. Then to get the necessary kills I go to the
  30 imps-room. Next is the painie-room. I tried to get out of there as
  soon as possible, but I got stuck and nearly died in the lava ...
  Then visit Cybie and got stuck again - and again it was close to death.
  On the way to the red key card I improve my kill ratio and maybe I'm
  wasting some time on that, but you never can tell before ...
