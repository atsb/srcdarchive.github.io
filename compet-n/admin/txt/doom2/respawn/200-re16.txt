Comments: Rini said this was theoretically possible, so I wanted to do it. 
          This LMP was the result of about three hours work as many things 
          can go wrong. Sometimes the imps in the room next to the MegaSphere
          room awake and bother you. Then the main problem is getting the
          blue key without being hurt in the slime or by the imps. Then if
          you're careful you can easily get to the invulnerability without
          being hit. From there the problem is making it last long enough
          for you to raise the red block and walk onto the exit without 
          being hit.
