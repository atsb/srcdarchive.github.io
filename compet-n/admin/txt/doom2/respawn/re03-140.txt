Description:	In the beginning I thought this would be a hard one to beat, and
		I was right...........then I started to use almost the
		same route as Panter. This made it all very easy! When using
		this route, I only needed a couple of tries :))

		This was my first finish with this route, and fortunately it was
		better than Panters record. I guess it's possible to get 
                through somewhere around 1:30.
