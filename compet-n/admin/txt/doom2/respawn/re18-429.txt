  RE18-429.LMP - Ultra Violence with -RESPAWN

  Recorded using Doom2 Version 1.9
  Doom2 -PlayDemo with Version 1.9

  Doom2 - Level 18 - The Courtyard

  Kills    103%
  (Items    50)
  Secrets  100%  and Time  04:29
                           -----

  Description :
  I think the -RESPAWN with 100% Kills and 100% Secrets section is really
  worth notion. In some maps this requirement is much harder than Nightmare
  or -FAST. You don't believe me? Play MAP08 -RESPAWN with 100%/100%!

  Back to this map again ;-)
  First I've played it as in plain UV and ended with 140% kills in 6:04 :(
  Then made some minor adoptions to the changed requirements and ended close
  to my best time in plain UV (4:22) and -FAST (4:39).

  BTW: I'm sorry for the jerky manouevering :<
  1) I'm not used playing on a 486 any more
  2) I need much more practice with my new controller configuration.
