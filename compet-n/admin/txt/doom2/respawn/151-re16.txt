  Description:  well, i'm no demonlord, so i have to do it the
                slow and save way.

                the question is when to take the invul: before
                the blue keycard to cross the acid lake or
                afterwards, so it can last the rest of the demo.

                i took it first and i'm not quite happy with
                the result: scratching imps. juck!

                for me it's vital to have the bfg, and if someone
                could manage to get the bfg and make it to the invul
                without taking damage, we may well see a 200-re16.lmp
