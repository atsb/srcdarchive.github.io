Description: Hmm, Rinis 13:39 recording of this map wasn't that hard to
	     beat. I knew it could be improved a lot and so can this, but I
             don't bother until somebody else does it... 
             
             Btw, I ran out of bfg ammo in the red key buliding without that
	     mistake it would have been below 5 min :(
