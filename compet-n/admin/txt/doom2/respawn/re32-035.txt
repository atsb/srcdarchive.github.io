  Description :-)

  I felt like improving my previous entry by some seconds, and so I did.
  Now seven seconds faster than Rini.
  
  My older route wasn't getting 100% when speeding, so I changed it to the
  good old plasma version. 
  
  -Respawn should be easier than maxkills, and so it is: the only annoying
  thing is to get 100% kills... And sometimes cybie bothers you a bit, but
  that's rare. Here everything went perfect so I'm quite happy with this one.

  Enjoy!
