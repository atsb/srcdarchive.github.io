  Description:  Hip hip hurra! Today I finished this map on nightmare 8-)
                Beeing familiar with the respawn patterns in this map now
                I decided to make another entry to the Respawn 100/100
                category. It's much easier than on nightmare and the
                100% secrets are no burden with -respawn. It helps you
                against ammo shortage. (Watch my 001-re04 entry in which
                I end with no ammo and have to box the last demon :)
                The supershotgun also is useful at some places.
		I even kill every monster at least once - so the time
		is very, very improvable.
