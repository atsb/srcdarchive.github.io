  Description : 

	What do you think of the time Fx ? :)
	A brand new route... quite easy to get >100% with it.
	my first tries had 115% kills in 4:00... so i improved a bit :)
	leaving some monsters, especially bigger ones :).
	My main goal is to kill a lot of imps... so i go to their place 
	just after getting the BFG and just before going the the end room (cacos).

	is <3:00 possible ?
