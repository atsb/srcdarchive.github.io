Description: Hi "Rini", after finishing Quake2 for the first time, some hours
             ago, I downloaded some new Compet-N entries...
             Hey, I just had to defend my levels (:

             PLZ Rini, try it again, <1:30 is possible.
             
             Btw: This Level IS fun with -respawn...but really don't like this
             100/100 shit...
             I had about 5 tries to do this (-:
