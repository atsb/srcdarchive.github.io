Description: Just had to defend this 0,5 point, I wasn't very tried after
             the lv04 max so after watching a late movie I was looknig for
             something relaxing to play...no need to rush here. Heh I don't
             no if I was just lucky or something but this is the first time
             I exit, I did have a few other attempts before this one but never
             hit the exit switch...so I wasn't sure if I killed too much or
             less.
             
             Wanna play this further on Zvonimir?
