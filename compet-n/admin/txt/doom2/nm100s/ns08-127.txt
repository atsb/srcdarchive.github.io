  Description :-)

  OK, I used Zvonimir's new route here. As you can see, I don't even switch
  to plasma at the first demon-scene... you can get out nearly always without shooting.
  I also did some other parts faster and I could save 1 BFG shot for the exit.
  
  Around 1:22-1:23 would be more like it.
