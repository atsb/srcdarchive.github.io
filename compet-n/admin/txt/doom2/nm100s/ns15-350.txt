  Description : 
	Nice route Sedlo, I had some problems with it though. I've compared 
	your route shown in 4:23 with this in nomonsters and it's a little bit 
	faster than this one (3 secs), but I've found this lot easier, it's 
	much more precalculable, using the teleport to get behind the red door, 
	always resulted some totally random things (usually bad things) for me: 
	the shotgunner and zombieman stood in front of the elevetor blocking my 
	way to jump down to use the teleport, when I entered the teleport with 
	plasmagun no imps were in front of me, but when I used bfg, there was.
	Using the red door is a bit slower, but LOT more safer... 

	I've recorded this at work, no sound, and win nt server with dynamic 
	mouse sensitivity in dos prompt, the most annoying is when you start
	the map, and you'll make the first turn, you'll end with a random 
	direction, you can see at the beginning what I'm talking about, that 
	mad turning nonsense is because this nice feature. :/
