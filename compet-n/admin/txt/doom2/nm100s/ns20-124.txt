  Description: A fairly simple route improvement here, you don't really
               need a supercharge so I just skip it and jump directly
               to the imp passages. This saves four seconds, I only got
               two off the record though as leaving that health
               behind does make things a little tougher. Included a 1:26
               on the old route just to demonstrate I'm not relying on a
               cheap route improvement.
