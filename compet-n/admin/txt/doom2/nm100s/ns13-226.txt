                Henning, did you really thought that you can take a point from
                me eazy. Try this a little bit more. I leave you enough space  
                ( for example that jump to chaingun secret only that give
                  you 2-3 sec. and the moving isn't that good ) so improve it.
                You sed that this is possible under par and you were right,
                I say that this is possible even under 2.20, future will show
                am I right or not.
                Can you do it ???
