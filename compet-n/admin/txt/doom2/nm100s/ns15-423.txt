  Description : " HE-HE " -part 6 ( finally the last one )
                
                Well, when you read this probably you realizied that you
                didn't take a point from me. Never and remember "NEVER"
                let you take a single point from me in this cat.
                Don't think I forgot about map20 and 27, soon I will take
                them back, too ;))).

                Now something about this demo. First of all it was really 
                funny watching your demo Henning couse Istvan already
                mailed me ns15-448 but he never upload it.
                In that demo he show me new route but I had my own
                which I made before two weeks (I think).
                So Istvan this is it, mail me what do you think about it and
                suggestion how to do surten parts faster couse I will go
                for under 4.00 (yes, I'm sure it's possible) and I respect
                your opinion in this map. Oh, yes Henning when you beat eny
                record from me, put it in incoming so that I can take it back
                immediately. Don't collect like now 6 of them.
                Enyway how are you feel now when you realized that you
                waste your time ;)))))))))))).
