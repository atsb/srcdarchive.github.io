  Description : Nice map!
                I hope that this is the best route but enyway thanks Istvan.
                First I started to play very carefuly and in my first
                try I did 2.32. As I played more and more the time came
                very close to 2.00. This is actually first time I did under
                2.00 and it's the first time I skiped invisibility.
                In this one I played very risky but when you want
                a good time you must risk a little. Still there's a few 
                mistakes in this one so this can be improved.
                Around 1.45 would be great here.
