  Description : Uffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff !!!!!

                What a relief ;))))).

                Thanks Istvan for bringing me back.
                Last few days I stopped playing Doom2, I don't know
                what was wrong but everything looked so boring.
                But today when I saw new demo the old desire came back.
                Now I feel great ;))).

                Hehe, I'm sure that you didn't expected 20 sec.
                improvement. Your demo was nice and route wasn't that hard.
                So I change one thing. Now the route is super hard but it's 
                also super fast. With this one I'm sure that under 3 mins.
                is possible. Hmm, this is first time I exit with it.
                Sounds funny, couse I needed 3 hours to make it ;))).
