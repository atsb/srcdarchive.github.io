  Description :-)

  As Sedlo told, his route wasn't optimal so I made some
  changes. Most noticeable is that I used the newer Ilya route
  at the start.
  
  Because Sedlo told that he will defend all of his NM100S
  demos I don't expect to get a point out of this map, he'll
  beat me anyway. At least I showed a new route.
  You know, I've been playing this game for 2 years now and
  I realized that I don't have the time and motivation to
  do long DOOMing sessions just to get another point.
  I'll leave that to Sedlo and all the new guys.
