Description: The main problem for me was getting the blue key since i strafe
             only with MB2 (no circle strafing), plus crappy mouse and quite
             low framerate (eh...what??? :))) Still, i got a 1:57 in my 5th try
             and this came after some 20 tries. I think i should be quite
             satisfied with this lmp :)

             Oh, and this seems to be my first Doom2 entry :-)
