  Description : Hmmm.... i was trying to beat my Dang time (0:35)
	        i though : "why not trying to do that jump on the rising ledge ?"
		here it is ... my first try... :) everything went perfectly 
	        the pigs didn't block me neither in the pit nor at the end.
		Maybe i lose 1s in the end room...

		n.b. : only one sec away of nm record... :) i tried to beat it
		       but i couldn't :((... i think i was extremly lucky :)
