  Description : I watched Sedlo's new entry for this map, and I didn't liked it.
	Sorry Sedlo, I don't want to blame your entry but, it looked very 
	sloopy sometimes. This is the same route you used, I didn't explored again, 
	where are the secrets, and what is really neccesary, just tried it for fun, 
	and got this time...
	I watched Hennings respawn-skill 4 record too, which also looked weak. I 
	tried that one too, but on skill 4 are too less bullets for me :)
	Come on guys you can do it lot better :)

	I hope you all hate me now, and you'll beat the shit outa my entry next time.
