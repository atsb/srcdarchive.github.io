  Description : This is at for me the bigest suprise in this style till now.
                I thought that this will be super hard at the begining but
                after my first try I change my opinion because I survive
                till exit where stupid cybie kill me. I checked that demo
                and the time when I die was 3.17. For this score I needed
                20 mins.( only wanted to do this under 3 mins ). 
                I create this route while watching that demo from
                Rini I think. It's much better than the old one.
                This demo is just fine until I came in exit room and
                there was again cybie ( I hate that stupid *********** )

                and nocked me down. You will see that for
                a moment I stoped. Damn in that moment I didn't know if I'm
                still alive or not and where the hell I was.
                But like a rescue I heard sound of teleport what meant that
                cybie was gone, man what a relief when I press that switch.  
                Hmm, this map really don't have optimal time I think.
                Around 2.40 should be great at least with this route.
