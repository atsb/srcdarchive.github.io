Description : Hey Marijo, you will sooner or later accept my challange 
              in this cat. So her is my version of this one. It is Real hard
              to optimiz this cat...in certain maps it isn't possible like 
              this one :) Not even map01 I think...remember you can run almost
              perfect map01 in 6 sec..but as you can see 5 sec is possible. 
              In this map you have to run for over 1:30 min...there is no way
              such map can be optimized....maybe a speed run under 30 sec
              with A LOT of tries can get perfect without cheats but not maps 
              like this. You can be lucky and get very good times and sometimes
              you will keep the record for a long time maybe for ever because 
              your demo was really good....but it isn't perfect :)
              
              Anyway, about this lmp...I did a few shortcuts in a strange way. 
              There are a lot of things that have to work....not getting
              stuck...killed (duh)..falling down....forgetting a key etc..
              so this is the first time that I reach the exit with a decent 
              time...maybe 01:29 will be hard to reach and that would be 
              a good time...but hey there could always be a better route,
              and there always are :)
