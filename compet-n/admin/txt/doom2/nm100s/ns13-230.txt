Description: Think under par is very possible. First time I hit the exit.
             I invented a new starfe in this demo. Quit hard yes, espessialy
             with crazy lost souls around. Once you get the second invul with
             the useless chainsaw you can strafe directly to get it :))
             This saves not much time but it looks better and ofcause you save
             some seconds.
