===================================
Description:

I changed the route from the previous record for avoiding to be blocked 
by pinkies. First of all, I picked up a BFG quickly after I got a blue key. 
The trap shutting in the BFG's room was avoidable easily. You can leave it 
until a ceiling is closed. Secondary, I didn't pick up a RL. The RL has 
already been almost unnecessary because the possibility of being obstructed 
by enemies decreased. This run was comparatively smooth.
