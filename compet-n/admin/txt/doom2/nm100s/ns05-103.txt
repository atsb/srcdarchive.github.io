  Description:

  Henning's demo was quite easy to beat so I
  tried to improve my original 1:07 demo. I
  used an agressive route here, but the demo is
  still improvable because I made a mistake with
  the door. I've had demos around 1:00 where I
  missed the final secret so 1:00 should be a
  good time. I'm not sure what's the best way
  to deal with the blue armor room; I tried
  this route with fist which may be faster but
  I'm not sure.
