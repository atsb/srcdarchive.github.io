  Description : Heh, this is one off the real ns maps.
                You can forget about speeding threw this map, belive me you
                won't came to far. Only way to play this one is carefully
                and killing every monster on your way.
                This is second time I finish. First was 7.48, hmmm, 
                only 8sec. improvement but never mind I had enough off
                this map for today. I must leave space for enybody who
                wants to join me in this cat ( Henning ??? ).
                Come on folks, whats up...
                I don't see that you play this cat 
                and there are still so many maps to improve.
                Don't let me do that job alone ;)))).
