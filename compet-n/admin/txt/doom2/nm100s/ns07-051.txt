  Description :-)
  
  I was thinking that my last NM07 was good but not quite enough,
  plus I saw some improvements to my old route, which made me try
  this again. I made the mancubi part much faster than last time,
  and I used rockets for the arachnotrons, as many as possible.
  This helped my do a 0:52 after some dozens of hours :) but later
  I did a run where I died in the exit and if I pressed the switch
  one gametic earlier it would have been a 0:51. This made me very
  angry and I tried more and more. This one came quite hard, I had
  another 0:52 and a 0:53 meanwhile.
 
  Finally this run, I'm satisfied with it now, although there is
  still room for improvement. 0:50 is definately possible, even
  0:49, but the latter needs more luck than usual.
  
  I don't think I'll go for these times, think this 0:51 will prevent
  anyone from trying. Even though the mancubi can help you and you
  have more ammo, don't even think NM is easier than UV!
  It's not -- anyone under 1:00 in NM can receive my handshake.

  Now my 0:54 with -fast is the slowest of MAP07, as it should be,
  because UV -fast is the hardest way to play this map. Maybe I'll
  improve that one some time, because it seems slow compared to
  the other times.
