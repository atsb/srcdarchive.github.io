	It took me 30 min to get this crap.

	Jump? What f.c.i.g jump ? As you can see I had so much luck
	that I fall down (it happens me once on 100 tries) :(((

	Well, this time I didn't activate the line at yellow key, becouse
        I was watching with Marijo "Panter's Nightmare" movie (nice movie!)
	and I said to Marijo : hey, how he didn't activate the line ?
	and he laught a lot ... With this trick it's very easy to end map.

This one goes to `Super Marijo "Cocadeamon" Sedlic' : ns05 ..., try ns08 :)))

I'm boring but this goes to all of you, doomers :
	PLEASE, DO NOT MAKE, OR ZIP YOUR *.LMP, *.TXT IN windows BECOUSE
	THEN THEY HAVE small caps AND I CAN'T EXTRACT THEM WITH nc IN dos.

	ThaNx fOr ReadiNg!
