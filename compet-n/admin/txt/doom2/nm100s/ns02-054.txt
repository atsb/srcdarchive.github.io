Description: Hmmm....Istvan did 0:59...and I said "Well...no problem...he can
             have this one"...then Baum phoned me saying he equaled him...
             And today he phoned me again saying he equaled Adam's 0:58 (which
             I haven't yet seen)...
             So...just to prevent Baum doin' 0:57, Adam 0:56 and then..say
             Istvan 0:55 I did this...
             Anyway...no more fights in this one for me...I won't go for any
             new nm02...so everybody feel free to do a 0:53 (and Baum...feel
             free to equal 0:54 :)

             Btw: Yes I was a BIT lucky in this attempt...but the nm02b054 was
             a bit unlucky...so it's ok I think.
