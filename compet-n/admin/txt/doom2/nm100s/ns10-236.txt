  Description: This was very easy, and I'm sure someone who wants to spend
               some more time on it will find it not too difficult to 
               get a further 10-15 seconds off. My running is fairly fast
               except for some clumsiness on an early unhelpful imp, 
               and too many rockets to the face while invulnerable. Nice
               exit, can hear the whoosh of a Cyber rocket shooting towards
               me :)  Route credits to Henning.
