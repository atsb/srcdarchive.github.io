  Description :-)

  Improvements? Under 1:00?

  I see 3 possibilities for route improvements:
  a) not getting the chaingun. Getting past the demons pacifist
     style is much harder but may be possible.
  b) not getting the invisibility.
  c) not getting megasphere.

  Both three improvements in one run could do a 0:55.
