Description: This new cat makes this level EVIL, the first part until you get
             the supercharge is were most of my tries end, if I then make it 
             to the invul the rest is easy. I have also been having some 
             problems in the end too, but you just have to be lucky here. 
             I would guess 01:41-42 is extreamly good here. 
             I have been trying to use another route here, and I'm not quit 
             sure yet what route will be the best? I leave it with this route
             for now, I will try other soultions later if someone beats this.
             
             heh, anyone wanna skip the invul.....hehe guess not :)
