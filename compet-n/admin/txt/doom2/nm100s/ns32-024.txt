  Description :)

    Well I don't know how to get a 0:24,
    maybe someone else does :)
  You get it using sr50 :D, but you still need pretty damn good running
  
  I tried this a long time ago in May 28, 2009 but settled with 0:25.83
  back then, and never speedran it again untill today
  Now I tried it again and the goal seemed easier after more experience
  and skills' improvement, it took 2.5 hours, about ~8 good attempts that
  were possibly 0:24 were ruined at the end by one of these possibilities:
   1. BFG not killing all keens
   2. rocket only hitting close to the last keen and thus not killing him
   3. stuck on the last keen's dying animation at the end
   4. Trying to avoid being stuck on the last keen but instead I try to
      avoid him overly, miss the white platform and thus fall over the red
      sky floor

  Highlights of the run:
   When getting the SSG secret, I open the wall from the nearest side then
   rush over the secret from the left side which is nearer to the cyberdemon
   It's done brilliantly for this particular secret

   At the beginning of the run, I sort of glide the green pillar, you
   should turn on slow motion to see it :)
   In DRE, the distance moved is like this:
    #94 22.986740 (SR50)
    #95 23.041429 (SR50)
    #96 32.079705 (SR50 + gliding the green pillar)  
    #97 42.398697 (SR50 + gliding the green pillar)
    #98 23.176344 (SR50)
    #99 23.213254 (SR50)
    So it saved about 1.5 tics ;)
   BTW, the same kind of boost is in Sedlo's e3m2-012 with a tree
   Ocelot a while back told me about that boost and to watch it in slow
   motion when we were discussing e3m2-012 which I think is the best movement
   demo out there. Sedlo's time is 12.97 with no SR50 at all, and his demo is
   full of smooth movement and elegance, the fact that that tree boost was
   necessary for his 12s makes it awesome!
   For Comparison
   Andrey Budko's TAS time with sr50 in e3uv-315 is 12.94
   Akse's TAS time with sr50 in e3dq-310 is 12.74

  Enjoy!
