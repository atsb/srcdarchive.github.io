  Description :-)

Nice run Janne...but would you please record some harder DANG demos so your
%age compet-n goes down? :)). This demo is just a bit more reckless, running
faster through the start of the level. There's a few messy bits, I backtrack
in the first secret to make sure i've hit it, and I think this run could go
under 1:00 if it was _really_ pushed. Bonus for this demo: I die on 0%...I
got shot as I was running up to the porter, thought "OH FUCKING SHITE!" and
then a massive grin spread across my face as I slid into the exit...:). The
route was copied from Janne, don't know who invented it.
