Description: This was a great map to play on this style...I really enjoyed
             myself..I started at 05:55, as I got faster (bringing it
             down to 05:04) I had to do something about my weapon usage.
             Don't think my weapon usage is optimal...but I dunno why you 
             guys are running for all kinda stuff...rocket, supercharge,
             exstra blue armor, another green armor....come on guys you get 
             more health power-ups in the archo uofficial sercet room..
             + berserk and megaspher in the exit buliding....you have
             to REALLY fight for your life for every inch you move forward :))
