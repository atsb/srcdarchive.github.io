This record is sponsored by SPA!

Originally, we were trying to break MAP31's record on 2P Coop. After lots of tries, we decided to give up, and to move to MAP32's.
Problem: We got the WR for this map on UV, so we tried to beat it on NM.

Luckily enough, we've beaten it with lots of troubles, and with a huge luck for the Cyberdemon.

JCD, you're the sickest dude ever! 10 seconds! It's UNBEATABLE now! \o/ 
Also, thanks for the SPA too! :D

I THINK it's unbeatable ... but who knows ?
