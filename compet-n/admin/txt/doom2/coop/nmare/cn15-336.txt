Vincent: Not so good, basically a one player map. So I played safe.
         Got a nasty surprise from the cyber when opening a door.
	 I almost gave up here... but when I seen I was still alive, 
         I tried to reach the invul ... rather lucky there :)

xit-vono: I didn't do much here.  Vince should have taken player 1.
