Pl1 ---> Well, it's not possible to entirely controll the Cyber by yourself 
         so the only possible and none luck-depended way of doing it would
         be to reserve one player to "control" him ..and it worked quite 
         well this time ..so we didn't bother to redo it again :)

Pl2 ---> 1st exit by Henning. My role is quite boring but it's absolutely 
         necessary to get cybie out of the way.
