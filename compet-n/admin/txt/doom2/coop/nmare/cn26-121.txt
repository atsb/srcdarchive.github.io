Description:
***********

Pl1 ---> A pretty straight forward map that don't really give much room
         for coop play, espessialy not when you're having a cyber who can
         virtually hit anything he desires in the main hallways.
         Still I think we did the only coop split possible or at least the 
         only none-crazy one :) 
  	          
Pl2 ---> nothing for me here, except trying to survive and scoring secrets.
         I still remember having DF on my back saying "Vince is fucking up                           again!"
