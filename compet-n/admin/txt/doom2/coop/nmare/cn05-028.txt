Selim   : My task didn't require amazing skills, so there is not much 
         say. Talking about the effect of color in the russian cinema 
         would be a lot more interesting, but I doubt anyone wanna read 
         this. You guys don't know what you're missing :P
Vincent : 1 sec off my record, but we've not spent much time on that.
          25 secs is theorically possible.
