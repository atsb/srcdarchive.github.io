description:  Beaten Adam Hegyi here.
              Considering Adam plays twice as good as most other
              DooM players, we did a good job here.  :)

               

------------------
Admin note (Ralf):   Hmm, the last usetic is at 35.00, the second but last
                     at 34.97. Actually the 34.97 one exits the level so i
                     think it's okay to say 34 secs for the lmp.
