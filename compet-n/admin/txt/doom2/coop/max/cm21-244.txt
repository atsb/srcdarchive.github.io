---------------
Admin note... more than two years after the demo was made :)

When checking this demo by inserting a SG1 tic before the demo ends and
loading the savegame i found two living Lost Souls.  Nothing wrong with
that but one has a very strange behavier, it shouts like a Demon! Huh??

Time is actually 2:44.00
