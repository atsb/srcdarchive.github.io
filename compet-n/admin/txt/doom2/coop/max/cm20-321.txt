(Green)Description: Almost half the time of the current "100/100" record,
                    AND there is a bonus Cyberdemon. That has to be tele-
                    fragged. Dasa fires quite a lot of plasma cells in my
                    back. There are 2 Monsters left, both Lost Souls, one
                    of them behind a wall. I think we've got 91% kills.
                    You can make 100% if you let the Archvile revive some
                    Imps or Sergeants. He _Has_To_ revive at least one of
                    these because you don't kill the Spiderdemon (or the
                    Cyberdemon).
