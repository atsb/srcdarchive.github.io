Comment:     I already did this map on uv-speed, nm-speed and for Pacifist...
             So I persuaded Baum to do this map too..(-:

             Well, Kai and Sven hadn't done this map, and so we really had no
             plan.
             I thought I had seen this map already done with a nice trick
             to kill cybie...
             Hey ! we're happy we made it...it's much harder than it looks..

             We're 44 sec. slower than the actual max-record, but we had an
             additional Cyberdemon (and we run out of ammo and health all the
             time).
