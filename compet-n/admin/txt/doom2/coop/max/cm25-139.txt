Comment:     In contrast to K&D we had a real plan (:
             hmmmm....ok there was a little problem in the end ):
             We didn't kill 4 (5 but one was killed by another) monsters in
             front of the blue door...
             Archie helped us to reach 100%...This **** engine doesn't show
             this but it would have been 100% for the maxkills category...
             
             CHECK IT if you don't belive us...(we analysed it for OVER AN
             HOUR)
             THIS IS DONE WITH 100% KILLS !
