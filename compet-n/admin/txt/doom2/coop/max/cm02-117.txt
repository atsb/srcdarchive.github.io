comments: The stats screen showed only 86% kills,
          but there really isn't a single monster left
          alive. If you see any alive monster, tell us and
          we will kill him next time. But be sure the time
          is faster then!


-----
Admin note (Ralf):   Yep, all monsters seem to be dead only the counter is
                     a bit out of order, I never saw such a low kill count
                     in a coop demo.
