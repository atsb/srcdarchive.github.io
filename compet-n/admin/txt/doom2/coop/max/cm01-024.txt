Comment:        One of the easiest maps of course. The deathmatch weapons
                help a lot. It would have been a 0:23 perhaps, if I hadn't
                missed my left turn and waited therefore at the plasma gun.
                And to kill the Imp at the exit requires some distance, I
                can't kill him fast with a rocket. But this .lmp is good,
                OK?
