Description :-)

Looper:
Yay! Under 3 minutes. With low ping it wasn't too difficult. Only reason
I kept going after the numerous failed jumps (I never get it right in
multiplayer) near the spider was because the beginning went so fast.
Sure the run can be done faster but the old record was 9:08... eww!
Other than the jump, the run went just as planned, at least for fx.
It was pleasure to play with him.

fx:
First exit was 3:40 but many times we made it around 3:10 so we  decided
to go under 3:00 :) I think this route is still far from optimal but you
will need strong nerves and patience to play.  Maybe there is some other
route or trick to go through this map.  Looper is good coop player, nice
teamwork, strong nerves :P Really close to beat 30uv coop run, 2:58 :)))
Enjoy the demo and I hope more demos will come from two of us. :)
