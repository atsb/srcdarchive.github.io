Comment:        As usual, dasa has all the ammo (backpacks).
                and that's why I've got the megasphere.
                Only a little gap to the solo record.

Admnin note:   Time is actually 0:42.17 :). You must have had a slow
               watch, this is the second demo which is 2 secs faster
               than you claimed.
