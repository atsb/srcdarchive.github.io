Dark Friday:  This map generally went ok.
              <Anders> demos?? What demos?? huh? :)
              <Anders> you played coop I guess :)?
              Nope no coop, that green dude, that's arno, a disguised imp
              which offered me his help :)

Imp:          We didn't have a time to beat here so we just aimed to beat the 
              solo record and getting under 2 minutes. Didn't use my fireball this time. :)
