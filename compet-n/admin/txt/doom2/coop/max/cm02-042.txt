  Description :-)
  
  [ Waldon: ] 
  
  Oh my God, what a massacre...
  Now Waldon can give back that plasma package,
  he has got.
  (If you didn't understand the previous sentence,
  ask me about my nick)
  
  [ Adam : ]
  
  The main improvement here is that we used the
  cell pack as much as we could. My route is
  pretty much a speedrun route, while Waldon
  gets the cell pack and plasma gun, so he has
  lots of cells to play with. This way I can
  speed up my part nearly as much as in a speedrun,
  and we still manage to kill all the monsters.
  Btw, 90 monsters killed in 42 seconds, I think
  that's nice :)
