  Description :-)
  
  [ Waldon: ] 
  
  I should have some luck in this demo...
  Three rockets/mancubus isn't a good thing,
  the arachnotrons died quite fast at least.
  Maybe if we will have some damn much time,
  we'll try to improve...let's make it optimal.

  [ Adam : ]
  
  Damn, this took quite some time...
  We set the goal of doing this under 30
  long ago, but we needed a couple of weekends
  to manage it. This doesn't look like optimal
  and it isn't, but I think it's a nice run...
  especially compared to the old 0:42 by Kai/Dasa.
