Dark Friday:  Ok map, the begin is hard due to the chainers and the sg-guys.
              But as usual i get stuck here and there, and as usual this demo
              ends up in the zip. Figures ;)

SlagDooM:     Why isn't that bfg in the start room?? :)
              Anyway, beating another Kai/Dasa demo.
