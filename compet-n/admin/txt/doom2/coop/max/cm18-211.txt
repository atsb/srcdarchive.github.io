OgreSlayer : Not that good. This is just a table filler. Was a fun map for
             coop max, but this will be improved easy I'm sure.

Vincent : This map had no max entry, so we make this...
          High ping makes player 1 aim quite crappy, but still it's 1 min 
          under solo, so I guess this is an honorable time.
