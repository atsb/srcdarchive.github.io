  Description :-)
  
  [ Waldon: ] 

  Well, after the first hour I simply couldn't do a perfect run,
  so it took me another two hours to make it. But finaly... :)
  I recommend to see the standing "dead" Imps at the end.

  Hmmm this was quite hard... we got 0:18 after an
  hour of play, but decided that we should go for
  something better... Needed 3 hours to get 0:17,
  something always went wrong, we had 18.02 with 100%, then
  17.xx with 96%, but finally we made it.
  0:16 is optimal IMO, but it takes two MAP01 experts to
  make it *hint* *hint*.
