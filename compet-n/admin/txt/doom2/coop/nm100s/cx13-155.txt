Pl1 ---> Again a nice coop split, this is one of those map where you never          really run out of new coop possibilties, I had the easiest route 
         by far, credits to Vincent for making it even more easy :) 

Pl2 ---> Henning goes for the route while i get the secrets outside and 
         lure the cyberdemon.
