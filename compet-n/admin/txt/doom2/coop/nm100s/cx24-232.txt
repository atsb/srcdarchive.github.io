Pl1 ---> This is one of those that didn't really deserve our time :)
         It sucks ass to run on ledges 4-5am in the morning, however 
         though I still belive that we did "ok" under the given 
         circumstances ;)	

Pl2 ---> Crap part from me, i'm not a ledge master but i must admit 
         that player 2 doesn't help.
