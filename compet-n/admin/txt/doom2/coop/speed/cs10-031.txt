  The time sucks (probably because I played as pl1), but still
  better than last record. Nice map for coop btw.

  [ Bolton: ] 
 
  I didn´t "coop-ed" there so well and wasted few
  seconds of your running insted of saving them
  (waking up spiders that block your way laters
  and being slow with blue doors opening).
  At least we enjoyed the playing :-)
