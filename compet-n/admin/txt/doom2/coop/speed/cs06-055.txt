  Description:
  
  [ Bolton: ] 

  Radek´s job saved about 3-4 seconds there, I was very lucky with
  both of those jumps and I expected something like 0:53 maybe faster.

  [ Radek: ]
  
  Bolton showed his great running skills and the time is just
  1s slower than Henning's speed. I think if we'd had some more
  time for coop, we would have done it.
