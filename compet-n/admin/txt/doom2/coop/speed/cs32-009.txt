[ JC : ]

Yeeeahhh! was my first reaction after seeing 9 =)
It was really hard, over 2 hours of training to understand how the thingrun work ...
We had several times 10.11, then 10.03, then 10.00. =D
Very good teamwork !

[ Ch0Ww : ]

For a run that thought impossible to beat, we've been able to learn something : to break the records, break the physics !
It was so fun and challenging, that we have both been proud of it. 
Really nice job mate <3
