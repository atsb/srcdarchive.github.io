  Description :-)
  
  [ Waldon: ] 

  It took us "some" time to make this one.
  The route is optimal, I think, but I would like
  to see this record improved. What did I say???
  Never mind! This demo rocks. BeAt It If YoU cAn.

  Well, this time was very hard to get,
  and I believe it's optimal with this
  route... Someone could beat this with
  Jonathan's rocketjump... but then it
  wouldn't be too much need of two players...
  
  So if you want to beat this better try
  beating lv03-023 first :))
