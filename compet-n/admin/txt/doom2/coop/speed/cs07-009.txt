Description: This is my first Coop .lmp I've done. I've watched nearly all
             recordings at cdrom.com but nobody had used or had at least
             mentioned this trick. Although there are only points awarded for
             coop 100/100 I upload this. Maybe someone is going to invent
             a coop-speed too. Fortunately there is a Misc. Directory.

             I think I should be proud (: to be the first(?) one who adds this
             nice trick. Now its possible to run (more than?) twice the normal
             speed in coop.
             Don't know if this is also possible with enemies but works with
             SShotgun (as you see) and Rockets.(BFG?)               

             I would be happy for some Feedback

 
             23.10.97 ...hmm... Maybe it was the 19.10.97
             Took us 1h and was the first time we reached the exit [:
