Description: Well...just another one for the (soon available?) coop-speed
             category. This time without any stunts. 9s improvement to Kai's
             solo-time and just another reason to invent this category (:
             
             I had some problems with the last imp and I didn't use Kai's
             trick (taking the yellow key without firing the BFG).
