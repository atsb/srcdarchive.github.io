  Nice working with ya N.C., I'm looking forward to doing some more
  coop stuff with you in the future.

  [ N.C.: ]

  Well, one late December evening (or early morning, perhaps more
  precisely), Ocelot asked me if I was interested in trying to improve
  a certain co-op record from a couple of years back. Since it turned
  out that the run would need us to perform a trick, involving me
  blasting Ocelot full force in the back with my SSG (I never get to
  do that enough when deathmatching him), I decided it sounded like
  fun. And it was.

  This is, by the way, my very first Compet-N effort. When we might see
  the next one, however, I really don't know...

  Anyway... All in all, these lumps required about 45 minutes of work.
  We started by taking a glance at AdamH's and Sedlo's 6 second effort,
  then practised the run in -nomonsters for a while, after which we
  moved on to the real deal. Eventually, we ended up with this 5.71 sec
  run. We played over an emulated IPX connection courtesy of the MSN
  Gaming Zone, and our ping at the time was approximately 20 ms.

  Enjoy.
