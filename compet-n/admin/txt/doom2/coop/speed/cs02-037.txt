  Description :-)
  
  [ Waldon: ] 

  We tried several different tasks for Laura and this one
  seems to work best. She takes the supporting role while
  I run for the exit. Pretty good job from a new speedrunner
  - though we will improve that with some more coop practice :)

  [ Laura: ]
  
  In a way it is a mild clusterfuck regarding exactly what I 
  should do in the beginning. Theoretically if I could manage
  to get a shotgun near the red key area, I could help get
  the monsters out of Waldon's way faster. Its not possible
  to do consistantly though, as waldon's route usually makes
  him run through where the shotgunners were, collecting the
  freshly-dropped shotguns as he passes. Getting the
  chaingun was my idea, the rest of the route was Waldon's
  plan. I guess we're lucky Waldon knows how to speedrun, at
  least one person in a coop demo should, eh?
