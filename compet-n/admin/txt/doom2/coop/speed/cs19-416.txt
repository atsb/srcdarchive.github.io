Comment:        A bonus Cyberdemon, heh. Nothing to worry about.
                The BFG and the Rocket Launcher are fairly far away,
                and the SSG too. Dasa had to hurry with the Invunerable
                somewhat :). We meet as usual at the exit, nice huh?
                First we were afraid that it will not be a good time in
                coop for this level, but as you can see, there is always a
                way to make a short .lmp in DooM ][. Most of the Megawads
                don't support that, eg. because monster teleport somewhere
                one by one (and in your back?), they run straight to the
                other corner of the map... Maps > 15 minutes are somewhat
                boring. And if you have to awake 95% of the monsters to
                have a weapon >= 5 or SSG, it's not the way I like it.

-----------
Admin note:   Time is actually 4:16.11 but unfortunatly you forgot to kill
              quite a few demons.  So no Max point but it is a valid Speed
              demo.
