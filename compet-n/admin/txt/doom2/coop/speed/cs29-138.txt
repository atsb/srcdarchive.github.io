  [ Bolton: ] 

  Jaromir´s comments aren´t present -> out of CZ now, so I´m 
  including my view in peace :P You should certainly take a 
  care of that and press F12 key to find out where his lazy 
  ass is lounged at the moment :P In fact he did a cool job
  for me there, did screw up minimum and managed to survive
  til the end. It was me who ?ucked up great run at FJS place,
  ehm ... twice I think. All in all it took about 3 hours
  of dooming and we put it under 1:40 which was our goal.
  This ins´t bad at all but I stand by Vinc with "there could
  be a better use of cooperation".
