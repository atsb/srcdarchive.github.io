Comments:        We had to think about the best solution to some problems.
		 Like saving health for the runner.
		 So I took some monsters down on the most important places. Like that one 
		 chaingunner up the 2nd floor. :) that one is a health sucking bitch!
		 And Selim does the excellent running.:) He must have nerves of steel. :))

		 Only 3% health left here!!!
