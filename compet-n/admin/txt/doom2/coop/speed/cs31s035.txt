  Description:
  
  [ x-jack: ] 

  One of my first single player demos ever. Here i was doing 
  live shield to Radeg to his safety run. Fortunately those 
  SS guys are lame ducks so at the end i stand alive, 
  see that :)

  This was fun to play. Xjack had to work as my domestic and defending
  me at all cost. I was a bit nervous at the end, coz Bolton was
  staying behind Xjack and shouting at me "hurry up, hurry up, he's
  dying!". :) It's definitely in my reach to do 34s, but we were
  short of time. It's also a pacifist run.
