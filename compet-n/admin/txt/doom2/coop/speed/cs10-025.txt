  When we were working on this, I was 90% of the time the one
  whose fuckup ended the attempt. Thanks for bearing with me
  N.C.

  Well, this one took a bit longer to pull off than the map07
  speedrun we recorded yesterday. We were obviously going for
  a time faster than the single player map10 ultra-violence
  speed record (26 sec), since anything else would have been
  rather pointless; after all, a team is supposed to be faster
  and more efficient than an individual, isn't it?

  My role in this run was to help speed up Ocelot's running
  by opening a couple of doors, as well as slaughtering as
  much riff-raff as possible. As always, pure fun. This is,
  by the way, a 6 second improvement on the previous record.

  We played over an emulated IPX connection courtesy of the
  MSN Gaming Zone, and our ping at the time was approximately
  20 ms.

  Technically, this really wasn't one of my better attempts
  at this run, but at least it did do the trick; Ocelot made
  it to the exit in 25.97 sec. Good thing I didn't hit Q after
  I had...

  1. accidentally bumped into a trooper,
  2. had to fire my peashooter SIX times in order to kill a
     sergeant,
  3. missed an easy sg-shot,
  4. missed a stimpack I intended to pick up (while I was run-
     ning around with 67% health in a potentially quite lethal
     environment indeed).

  Enjoy.
