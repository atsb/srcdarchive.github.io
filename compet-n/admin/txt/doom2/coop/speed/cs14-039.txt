  Wow, thats how I imagined reel COOP, I just hope if somebody
  is gonna beat it, he´s gonna use the routes we do, rocket
  jumping would be nice but this is much more fun believe me.
  If you´r wondering what we are trying to do at the "bluedoor
  jump" platform so I tell you then. Jacih is not good at this
  jump despite of its dificulty - easy, I wanted to raise
  up with him to help it by killing those blocking shotgunners,
  at last moment he sent me to hell with something like "Get 
  out ?ucker" leaving me down to pray don´t let he screw it up 
  all while he showed precise performance and his fast ending
  brought these nice 39 seconds :P
   
   
  PS:
  These days Jaromir is surfing in Dennmark, so his comments
  will not been added, but he thinks we both rocks in this one :P

  PS#2: You should surely watch both of the views ...
