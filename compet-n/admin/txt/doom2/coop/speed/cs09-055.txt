  Hmm ok, we didn't optimized this one too much. But the time is pretty
  good I think....like in lv07 you should watch Adam's pov...his part was
  extremly hard and he handled it very well.

  This one we didn't play too much, definately possible in 0:50 or even better.
  I suck at the yellow key demons, don't know why, in single player they
  are much easier. Start could be faster too...
