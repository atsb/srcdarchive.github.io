Description : 

Radek :
  We wanted to complete all the episodes sooner or later. This came pretty quick, the time is 
  acceptable for us. Could be still improved by 10-20s, but that needs playing on LAN.

Vincent :
  That was the next thing we wanted to do after the 30uv. I didn't think we could improve
  the previous time by almost 30 secs !!! 
  I hope the next episodes will follow soon :)
