 Description:

    After our 10 level recording we made some minor modifications in routes
 of the first 10 levels. The result is approx 4 minutes faster... so we hope
 you will enjoy this movie!

 green player words:
   I'm new in the coper game, so some minor mistakes may occur yet.
  Thanks for Mr. Gorila (Laszlo Magori) and deity for the help. 

 indigo player words:
   I'm quite satisfied with this one. Times are great, and it also looks great.
  -level 6 : By some luck I realized all of the jumps here.
  -level 7 : 47 sec on nightmare, cool , quite close to our best. (45)
  -level 9 : It was just too quick... Gabor doesn't reached the health bonus
             so level 10 become quite though for him. (down to 13%)
  -level 12: The end is so easy comparable to single play!
  -level 14: We don't have a real coperative route here... :(
             If you have some ideas about better cooperation, mail us!

  -level 17: We have a solution for this one... not like we showed in this lmp,
             but both of us made some BIG mistakes here, I don't want to 
             discuss them... and NM playing doesn't admits the BIG mistakes.
             Anyway this level is much harder than on single play!!!!       

             
  We choosed to upload it because level 17 is quite hard so it may takes some
 time while we finish it with a better ratio, and while we practicing the rest
 we give some movie for you to watch!
      
  Watch this, from both player point of view, and wait our next movie!
