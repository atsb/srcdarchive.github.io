Description :

xepop : Long time project finally done. My part is pretty easy as I 
don't have to do any hard tricks. Still, I probably screwed up the map03 
jump more than Looper did map07 and map14 together. First 20 maps went 
pretty much on "autopilot mode" and usually mistakes happened because of 
wrong or lack of reactions to changes. For example here I have 200/200 
in courtyard and went straight to megasphere because that's what I 
normally did. In this demo we had pretty good two first episodes but had 
problems in couple maps in the third one. The Chasm didn't really go as 
we planned: ~ 13s lost there I think. Then we had this awful Monster 
Condo. Normal was 21s or something and it rarely failed but here it 
happens. I couldn't save it as I haven't practised luring archvile there 
but with some luck I managed to do it eventually. Plenty of room for 
improvement of course but anyway, first human's to beat doom2 under 20 
minutes on uv! 

Looper : Yeah it was a long project. I blamed lag many times when I 
failed a trick even it wasn't true, hehe. Map04 ending jump is just 
random imo, so I hate it. If someone wonders what I did at the yellow 
key at map12, it was a lagspike >:(. Map14 rocket jump is hard if you 
don't know what angle and how to start the 'launch' but after figuring 
that out, you just have to hit the wall with the rocket, which was hard 
sometimes when lagging like hell. I wish map24 had gone like in plans 
but it's very difficult with lag as minor mistakes are often fatal. Good 
thing I didn't kill xepop with bfg in map29. There were few maps where 
everything went better than expected. The run went fine excluding maps 
06, 24 and 27.
