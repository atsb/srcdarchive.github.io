Description :

xepop :
We set 4:59 for our goal. I thought it's ambitious goal, but possible 
indeed. Our routes are heavily based on Radek and Vincent's coop runs 
and the coop speed records for individual maps but with some of our 
preferences. I think the next ones to run this episode probably needs to 
come up something faster for Map07. That and better running in maps 06, 
09 and 10 should yield 10-20 seconds. Funny moment in map06 though I'm 
sure Looper cursed me couple times for that when playing :) 


Looper :
It was hard to get under 5mins but we did it! Some little mistakes here 
and there but this time should be hard enough to beat.
