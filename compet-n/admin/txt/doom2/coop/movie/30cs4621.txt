==================
Admin note (Ralf):   Yeah, that's a great movie. Vincent plays cold blooded
                     until  the end of Map29  where he runs toward the exit
   losing health... and just made it with 19% through! His movements went a
   bit choppy in Map30  and when the final stats screen showed up i shouted
   with both of you: YEAH!
   Included in the zip is also the movie from Nicolas' view.  Nicolas was a
   big help in Episode 1 and 2, killing Cyberdemons and Spiders on his own.
   In Map21 to Map26 he takes some little breathers but jumps back into the
   action from Map27 on. Marines,you should have recorded your conversation
   at the start of that map :), should be very interesting.  The last three
   maps are most exciting from both views.
   What's next, D2dS? Doom2 double Schwarzenegger :).



...  after reading that Vincent spent some time to write comments for every
     level, read on ...
=======================





----------
Comments :   Our main goal is to get a max of cells and bonuses like
----------   supercharges, blue armors and megaspheres.

Map01 : Nothing to say except that's the weaponry. The plasma gun
        can be grabbed with the jump, if we fail we can get it in map02
        with the red key.

Map02 : One player makes the clean up work to make the other's life
        easier.

Map03 : I go for the switch, nicolas goes for the secret.
        I nearly died here (3%).
        Maybe he should try to get the back pack in a future demo...

Map04 : I accidently stole the supercharge to Nicolas...

Map05 : Solo map iwth a bonus invul.

Map06 : I missed the first jump...
        Nicolas kills the monsters that appears just after the jump.
        Some probs in the Red key room.

Map07 : Well... only killing...

Map08 : Nicolas goes for the key, I keep the door opened.
        Enjoy his method to find a way through the barons... :)
        (better from my view)

Map09 : I do the normal route, Nicolas helped to clear up my way...

Map10 : This route is very slow but allow to get two supercharges
        one blue amor and one berzerk.

Map11 : Nicolas fired on cybie to allow me to jump to the red key.
        Then he took the invul and finished the level.

Map12 : I kill the Mancubi because both players must get the yellow
        key to enter in the last room.
        Then 3 switches for me, 2 for Nicolas.

Map13 : I do the route. Cybie got in the way of Nicolas, sadly for
        cybie, Nicolas was invul... rest in peace cybie ! :)

Map14 : Nicolas killed Archie before I opened the red door
        so i can take the normal route to get the blue key without
        too much pain.
        Congrats to Nicolas he did the jump to the blue door.
        I was really surprised !

Map15 : Bad map, I had probs to activate the switch from the acid...

Map31 : Carefull play, Nicolas was not very healthy
        So he took the invisibility and I made the route.

Map32 : A place to fill your backpacks with cells...

Map16 : I ate a SSG shot of Nicolas => down to 20%
        Hopefully there is a megasphere.
        Nicolas cleaned up the end (the imps and the revenants)
        so I only had to collect the keys and exit...
        I advised Nicolas to get the cells near the exit
        he didn't want so i did it.

Map17 : I got the red key, Nicolas killed the pigs and opened the door
        to the central room so that I could kill cybie.

Map18 : Solo map for me, annoying map for Nicolas.

Map19 : The route I took is only for one player...
        And there is one bonus cybie which is very badly placed.

Map20 : I did the acid route, Nicolas only waited for me to exit.

Map21 : I played solo until i reach the room with 2 switches
        and 2 teleporters.
        Because we tried to do the first part coop, but one player
        always ate some rockets.

Map22 : I did the route, Nicolas killed the chainies so that
        they don't annoy me.
        He could clean the end lift (revenant+chainies)
        but last time he tried he died...

Map23 : Nicolas killed most of the pigs with his brutal BFG rush !

Map24 : While i got the megasphere, Nicolas did the way in the last
        room with narrow ledges and the souls !
        Great job Nicolas ! I didn't have to do that hard job !

Map25 : Nicolas helped to clean some rooms.

Map26 : Nicolas hate this map...
        His help would be welcome in some scenes.

Map27 : We never did this map on UV, we discussed of the routes
        in the beginning.
        I let the first invul. to nicolas so i made the yellow key room
        very carefully.
        Nicolas killed most of the revenants that keep the red key
        so that there is only some Hell knights and barons.

Map28 : Cell collector for map29... so many invuls... you can't die !

Map29 : No diffrences with solo map. Coop helps a bit in some rooms.

Map30 : At the beginning we said : that's not a hard map
        but you can die easily...
        We missed many shots before killing the big boss...
