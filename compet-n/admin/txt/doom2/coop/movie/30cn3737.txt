PLAYER 1:

Hiho :) This was kinda fun...no...correction: This was bloody great :) I got
to play some Doom2 Nightmare for a change...and I got to play it with one of
the best NM players ever. I remember watching Istvan and Gabors 16nmnet.lmp 
long time ago. Great playing...great action. But I couldn't imagine anyone 
doing the 14 remaining maps in coop mode, not with all those bitchy cybers 
hanging around in map17, 19, 20 and 26. Well, the thing is - you do get alot 
more firepower in coop mode, but still, its harder to not screw up when there 
are two active players. Doing a single player styled coop with one inactive 
player shouldn't be that hard. But if you aim for cooping in as many levels 
as possible, then you've got quite some problems to solve. I think we have 
worked out some good routes here. Still, there are maps that have coop 
problems (like map11, 13, 20 and 27). Basically my function in this run is 
to kill as much shit as possible so that Mr. Skogsto can display a good 
portion of running skills :) I also function as cyber teaser in map13 
(not much success), map15, map17 and map26. In map17 my task can be 
frustrating since the cyber tends to be a bitch - hunting Henning for no 
reason. In map26 Henning got a rocket up his ass when exiting once, so its 
kinda vital to keep the big sucker occupied. In map22 and 29 I didn't get to 
do much at all this time, Hennings BFG's wiped the table. Usually I would 
have a tad more to do there...but, can't blame pl2 for being so effective :)
We did reach map29 once before this run...and I think we died in map23 and 24 
around 10 times. Map11 can be hard too, using our suicidal "ignore cyber" 
tactic. But it saves alot of time, so what the heck. Anyway, hope someone will
enjoy this run. We sure as hell enjoyed doing it. Dunno how much time we spent 
on this run really...we only played a weekend every now and then for some time 
now. Finally, thanks to Martin Aalen Hunsager, Vincent Catalaa, Arno Slagboom 
and Ocelot for inspiration - and Thomas "Panter" Pilger for some hints.

PLAYER 2:

Hmm well...this was fun :) I really think this is the best way to both enjoy
and play this game. After playing alot nm in singel player mode, I can assure
you that its much harder to keep two players alive through all the
32 maps, than just run them by yourself. You really gotta do the best for
both yourself and the other one. Some maps cause more problems than they
usualy do, but some get easier. I dont know if the guys at ID had planned to
make doom2 so damn perfect for nm coop....:) It seems like they have been
putting alot of effort into the coop settings....I rarly see the opportunity
for such a coop play in the newer games like Quake, Halflife, Unreal...etc.
Anyway, I really dont think that there are alot of people out there that got
the same oppertunity as me and Anders have to make such a run. It may look
quit easy and flawless when Anders is blazing through the game...but it isn't.
He both got me on his tale and some scary cybers ahead...(map11,15,17,20,26)
And these things takes time...first of all you gotta have quit some
experience....things rarly go as you had planned, and both of us had to
come up with diffrent solutions on how to survive the next map, every medkit,
stimpack etc...is vital sometimes. (my map17 ending is close:)
We both tried to make it look as cool as possbile..:)))
We did experience some problems this time...I made a fool of myself by
not handling the bfg in map09, cause of this the coop play failed big time
here....damn I have never missed that elevator before :((((
So what's next? Well we gotta play some more coop at least :)
How about the udoom episodes? well I don't know them that well but I can
always find something to do...oh well, gotta doom on...cya !

Map comments:

Map01 - Grab all the weapons and prepear! :)

Map02 - We get to use lots of BFG's. This one becomes very easy on coop play.
	
Map03 - More cute BFG's...nice

Map04 - Those poor bastards didn't have a chance

Map05 - First really nice coop map. The invurnerability works great.

Map06 - Lots jumps as always...that spider can be a bitch. First strafe went
        wrong this time, but except that, we had no problems this time.

Map07 - To quote the inhabitants: "Ouch...what the hell was that?"

Map08 - Pice of cake...

Map09 - Damn...the lifts got messy this time :( A pitty, but...

Map10 - Easy to get a cyber rocket in the ass for player2. But this map rules
        for coop! Worked quite fine this time.

Map11 - Hmm...bad. Archi fried player1 :/ Cyber can really be a bitch here.

Map12 - Nice coop in the exit part. Pretty decent this time.

Map13 - Great run by player2...cyber almost got him in the end though. Strange
        guy that cyber btw...he seems to hate Pl2 for some reason.

Map14 - At first this one was messy. But we worked out a nice route. Player2
        got all jumps right on, and the lift thing timed.

Map15 - Cyber got PL2 a few times here...but most tries works fine.

Map31 - Nice running...
Map32 - Refueling time :)

Map16 - Not much to do for PL1...missed the timing with the lift in the end. 
        Nice run for PL2.

Map17 - We hate this cyber. This time he acted nicely though, and went straight
        after PL1. PL2 got some serious healt problems this time...but still
        got through :)

Map18 - Short and sweet. Some times we have to switch invulns here...but not
        this time. PL2 runs for exit - and PL1 grabs a 100 sphere, helpfull
        for map20.

Map19 - Very unpredictable cyber here for PL2 too handle. It got kinda close
        this time too, but not as freaking scary as it sometimes gets. Again,
        not much to do for PL1 (gotta clear some imps for PL2 when he is 
        squeezing through those candles)

Map20 - We hate this cyber as well. He makes it harder to consentrate on the
        Pain Element right before the stair-jump. Several times he killed of
        PL1...but not this time :)

Map21 - Nice timing with the 200% sphere lift...nice run by PL2. 

Map22 - This went w/o a problem...and infact, it usually does.

Map23 - Ouch. This can be tricky. Luckily we had enough healt left from map22.
        Again, a great coop map. 

Map24 - PL1 had alot of problems this time...and it looks bad. PL2 went 
        straight for the exit, taking the last ledges slow as he should. 

Map25 - Not a good coop made in general, but this time the revenant was gone.
        One of the PL1 taks is to gather all those garden-guys in one corner.
        Nice and healty run by PL2.

Map26 - This is probably the 2'nd hardest map in this run - right after map17.
        Cyber can easily kill PL2 (who is running for exit)...thats why we 
        use PL1 as distraction. This time, PL1 had some really silly probs
        with the lift in the secret though :) Great PL2 run again - no big 
        problems.

Map27 - The door closed after PL1 picked up yellowkey, and thats not a good 
        thing. This map is very easy though, so it went pretty ok. Vincent
        had a optional route here, but we didn't feel comfortable with it,
        it would have been faster though (get archi to open door).

Map28 - No problems, great healt / cell refuel for map29. Good cooping. 
        
Map29 - Oh well :) This is not THAT hard on coop. Of course, there are some
        luck based stuff (like PL2 running the last distance with 15% healt 
        left!). Its a pretty nice coop map, as we split up for the switch
        hunts...as well as killing cacos and stuff. The revenants didn't 
        respawn as fast as they usually do in the end. Good for us :)

Map30 - Cool :) Hey..do we get a split D2s title for this?? :))
