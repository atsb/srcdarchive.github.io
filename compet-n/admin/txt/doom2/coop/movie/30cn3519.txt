* Comments *

    Xit-Vono :Well this was kinda fun and didn't take too much work to finish.  Vincent came up with
              most of the routes for this demo.  Nice to take the record from Anders :PPP

    Vincent : We needed to meet 3 times in order to achieve this. Which means 3 days. We started with just 
              playing to see where we could get and magically reached map17 and died there.	
	      So we started to use Istvan's fillup.wad in order to figure out routes and get used to the later maps.
	      We kept all the demos that reached map07 and it makes a count of 50x 06nm or better.
	      Our previous best was a 25nm that was as fast as Anders/Henning, so we were rather lucky not to
              die much in the ep3 maps. Makes me the 1st Coop DS since I did the Coop D1S with Selim :)
            
* MAP01 * Route by Vince

So-so, a no-brainer map, as long as xit gets plasma and I keep 100% it's fine.

* MAP02 * Route by Vince

Not very hard map, but can get tricky with the gunners. 

* MAP03 * Route by Vince

Not so good

* MAP04 * Route by Vince

Pretty good BFG combos here, makes the map real easy ;) nasty SSG shot missed in the end. Credits to Panter for 
the pacifist combination. Xit was here as back up in case Vince fucks up (which happnes:P, sometimes both did too)

* MAP05 * Route by Xit

No brainer with a nice invul. Nasty fall off in the end.

* MAP06 * Route by Vince

No jump fuck ups, we chose not to do the exit jump in order to get the cells (and not miss this stupid jump too:)

* MAP07 * No Route :)

Rather good time, but still far from Andy/Henning's 0:24 :)

* MAP08 * Route by Vince

Easy route, not much to say

* MAP09 * Route by Vince

Nice coop jump, credits to Anders/Henning.
Had to wait for Xit to get the sphere in the end.

* MAP10 * Route by Xit

Xit got lucky with the pig pass :) BFG is very useful there. Vince just grabs a juicy megasphere.

* MAP11 * Route by Xit

Cyber trick is rather easy, very useful to allow Xit to jump to the red key.

* MAP12 * Route by Vince

Xit used the non-standard route this time (through the imps) but it doesnt make much difference.
Xit takes out the spideys or they tend to get in Vince's feet after teleporting :)

* MAP13 * Route by Vince

Mostly a solo map but Xit fills up pretty good :) We just hope that the cyber doesnt get in the way.

* MAP14 * Shared Route

Vince jumps to get the blue key as Xit runs to the red key. Then Xit can flip the red switch so Vince
can get the sphere and exit. Can get tricky at times.

* MAP15 Secret Exit * Route by Vince

Vince had lots of health so he went for the speed route. Xit just looks at Vince's screen :)

* MAP31 * Route by Vince

Not much to say, Xit just fills up. We chose to skip MAP32.

* MAP16 * Route by Xit

Xit finds the ending a bit annoying sometimes. Vince fills up and clears the invul.

* MAP17 * Route by Vince

Credits to Anders/Henning for the cyber distraction. This way he doesn't get into the runner's 
way. Sometimes the cyber wanders back in the center and that gets on our nerves :)
Besides that, it's not a real hard map.

* MAP18 * Route by Xit

Another no-brainer. Vince almost managed to get stuck once in a while :)

* MAP19 * Shared Route

One key each, good route that avoids the cyber.

* MAP20 * Route by Vince

Vince was glad to do the jump from caco+armor nest :) For Xit it's fill up time.

* MAP21 * Route by Xit

Xit's part is easy. Vince just gives a little hand.

* MAP22 * Route by Vince

Vince played rather safe because health was not so good. 
Xit is the chainies janitor (Vince's old method see cn22-109.zip).

* MAP23 * Route by Xit

Xit had a nasty SSG swicth in tricky situation :P
Vince cleans a bit and fills up.

* MAP24 * Route by Vince

Vince played safe again, but got scared a bit in the red key room :)
Xit fills up and prefers to let Vince mess up the end and the ledges :)

* MAP25 * Route by Vince

Xit cleans the megasphere room. Vince got a bit low on health in the end.

* MAP26 * Route by Vince

Xit does the nice cyber distraction, credits to Anders/Henning
Vince played safe (again... :)

* MAP27 * Route by Xit

Lots of health and invuls on the way, hard to die.
Vince gives a small hand and hides (heh coward).

* MAP28 * Route by Vince

Easy route. Fill up time for everybody, the goal is to exit with 200/200 and full cells.

* MAP29 * Shared Route

First time we ever reached that map in a full run (did practice it a lot with fillup.wad)
We think it's a rather good coop route but features some good glitches :)
Many nervous moments, Xit exits with 10% :)

* MAP30 * Shared Route

No luck, 2 pain elementals spawned in a row on Xit's floor. They were quickly taken care of.
1st rocket up, 2nd while jumping down and the victory rocket while going up again !!!
Strangely it desynchs with prboom 2.2.4 and Budko's prboom. 
The PEs do not spawn as they do under doom2.exe v1.9
