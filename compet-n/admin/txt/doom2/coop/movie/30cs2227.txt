Description : 

Radek :
  It was a big pleasure for me to join Vincent and make this demo. It took us some while, be 
  sure it wasnt that easy. We worked on it about a week or so, mostly in the evenings. Started
  off with times slightly over 25mins, but we got better by every run we recorded. We had 24min
  demo soon, 23min came quick as well. We both knew we had to do it under 23min, it wouldnt have
  let us sleep in peace otherwise. Breaking the 23min barrier was a great challenge for both of 
  us I believe. Dont forget we recorded it playing over Inet with ping around 100ms. That makes 
  me even more happy. I think the demo is definitely the best one we did. I mean, no big fuck-ups
  and we implemented all tricks we wanted to, except of map27 archie trick, on the other hand 
  map30 went perfect for instance. I wanna thank Vince for his effort in this movie, he made an 
  awesome job. It's the best coop player Ive ever played. Thats it, enjoy!

Vincent :
  That was a kinda fun and interesting adventure. We got the routes set up pretty quickly and 
  then improved a few things here there as we played more. This is by far our best run, no real
  major mistakes, a lot of small ones here there though :) I was glad to make the glide in 21 
  and not to fall in 24 (which happened quite often:) Radek played great all along.
  Our original goal was to get below 24 mins, but it quickly changed to below 23 mins. Note that 
  this is the only time we got below 23 mins, and it's even below 22:30 :)))
  Thanks Radek for giving me the opportunity to do this run with such a great player.
