  Description :-)

  As I thought, the berserk pack and the first invulnerability aren't
  necessary...

  Some tip for those, who want to go under 1:20
    -the first shot needed to start the imps at the upper platform
     ( not necessary to miss the imp like me :) )
    -don't shoot the caco because in the next room the pink will hear
     you and so you must shoot him
    -need some luck at the jump for the upper platform...  :)
    -can save some second's in the yellow key room, by starting the
     elevator quicker, you must run faster than the two pinks...
    -some luck needed to the exit from this room
