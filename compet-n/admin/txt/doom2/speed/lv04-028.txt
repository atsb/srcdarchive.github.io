  Description :-)

  hmm.... D2dQ beaten by 3 seconds :)

  I discovered the first jump (yellow key to switch)
  many months ago... but i couldn't do it with monsters around.

  I used a bit of Strafe50 but only for the jump...
  which makes it a lot easier.

  Else the run looks pretty bad... 
  Adam, your lump looks ten times better ! :)

  Optimal may be 0:25 ? My nomonsters time is 0:22
