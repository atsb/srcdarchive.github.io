Description:    :"Description :)                        "
                :"I've found a faster *funny* way ... :)"
                :"Istvan Pataki                         "
                :"deity@balu.sch.bme.hu                 "

                :Thanks to Istvan ;-)
                :But if you make it fast, make it REAL fast.
                :So that no DL uses the north wall making a 0:48
                :And no gazelle "running is my life" finds a little
                :improvement. It is quite more dangerous.

                :It's quite good (45,4 sec), so if anyone makes 0:44,
                :or tries to make it, he must be nuts. Really!

                Okay I'm nuts. But who has doubted it? Anthe has sent
                me some .lmps, and there was this direct jump. Why not?
                It is very hard indeed.

                Like before: had some 0:45, but tried further, so no 0:44
                but one 0:43 ;-)

                Someone who tries it without the megasphere?
                /built?
