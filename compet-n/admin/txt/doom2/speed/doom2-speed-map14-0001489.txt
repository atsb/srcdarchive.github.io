Description: 
Trick is discovered by Looper (BT14-009.lmp), and thanks to 4shockblast 
for letting me know how to do the the method used consistent. 

After finishing up my 30ev run, I've gotten back into some Doom 2, where 
I look for every possible small time save I can find for 30uv. After 
learning how to do this wall wobble I figured I'd take a look at map 14. 

Not sure if it will be viable for 30uv.
