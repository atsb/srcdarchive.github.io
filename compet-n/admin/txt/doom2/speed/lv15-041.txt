  Description :-)

  This demo isn't very good. I also have many 0:42's and 0:43's that aren't
  good either. But the new route I discovered makes up for the bad
  performance. Watch it and see!

  I used DKS in this recording to quickly turn. I hope it's OK, since it's
  possible to do this with the mouse too (?). If not, ignore this .LMP and
  take LV15-043.LMP, included in this .ZIP, as the right one.

  Admin.: Is it ok to use DKS? A note perhaps?

  PLEASE give me feedback!! I'll be very happy to get some!

[  Admin. Note :-)  It *is* OKay to use DKS (the/a DooM Keyboard [or mouse]
   Spinner) as it is just a "configuration device" and therefore *not* seen
   as cheating. The only(?) "method" that would be seen as blatant cheating
   would be hacking the DOOM.EXE...
