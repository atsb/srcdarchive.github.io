Description: The other three ways: -nomonsters -> 1:21 (perhaps 1:19)
             This way: -nomonsters -> 1:13
             Disadvantage: no shotgun/only 60 cells -> more luck needed
             for the mancubus and the pig and of course the (2nd) jump.

Additional:  Yeah S.;-), ONE minute faster (or half a minute ;-)
             If somebody could make it in half PAR ;-)
             Not me I guess.

[  Only Half ! :-) You "guessed" Wrong ! LV13-115 :-) - S.;-)  ]
