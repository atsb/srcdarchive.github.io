	     Hmmmm well it looks like it, infact I never got a 0:44 run but 
	     I think this is even better, now I'm sure 0:42 won't be easy...
	     What's also interesting is that I use another switch combination 
	     at the end, I don't think it's faster infact I think it's maybe 
	     abit slower..	
		
	     As far as I can see I don't actually damage any cacos in the last
	     room eigther so this should also qualify as a pasifist entry...
