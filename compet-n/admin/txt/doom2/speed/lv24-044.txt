Description: Well, I REALLY hate those ledges... It was the end for a lot of
	     my multiple Level-runs.
	     I saw the very old entry by DL who had 56sek, and I thought it 
	     is possible to improve this by at least 1 sec...
	     So I took exactly his route (the ledges before the demonroom)
	     After half an hour I had an unbelievable 47sec .lmp (give me a
	     mail if you want to have it...looks really great)
	     
	     Then I saw the new record (45s) with a better route...and I
	     thought I had lost at least 4 sec while waiting to teleport. So it
             should be possible to break his time...and it was (:

             DL...come on, give this map one more try...43sec iss possible. (:
	    
	     By the way...I don't think the ledges are the biggest problem.
	     In my opinion the scene with the second switch is extremly hard to
	     do.

             Oh, I also upload, my other entries (map 20, 21, 25, u4m3,
             25 100/100 and two coop uv single level .lmps...maybe sb. will
             invent this new categorie) which are already in ftp.cdrom.com, to
             this site... they are old but still not mentioned on this server. 
             I haven't changed any of the texts.

             I'm back (: with some more time to play Doom. Watch out for newer
             entries
