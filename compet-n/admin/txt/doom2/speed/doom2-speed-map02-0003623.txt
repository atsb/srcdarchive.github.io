Description: Believe it or not, it only took me 10 minutes of attempts to get this time.
I've practiced this map for Doom 2 All run, I have no idea why I decided to try an IL speedrun, but I did and this is the result. 
Maybe I should say I worked hard for this time instead, so nobody will realize you can easily get at least below 36 seconds.
This is an improvment of 3 seconds over previous record, I'm sure this can go further.
