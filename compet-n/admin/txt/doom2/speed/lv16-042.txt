Description: Nice trick isn't it ? :-) I saw it first in a deathmatch.
             So you can learn from deathmatch even if you are to play
             alone. Who said he can make it without invulnerability ?
             - Demonlord ? Give me that .LMP then !

             PS: I hate the spiral way without rockets.
