Description: Cool level to speed :) This costed me aprox. 50 mins of constant
             playing- but it was worth it. Ok, ok- so its only *1* sec faster
             than Panter...I'm sure 1.10 IS possible here.
	     
             Funny thing- I had many goes which I'm sure went faster than
	     this..heck; this one is full of mistakes. Anyway, if anyone
             decides to beat this, then I'll fight them for the next three
             months :)	     

	     My fifth Compet-n entry, hmmm....maby its time to aim for those 
             really hard suckers? I've notting better to do for the next years
             anyway...
