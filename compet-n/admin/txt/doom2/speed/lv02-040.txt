Well, as shown here, a bit better than that is certainly possible. This is
an OK run literally - absolutely every little chunk of the level went OK,
not great, but nothing fucked up, which is why it got the record. 38 would
be a nice time here...also be nice to do it without blue armour (certainly
it's possible). Running is very ugly - sorry, i'm playing under XP, it's
jerky and the mouse input isn't very smooth.
