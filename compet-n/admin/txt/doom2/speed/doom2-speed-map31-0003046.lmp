Description :-)

This one wasn't too easy since i kept dieing at the end 99% of the time.  Only had three successful exits with the other times being 30.86 and 30.77.
I have no clue how i got this time but i suppose it's better to be lucky than good :)

Sedlo, if you are out there and happen to be reading this, i hope you doing well my friend :)
