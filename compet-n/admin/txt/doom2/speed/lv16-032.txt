Description: IMO 0:31 is perfect (and something between REALLY hard and nearly
             impossible :)...
             There's only 1 improvement to Kai's route...I pressed the last
             elevator during the jump (-8.

             Kai's .recording lasted about 680 days...and I'm not DL...but, How
             is this NOW ? How many days do you need for 0:31 ? (-:
             
             btw: This is another map I changed back to Strafe 40...hehe
