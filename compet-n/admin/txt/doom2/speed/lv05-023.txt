Another implementation of the thing
glide that seems to be popular recently.
This is traditionally a trick specific to
TAS movies, since the RL is required, but
with enough luck, a monster glide can
apparently suffice.  Even so... yes, this
run is rather rough, so it's probably still
not optimal, but it's still amusing. :o

I included Sedlo's lv05-024, which is simply
amazing and I hate to see it bumped from the
tables because of this lucky+ugly run.  We'll
see if that situation can be improved in the
future.
