Description: Hi Ilya....(:
             Sorry, but I just had to do fill the gasp between 19 and 26 ((:

             0:52 is a very good time when using the old route Ilya...
             Well I improved it a bit...Speed-walls, not taking the RL and
             punching the last barrel.
             hmmmmm.. I think 50 or 49 is possible.

             This 0:51 took me 1 hour...
