Description: Uhhhhhh that last Pig saved my life...
             I don't know why DL had such problems with this map...it took me
             only 1/2 hour.

             35 and even 34 should be possible (-: (the last time I said this
             I got 3 seconds faster than the "fastest possible" :)
             
             My best time is 36.2 but this was my first successful attempt.
