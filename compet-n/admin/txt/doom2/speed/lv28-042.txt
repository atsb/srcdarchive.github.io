Description: Wanna make your LMP of your life Adam, do a 0:41, not sure
             if it's possible though. I'm not saying that mine is perfect.
             In this LMP there are some mistakes, but it's not easy to earn
             the requierd 0:91 sec to get it below 0:42. I guess with perfect
             straferunning, and wall running ++only killing one specter each
             time you pass the exit room will do the job for you.
             I had to try for 3 days to get this record, the main problem was
             always to get past the specters for the second time, this same
             problem occuerd when I did the nm-speed. You only have the 
             time to kill one of them. 
             Anyway this is ONLY 1 sec away from d2dq.

             Btw, finaly I got this map in every cat, think that's cool :))
