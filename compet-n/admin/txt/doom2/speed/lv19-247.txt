  S.;-) Widlake was right: the old time (8:25??) *was* WAY
  too slow. This is better, but somebody with better hands
  and a smoother machine (and a bit of luck) could knock
  5-10 sec. off this one. It only took me a day to cut my
  time from about 10 min. to this - 2:47; so I'm sure it
  can and will be bettered soon.

  Honestly, the hardest part of this was going around the
  first two corners: my machine, allegedly a 486/66 (4megs)
  is SO jerky that I had to make this playing at Low Detail
  and the screen at half size.

  Suggestion: I think you need to run across the bridge at
  the start to deflect the arachnotron from the front door
  of the gatehouse. If so, you could try saving time by
  opening the door to The Citadel when you first cross the
  bridge: this might draw the cacodemon and two lost souls
  out, and avoid spending time killing them.
