Description: Hey, Daniel, you should have improved my old record by more than
	     1 second. Here is my answer: 6 seconds better than yours. I got
	     fairly easy one with less then 1:00, but I thought I could improve
	     it furthermore. There are some changes in details: I leave 2 of the
	     first 3 heavy Weapon dudes without shooting them, and I use Chain-
	     gun on the Baron, because it keeps him out of the way. Sometimes.
	     And I had little luck to the teleporter (there was something down
	     there), but much after teleporting, because there was no monster
	     at all. I think I had 5 hours of recording now.
