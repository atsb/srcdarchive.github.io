Description:

  
>normally I don't beat someone with one sec.
me too (: 

>IMO 0:48 is perfect here, 
hehe....sounds like lv12 (:

>I won't go for it because it depends mainly on luck at the demons... 
Yepp, the demon-part is the most important factor in this map...
Just let some of them out and you don't have to punch them

If you compare this to lv23-049 there are many parts which could be done faster
(Strafebarrel-running, using North-wall-barrels, better tyson-skill etc.)

So...IMO 45 is perfect..(huuhh another lv12 d‚j… vu :)

btw: Adam...don't waste your time, improving D2Speed...go for D1Speed or NM..
     but D2Speed is my cat. (:
