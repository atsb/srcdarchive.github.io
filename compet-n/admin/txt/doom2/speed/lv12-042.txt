  Description:
  So, I checked what kind of record is here and it's really good one as a pacifist, but it was
  UV Speed record too, so 42 was only 30 minutes of work with the help of shotgun.
    First I thought that I gotta do this in 41 seconds because I got 42 fast, but
  I couldn't do it. I felt that this demo is pretty bad because it's not pacifist so
  I tried to do it in pacifist but failed on that one also. Now I give up because I don't
  really care about this map (Who does?). All what I can say to the next runner:
  Good luck with the demented elevators!
