Description: 

... thats not really possible now .. this LMP shouldnt be done !!!
I found my finger hiting the "Q"-key while those cacos fed me with
their bloody balls ...(?)... but when my monitor turn off from the 
red shade I decided to continue this game ... 
( btw. watch my healt there .. nice )
Thats first weakest part of the recording ...

The second one is by that blue armor. Respectivelly a little moment after 
I grabe it. I fell dawn from first ledge when raising and lost some  
seconds in tha slim ... in other hand .... I pickup the radiation suit that 
made me feel secure ... heh .. from this part Im playing for fun (just 
to practise the jump and some critical parts), I think theres 
nothing to lose now ... when I saw end_mission_screen I was paralyzed :P
1:46 !?!?!? Ive done a plenty of lmps without any mistakes and looking 
much faster ...the best was in 1:49, but why ? is this game so 
unpredictable ? or the monsters are naturally getting out of your way when
alls screwed ? :P             

Henning: Man ! You are expecting too much of me ...1:46 is enough ? :P
btw. again a bit closer to D2dQ time ...but IMO under 1:40 it must go !
