Description: I slightly changed DL's route...(Switch->MG->SG instead of
             SG->MG->Switch)..I don't like waiting for elevators, but you have
             to, so why don't kill some monsters in this time (:

             Very hard map when speeding....you can die almost everywhere.
             Took me about two hours...hmmm...maybe three (-;
