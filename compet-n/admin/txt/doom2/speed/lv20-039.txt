Description: This is my very first COMPET-N entry. (And surely not my last one
             :-). I found this new pointing system HP and I hope I did
             everything right when I uploaded the .zip.

             In the future I will mainly go after Damonlord's entries,
             because it's unfair to clear out someone who has just one or two
             points.

             Its possible to do this level in 38s or even 37s but I won't go
             for it. Once I had a 40s run but it didn't record. I took exactly
             the same route like Demonlord, just a bit faster.
             
             O.K. now somthing about this Level.
             I never had a worse jump in the beginning than this one. After
             that I was suprised to live. With pure luck I arrived at the
             first teleporter. Its strange that sometimes you get this with 20%
             and sometimes you die miles away. This damn little imp in the
             plasma room took me another second. Then a (nearly) perfekt run at
             the end.
             Took me about 50 tries to do so.
