Description: OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH YEAH !!!!!!!

             YES, IT IS POSSIBLE....

             I tried to get 5 sec. with -nomonsters and got it fairly easy...
             then I tried it in skill 1 and 2...and it also worked...

             Then I tried to manage skill 3, but gave up after 1 or 2 hours.
             BUT I realized that this map is easier in skill 4 than in skill 3
             (If you want to get 5s. :)
             Although there is one bonus Imp in the last room, it is less
             difficult to get through the first seargents...

             CHECK THIS .LMP !!!....I DID IT *W/O ANY DAMN CHEATS*....I HAVE
             NEVER AND I WILL NEVER USE THEM.

             If you don't believe it, TRY IT...and you may find out that it is
             easy to get a 6.3 or 6.2..

             Sorry Rini, no Pacifist this time.....BUT W/O BEING HIT (:

             Hmmm...the 2nd oldest Compet-N entry --- Next Stop E1M1


             HEY! YOU DOOM-PLAYERS OUT THERE...I WANT TO HAVE FEEDBACK ABOUT
             THIS ONE (:
             (sorry about the BIG letters...but I'm a bit excited :)
