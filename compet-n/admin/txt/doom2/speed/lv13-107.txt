  Description :-)

  I'm really sorry for Adam and Henning because they
  surely worked very hard for their runs... but they
  knew this could happen anytime.
  
  Anyway, I had to work hard too. About every 40 tries
  I get the grab once... and needed about 10 grabs to finally
  make it. Surely this is the hardest keygrab of all... I think
  it compares to some of the jumps/rocketjumps we have.

  Then, 1/2 of the successful grabs are stopped by
  that damned mancubus, I still can't find a reliable way
  not to wake him up. Then 1/2 of the attempts die at
  the jump to the blue door... not to mention all the
  other places where I screwed up. This is the 3rd time
  I got to the exit in 4 hours of play... there was a 1:11
  and a 1:08 before.

  Originally I wanted to do 1:05 because the trick should
  save 4 seconds in theory, but this route is really tiresome
  so I gave up after I got 1:07.

  So 1:05 is still possible, even 1:04 I think.
  Go get it if you want, it won't be easy... and it's NOT
  possible without the keygrab.

  Adam: you can still do 1:08 without any strafe50 to prove that
  Daniel's 1:09 is beatable without it :)
