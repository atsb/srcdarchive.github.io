             "Hey, Daniel, you should have improved my old record by more than
	     1 second. Here is my answer: 6 seconds better than yours."

             hmmmm Kai, I improved your record by 1 sec. (:
             Do you want to try a lv26-048 ? hehe...
             ...and Kai, you're right, the Chaingun is a big help at the Baron.

             I tried this Map for about 2 hours yesterday and I didn't get it.
             On Saturday I wanted to show to someone else what I'm trying to
             beat.
             I think I had this 54s. in my third attempt...
