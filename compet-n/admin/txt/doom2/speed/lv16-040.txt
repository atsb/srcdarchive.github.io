Description: Improved my own old record - or did somebody make a 0:41
             meanwhile? It's not quite perfect: two shots at the exit.
             There was a gap, but missed it. And two tries to get the
             shotgun. You can get a shell-box this way too... perhaps
             even the megasphere - but never heard anybody had got it.
             Oh... and it is rather close to 0:41. Perhaps one or two
             gametics ;-) Maybe because I looked at all the imps. But
             I think it is a nice exit view.
