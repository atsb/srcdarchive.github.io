Description: YEAH.....!!!!!!!!!!
             
             After ONLY 1 houer of playing I did it. Mostly luck but hell 
             this wasn't easy. Well sorry Panter but I'm not sure who told 
             me how to enter the rising bridge this way, but I got the idea 
             from Marijo's 0936nm01 run where he did it like I did here. 
           
             OK guys, I think this is optimal for me. I didn't get any better
             with nomonsters eigther. But I know 0:23 is possible at least 
             without any monsters. 
             
             HA, d2dq beaten by yet another second :)) and Demonlord beaten by
             3 sec. :))
