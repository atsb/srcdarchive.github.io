  Description :-)

  > hmmmmm.. I think 50 or 49 is possible.

  True ;)
  
  I got 0:50 fairly easy, but you know normally I don't beat someone with
  one sec... so I tried more. It wasn't easy but finally I got it.
  IMO 0:48 is perfect here, I won't go for it because it depends mainly
  on luck at the demons... So I leave that to Panter...
  Warning: my standard last sentence comes next...

  HAVE FUN PANTER !!!
