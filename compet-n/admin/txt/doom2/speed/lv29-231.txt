Description: Wow...much harder than I thought....
             This is one of the last 2 maps over 1/2 par time...so I wanted a
             2:30 (:
             But after 2 or 3 hours I'm very happy with this time.
             
             I'd really like to improve it a bit more...so, if someone wants
             to beat a map, please choose this one (-:
             hmmmmm I think a 2:15 is possible...
