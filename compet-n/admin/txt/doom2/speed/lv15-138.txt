Description: Quoting myselfe some houers ago in my lv15-145 entry:
	     > Well...time COULD have been quite ok, if I hadn't wasted that
             > last BFG-shot. Oh well...next ;)
             
             But then in thought: Why leave the optimizing to Panter?? 
             Took me about 1 houer...need a break now :) It can still go some
             5 seconds faster IMO.

             PS: If you beat this Panter- then its war...!
