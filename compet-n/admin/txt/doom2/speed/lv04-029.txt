  Description :-)

  Khrm.... D2dQ beaten by 2 seconds ;)

  This came surprisingly fast... 19 tries altogether...
  ...and the MMH is 41%... I think I had incredible luck...
  
  ...so it should be beatable... IMO around 0:26-0:27 is possible.

  Thanks goes to Vincent Catalaa and Kai-Uwe Humpert for the jump
  combination.
