Comments: Peo recorded this map in Nightmare! and 50 seconds, and suggested to
	  improve the speed record. I got a low 47, and thought that 46 will be
	  okay. But the 46 was a 46,1. Damn, now I was forced to play until I
	  get 45 seconds (Laszlo was right [lv28-045.txt]). I'm still stuck for
	  a few monents in this map, e.g. in the Spider room and it took three
	  shots to pass the hidden pigs. This time can be improved, I've got a
	  LMP where I reach the yellow door about 1,8 seconds earlier. The
	  problem is always that the more pigs you kill on your way to the
	  yellow door the less you're stuck when you return. BFG would be nice,
	  but no time to take it :-/. Let's play some Quake ][. I wonder why
	  they don't sell it here in Germany ...
