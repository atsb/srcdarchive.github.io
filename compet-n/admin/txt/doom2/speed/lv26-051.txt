Description: After my 54s. someone found a 53s. by DL (at least I think so)
             I just had to defend this map...(:
             
             The start is very slow...(in contrast to my normal starts)...and I
             really don't know WHY I beat DL's 53...
             50s., 49s. maybe even 48s. seems possible.
