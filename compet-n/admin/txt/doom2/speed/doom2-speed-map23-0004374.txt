Description: 
"Hmmm, 0:43 could be possible here I think." -Adam Hegyi, almost 15 
years ago since he did that demo (lv23-045), figured I'd try to drag 
more of the demons out to save time. My goal was 44 seconds, because I 
was never close to 43 seconds, and this was a very frustrating level to 
run. 

I was a bit unlucky getting stuck in that 1 demon, but I then got lucky 
with the 2 remaining ones. So, Obviously this can go even faster, but 
there is no way I would put myself through such misery and just hope for 
that amount of luck.
