  Description :-)

  Well... a little bit closer to perfection and equalling my D2dQ time...
  I gotta say 0:35 with this route should be between very hard and
  impossible...
  
  My run till the teleport is perfect... I never get 20% when doing the
  jump earlier (1st GT turn). A little bit slow entering the 2nd teleport,
  *very* lucky at the chaingunner+3 shotgunners scene (Okay, this is always
  lucky if you survive this at all). Perfect at the imp, little bit stuck
  on the 3rd teleporter. Perfect running till exit. Very close to 0:37.
  Tip for 0:35 madmen: try leaving the plasma, just cross the line which
  opens the teleporter and run back down the stairs. Interesting end scene
  with shot/chaingun only :)
