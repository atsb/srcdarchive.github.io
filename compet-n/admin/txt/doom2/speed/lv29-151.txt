Description: This is my first recording using my logitech mouse...damn
             I just love it :)

             Anyway....The "2nd hardest" jump in doom2 was no problem with
             it. So I decided to go for this speed-run. This map will never 
             get optimized.....and that's why I love it, because then there
             is no reason for me to let it go :)
