Description: 
Tried for quite some time to only shoot once at the shotgunners by the 
glide, but it failed so often and I never even seemed close. So I get to 
kill all 3 of them in 2 shots, which made it a bit easier, still getting 
hit a single time just pushes you so far off sometimes when you try to 
line up for the glide. 

Then there is all the luck with the barrels, and hoping you have enough 
health in the middle of it. This time it went pretty good, I think the 
glide can go a second faster, or more if you have some extreme luck and 
also manage to get the barrels later on.
