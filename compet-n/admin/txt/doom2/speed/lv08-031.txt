Description: I think the better way is with rockets and then pump through!
             But that can take around 50 seconds. So you have to hope that
             everything works:

             1) A free way to the yellow key (mostly on the right side)
                and back
             2) An open door (that's why I shoot the teleported Baron)
             3) A free way to the red key (not so difficult but it seemed
                to me that it is blocked when you got the yellow fast ;-)
             4) The "pig" at the exit has to let you get to the switch

             After 60(?) tries, I made it !
