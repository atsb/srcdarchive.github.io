  Description : Heh....before two night in "nightmare" sed that I'll beat
                one of Hennings records, so here it is. Hehe...Adam_mm2 you
                were right in first try what speed I'll go for...
                and Andy...you are week mind reader...:))).
                That night I started too late..."1:40"...so after just hour
                of playing I was so tired that I went sleep...anyway today I
                restarted with tryings, and I must say it was piece of cake...
                only hour....so all together, two hours...eazy for a speed
                record...:)). Anyway, I messed a bit picking of yellow key...
                stupid PE grabbed me...grr...but the rest was ok.
                Optimal?
                Hmm...my opinion..."nope"...but 30 will require much more than
                two hours...:))). 
                PS. Henning, don't be mad at me...I left you pacifist...:)))).
