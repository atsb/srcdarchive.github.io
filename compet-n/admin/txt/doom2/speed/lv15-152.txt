Description: Yep DL, you are right "A real pain in the as level"
             Taking the Invulnerability is a waste of time, because there is no
             use for it. (Maybe someone is afraid of the BFG-room :)

             This is my second successfull try, and in contrast to my other
             .lmps this one can be improved by at least 15 secs.
