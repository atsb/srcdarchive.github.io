Description: 4s better than "Demonlord" and 2s better than Uwe G. in his Movie
             21-30UV run...hmmm I think thats good enough (-:
             I had a 52 and half an hour later a 51 but I wasn't satisfied so
             I tried a 50. Maybe I undervalued myself (-;. 49s is a really
             great time I think.

             I didn't waste as much time as Mr. Lindgren with the seargants
             (don't know why he plays ping-pong with 'em :) and I missed the
             third teleporter. But everything else went perfect.
             48s and even 47s is possible...so maybe someone has got some free
             hours and a lot of patient. Sorry Uwe, I just wanted to get some
             of Daniel's points, but I overlooked your Entry.
