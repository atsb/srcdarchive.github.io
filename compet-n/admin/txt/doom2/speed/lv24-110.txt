Description: Less than half PAR. Anyone else also?
             Improved the record since the last update by 37 seconds now.
             DL's old record was a 1:56 and he improved this with a 1:47.
             Then I sent him a 1:30, and he replied it with a 1:17. Now,
             here is my new time.
             Had some luck with the lost souls, they need to look at the
             wall instead of attacking you. This effect was better shown
             seen in the LV24-130.LMP.
             I was not able to make it with less than 10 rockets. ;-)
             But without radiation suit, of course. (Lost 20% health).
             Killing the first 4 pigs with 3 rockets is not bad. The last
             pig escaped, but I've got 10 rockets. So 4 rockets for the 3
             3 left pigs, 2 for the 2 pigs on the other side, and perhaps
             one for the exit teleport pig, but there always seems to be
             a gap. And if you use an additional rocket, you have to take
             care not to be too close! Oh, if the pigs wouldn't block my
             way, I would let them live, but they do :-(

[  Admin. Note :-)  Not this time - except to say that the -NoMonsters
   .LMP doesn't really fit in here so I'll save it for another area if
   I ever get around to making one.
