Description: 
Just couldn't leave it at my previous time of 42 seconds, I needed to get that jump in.
Kinda wasted time on the spectre, but there was some infighting still going.
Fast glide, but then I had some bad luck with the baron, I had to run around him to reach the switch.
I was certain I wouldn't make it once I got past the teleporter with the health that I had, 
but for the first time ever the path was pretty much clear, no chaingunner on either side shooting,
revenant was dead and the spectres didn't get in the way and followed up by actually
surviving the last distance which was surprising.

36 seconds is possible if you jump straight down to RK room, but your chances of surviving 
and getting the jump is much lower, and you have to have a very quick glide.
