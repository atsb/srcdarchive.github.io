   ...and Time       0:45 
                    ------

Comments: This was nice, I expected a 0:48 but got this instead :)))
          Had some luck at the baron-scene, and it was nice to get that last
          yellow key jump w/o strafe50....which should be considered as 
          cheating IMO. 

          Okay, let's Doom on.......
