 Description: YEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHHH....over five hours work....
              I was wrong in my nm08-023.lmp...the Barons aren't the main
              problem, this **** Imps take the 2 secs.
              This was the first time I broke DL's record.

              Ok, it looks a bit slow with some mistakes, but don't even think
              about a 23sec .lmp (:
              This map is much harder w/o -fast.
