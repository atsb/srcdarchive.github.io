                Thanks to Istvan ;-)
                But if you make it fast, make it REAL fast. ;-)
                So that no DL uses the north wall making a 0:47
                & no gazelle "running is my life" finds a small
                improvement, which is even more dangerous.

                Made 3 * 0:47 lmps, but something went wrong in
                all 3. So I tried for a 0:46, making a 0:45 ;-)
                It's quite good (45.4), so if anyone makes 0:44,
                or tries to make it, he must be nuts. Really !
