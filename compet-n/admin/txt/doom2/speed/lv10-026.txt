  Ush, crappy run. Two flaws. First of them instantly after I shoot the two
  troopers out of the way. The return-to-the-straferunning-position -turn
  goes wide. An amateurish blunder. The second, even worse, flaw takes
  place at the exit. I don't have to explain, it's impossible to miss. :<
  I hope my next speedrun will be decent. :|
