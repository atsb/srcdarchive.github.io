Description: 
	     A bad lmp with a good route....Had two others on 48 and two on
             47. IMO 44 is perfect here...You don't gain THAT much by leaving
 	     the plasma behind. My time is reachable (but *not* beatable even
             when snatching the plasma). Wanna go for 45 Panter? Don't waste
             your time- it will only force me to do 44 ;)
