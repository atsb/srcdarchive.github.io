Description: I decided I would check out some doom 2 IL's, looking for
the smallest detail that can help me in my 30uv runs. However, lv02-037
did not use the glide so I figured from all the work I put into
practicing 30uv I could try improve this one. The quality of this demo
feels quite low, since this was my... 3rd or maybe 4th attempt, but
since I got an instant glide and the jump from the middle platform to
the exit area I figured it's enough for me. So, really shame about the
terrible start with not hitting the candle switch and not switching to
chaingun to deal with the chaingunner on the other side of the bars in
RK area. Instead I wasted time trying to hit him with plasma. Also some
time wasted on the chaingunners before the jump, but not as much as if
I would fall down.

So, maybe 1 minute spent on getting this demo, though lots of time spent
practicing (with weapons for 30uv) and very lucky with the glide.
Someone else should improve this even further as well as my lv02-036.
