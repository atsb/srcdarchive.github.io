Description: First of all..... Sorry about the end-screen it only
             appears for a very short moment, guess I somehow pressed
             2 times (haven't the slightest clue how it could happen)
             but if you concentrate you can easily see that the time is
             01.09..... I also sent a screen dump with this lmp if you
             would like to examine it further..
             This lmp is made with a strafe50 mousedriver so don't 
             even think of beating it w/o it.. The one and the only
             reason I used this DAMN driver (I really hate it, but
             the jump at 30 becomes a piece o' cake..) is because 
             the previous record of this level (LV13-113.lmp by Kai)
             is made with a such.. I have never, will never use it
             to beat any records other than the ones made WITH it..
             I'll never use it to make new records either..
