Description: Uhhh...just cleared out my VERY FIRST Compet-N entry....nostalgic
             feelings come up my mind (:

             O.K. now somthing about this Level. (I hate this sentence :)

             This time I took SG for the end (my Mingun turn was just too bad)
             but I still don't do that jump...
             There are still 2 more sec. in it...but this map is highly
             frustrating if you go for it...
