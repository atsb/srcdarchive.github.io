Description:  When I started to practise this level in speedy style,
              after a few tries I did 0.49. Then I knew it was possible
              to beat it. And then....
              I tried about 150 times. I missed the super shotgun or the
              shells or failed the switch-trick or the demons stood in my
              way etc. So it made me insane. But finally I did it.
              I think 0.45 is possible.
