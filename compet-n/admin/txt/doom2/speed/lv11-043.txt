Description: How is this, Steffen? No strafe 50, Anthe! (The jump is more
             complicate this way, perhaps I'm not so used in the strafe 40
             diagonal direction ;-)
             Don't want to try more, I think 4.30 am. is late enough.
             I don't know how to pass the Spectre, and I had some luck with
             the Arachnotron. Got a 0:33 without monsters. Much time for
             improvements. The problem is to get a weapon (fast).
