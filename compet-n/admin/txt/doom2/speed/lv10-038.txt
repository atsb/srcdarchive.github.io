Description: B F G 9000 ! It helps a lot to open one door ;-)
             DL said he would try to improve this level. So I improved it
             first.
             What could be made better:
             1) The sergeant should fall with the 2nd shot (or with some
                help) so you don't have to stop to get your shotgun.
             2) I made it all the way round a spider -> 0.5 seconds
             3) I didn't get the blue key through the door
             4) The BFG released late
             5) Missed the north wall and stepped back too much at the exit.

             So who will make it in 0:36 ? Should take some days. When you
             are REAL fast, the Cyberdemon will take care of you... Every
             time! Believe me!

             Think I will make an entry in /built for that level. Only have
             to fire my DX33 with some coals :-)

             Done! What time do you expect?
