Description: I must be crazy to beat my own .lmps...but the 2:42 was just too
             bad. So I gave this map a new try...
             As I said a 2:30 is possible, and I still see 5 sec which can be
             improved.
             ...and this time with a perfect jump to the yellow key. (:
