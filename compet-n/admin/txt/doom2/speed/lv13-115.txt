Description: This way: -nomonsters -> 1:10

             Tried almost one day to improve my 1:16 to have
             PAR/2 ;-) That was my challenge, PAR is too easy.

             Improved while recording in details:
             1) Turn to door for better opening
             2) Fire at pig demon earlier
             3) Jump from red key to the right (better direction)
                instead of to the teleporter (easier)

             Problems: Why does that platform for the yellow key
                       start so late. I had the same problem in
                       level 32 with the exit.
