             Nahh think it's my turn now :))             
             
             Around optimal time here should be 0:33 or something....
             The only thing that I can think of which will save 2sec at least
             will be to fool that specter guarding the first elevator in the 
             exit building. And maybe it's faster to kill him with two sg 
             shot's, but as we all know this dosn't happen very often.

             Hmmm anyone ??
