Description: I think Yonatan Donner was the first who recorded the
             button press that way (0:41). TZ did it in 0:38, and that was
             a fairly good time. During this session I had around 6 times
             the same time, then I decided to slightly change the location
             I use the BFG. You have to wait until the Baron comes out and
             hope that the Pain Elemental retires. No problems at the stair,
             that's why I did it that way. And, of course, the Imp in the
             secret passage way doesn't want to get in your way.
