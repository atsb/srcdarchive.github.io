Description: Welcome to the Level 19 Collection :). This demo has a bit of
             a history to it. Once upon a time (about two days ago) I made
             a run of map19 in 0:52, on the torch-trick route, and uploaded
             it as pa19-052. Steffen Udluft pointed out it wasn't in fact
             pacifist, as I had shot a cacodemon (doh). Adam Hegyi agreed
             and jokingly mailed back that I should try again "Or try taking
             the trick jump route, hehe". I mailed back saying "heh, there's
             a laugh", and made a proper pa19-052. however, adam had aroused
             my curiosity...and i had a go at the trick jump. well, it's
             actually a fairly easy jump with nomonsters on, but don't be
             deceived by this. With the arachnotron around, it is an absolute
             BITCH...plus because of the quality of Esko's lv19-041, the jump
             has to be done QUICKLY and the rest of the level has to fast.
             However, within just two hours I had pa19-041. Encouraged by
             this I set out on my odyssey to get a 0:40. ha, big mistake :).
             I played until 3am that night, making the jump a total of 8
             times. I got three 0:41s including pa19-041, one 0:43, was killed
             twice by the caco after the jump, and twice made it to the ledge
             and fell off without getting the key. I finally admitted defeat
             and went to bed. I got up bright and early today and played
             again. BANG, brick wall! For 7 hours straight I didn't make the
             jump once. Then, all of a sudden, I made it two times in
             succession! both attempts resulted in 0:41s, however :(((, due
             to careless running elsewhere. The first of these, pa19-41b.lmp,
             is a high 0:41, with sloppy running and slow ending. The second,
             lv19-41b.lmp, is a low 0:41 (0:41.20) which would have been 0:40
             had I not hesitated slightly opening the last bar :(((. Then I
             had to go to work. I retured a mere 5 hours ago, and sat down
             again...and this run is the first since then to hit the platform,
             and despite me being nervous as hell when I made it (I didn't
             even realise what was going on until halfway across the courtyard,
             I was idly wondering about whether I should go to bed while my
             brain controlled the player on autopilot :>), and running into
             some walls on the way to the exit, I was helped by a fast exit
             and FINALLY made it!!! the time is 0:40.85. I have now made this
             jump 11 times, and i'm well and truly sick of this level :)).
             0:39 is certainly possible, and probably even 0:38 by a human,
             but I really, really doubt anyone will try :). The demos included
             in this pack are:

             lv19-040.lmp, the record :)
             lv19-041.lmp, Esko Koskimaa's old record, the first run ever to
             manage this trick in a scratch run with monsters. You MUST watch
             this demo, if only because it was the first, and Esko's running
             is far smoother than mine :)
             pa19-041.lmp, my pacifist record
             pa19-41b.lmp, described above
             lv19-41b.lmp, described above

             Credits for this demo: the amazing trick jump was invented by
             Ilya Britvich, and first employed in a legal run by Esko Koskimaa.
             The route through the rest of the level is copied from Esko's
             lv19-041.lmp. Okay, i think that's far too much now, so i'll stop
             :).
