  Description :)

  After watching Demonlord's LMP (1:22), I decided to run his route but
  without taking the rocket lancher and the chaingun...

  And, here is the result... 59 secs, one month ago I did it in 2:14 so
  now I am more than 2 times faster...

  You need *some* luck, at the yellow, and at the red key...
