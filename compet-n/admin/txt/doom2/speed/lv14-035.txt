  Description :-)

  This magnificient brand new route was created by Anders Johnsen.
  Some weeks ago he mailed me and explained the trick... but I was
  quite sure that this cannot be done in normal play. I was wrong...
  I practiced this today and finally realized how I can preserve
  enough health for the route. My aim was to beat the D2dQ time
  of 0:36. It was a hard fight and I'm satisfied with the result.
  Yet, I feel 0:31-0:32 would look much better.
  I included a 0:39 with the old route, which also beats Panter's
  record so no one can say it's only the route which makes me fast :)

  Thanks again to Anders for the route and I hope you won't be
  angry that I stole it. There's still some time left and I guess
  it's only a matter of time when this gets beaten?
