Comments: Only 1 sec faster than Henning...but this is a damn hard map.
          Main difference is my slightly different tactics at the red key.
          This could theoretically go a lot faster...you _can_ get to the
          red key with one fewer shot, you can do the baron faster, you can
          run up the twisty path quicker...all in all, i'd say a good human
          time would be 0:42 and a good TAS time 0:38.
