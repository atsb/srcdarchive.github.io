Description: Hehe...nice run...took me 2-3 hours (Hi Adam)
             Two little mistakes (e.g. you can get the BFG faster than I do),
             but a perfect run in the end.

             Although the exact time is 34.88, I think 33 maybe 32 is possible,
             because I improved the old route a bit. (:

             Uhh, btw, what is the meaning of H in IMHO ?¨?

             This recording is not unbeatable (: ... So Adam, I think it is
             your turn again. 
             (After this I tried two more hours to get a 33, but I didn't
             succeed)
