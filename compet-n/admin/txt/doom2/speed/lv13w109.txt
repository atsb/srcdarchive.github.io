Description: Damn. I made this demo 37 whole minutes after Henning made his.
             Anyway, I just thought i'd submit it as a misc entry to
             demonstrate 1:09 done entirely without strafe50. Henning's demo
             has a very small amount of strafe50 in it (about 150 tics), not
             quite sure why. Congrats to Henning on his run, it was close tho,
             hehe :). This run is almost exactly the same time as henning,
             just one tic faster.
