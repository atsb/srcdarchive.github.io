Description: I have been running this map so much that I can't remember, maybe
             more than anyone else. So it became natural for me to give it a  
             try in the uv-speed cat. 

             I really tried hard to push it down to 0:54....but after 
             houers of playing I lost my concentration and gave up...
             I did this with the singel shotgun only...I don't know if taking
             the SSG will help you get a 0:54, my best attempt with the ssg is
             0:56. Anyway you will only get advantage of the ssg in the end. 
             Yes, I know it get's easier from that point but if you're lucky
             enough you don't get stuck on your way up from the red-key area.
             
             I'm actually very upset by my performance here, I got a headache
             after watching it. It isn't a demo that I could recommend 
             watching.
                   
             All in all I think it's too hard beating D2dq here, maybe 
             equalling could be done.
