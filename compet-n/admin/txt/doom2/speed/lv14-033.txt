Description: Wonderful jump that...(:
             I just had to try that at least...and surprisingly I got this
             jump very fast (pure luck I suppose).
             Improvement is done on the rest of the map...I lose 1sec at Archie

             1% Health/111% Armour (:

             31...maybe 30 seems perfect...but this is not my part
             (Anders vs Adam ?.....fight! :)

             btw: I added another jump I experienced a long time ago for pa14.
             (would have worked...but not in pacifist :)
