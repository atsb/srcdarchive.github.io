Description: Another little improvement. The Caco's block my way, but
             the spectre at the yellow key does not. Have tons of 1:07
             recorded. The trick near the imps is to stay some tenth of
             a second near the button and then fight your way back.
             If you have made it to the next switch, try to shoot, and
             hit, 3 imps before you open the other door.
