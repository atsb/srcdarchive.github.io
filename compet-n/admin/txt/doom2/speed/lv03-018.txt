Description:
Thanks dew for pointing out that 18 is possible. I gave this a try
every now and then, just to take a break for month or two because
of low 19. I thought this would be easy and I still think it is, but
I never gave a serious thought for the three pinkies in the ledge and
relied on luck instead. Well, of course, luck failed me. Just moments
ago I tried something else and it seemed to work reliable enough.
First 19.11 and then this.

I included a 19.00 demo showing 18 was possible without a rocket, too.
That was much better run anyway. If I just wouldn't have failed to
press exit button...
