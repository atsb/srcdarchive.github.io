  DooM II - Level 13 - Just FAST - II

  Ian Egle suggested I try this Map for my D2SG Free and it is
  up on the DHT system at 2:07 (D2SG-MGP.ZIP) so this is my go
  at it for COMPET-N.  I think it might be possible to go into
  the low to mid 1:40s with this route, but to go into the 1:30s
  will probably take a new idea or variation.

  My plan: Get the blur sphere, get the bezerk, get the blue key,
  get the plazma rifle, go invernerable & teleport to the top of
  the building to make the jump to the blue door, get the second
  invernerable, teleport to the red key, get the yellow key and
  exit.  The plazma rifle is not required but for some reason
  the revenants are never in the way if I grab it.  Same with
  the blur, leave it and I may (not always) get tangled up with
  a Caco on the jump.

  I spurn the rocket launcher because it takes longer to get, is
  more dangerous to use in close quarters and it requires ammo.
  On the plus side the rocket launcher has greater range and is
  more generally useful.  However, in this limited setting these
  advantages go mostly unused.

  Special thanks to Simon for the effort in maintaining COMPET-N.
  He may not always have the best LMPs, but he always has the best
  .TXT files by far and away.  Also thanks to Steffen, Anthe, Blake,
  Tom, Ian, Ashley, Matthew, Jeff, Jonathan, Nicholas, Jesper, Josh
  and all the other DHT toughs for their fine LMPs.
