Description: Hmmmmmmmmmmm.....some interesting things happend during my
             recordings. I found a new jump which saves about 3 secs. and
             I had a lv22-058.lmp with a nice bug in the end (I already had
             this bug in a map 5 attempt)...give me a mail if you want to have
             them.

             In this 53s. recording I forgot my Plasma gun, and I thought I
             wouldn't make it...but...who needs a Plasma in this map (:
             If someone can improve some more secs, and manages the jump a 48
             should be possible.
             
             This nice map took me about 1 hour...it is easier than I
             expected.
