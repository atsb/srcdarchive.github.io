	Sorry Jacih.... i found these jumps to be possible
        quite long ago... when i played with keyboard (Strafe50...:)
        And i couldn't do them as often with Strafe40 only...
        So i used Srafe50 for these two jumps...
  
        That's the same route as Panter but without waiting for the lifts.

        The bar trick can be a lot faster... but is too much based on luck

        P.S.: I did this cause i'm unable to do these bar trick... :((
              (ex.: map16 and map22)
