Description: Hmmmmmmmmm....I can't believe I did this in 5 mins...was my third
             try, I think.
             I just wanted to show this new jump to the yellow key, but it
             didn't work very well in this attempt...it took more seconds than
             the normal way, I think....but I'm still under DL's time.

             This should be possible under 2:30
