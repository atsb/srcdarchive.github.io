  Description :-)

  Changed my route after the first recordings - Thanx to Eric Mullins for
  inspiration. Maybe it's even possible not to get the Soul Sphere and go
  straight for the cellpack, made it twice, but lost too much time later,
  so maybe there'll soon be a much better time  (<1:00 ?? =8-)

  P.S. Don't take the shotgun right at the start (like I did), you'll get
       it later !!
