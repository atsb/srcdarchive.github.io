Description: Yeah.....I thought this would become as hard as map3...but it was
             a lot easier. This was the first time I reached 27secs. The exact
             time is 27.17, so it should be possible to beat my time...
             I think a perfect time (w/o Strafe50 & using my route)
             should be around 26.9...but maybe someone wants to proove me
             wrong (:

             Took me about 2 hours.
