  Description :-)

  Whew... this was hard...

  I had this little trick in my mind since 2 years now... but I never
  got the chance to get close to the record times... DL's (and Esko's)
  record seemed unreachable back then.
  I also changed the place to get my shotgun, I think it's faster this
  way.
  Now this is one of the most challenging speedruns IMO. There are 2
  jumps plus these 2 little tricks I mentioned. I feel happy that I
  could show all of them in one run.
