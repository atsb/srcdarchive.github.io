  Description :-)

  Hell, this was hard... Still far from perfect, but IMO it's impossible to
  get a perfect time on this map. There are still some route improvements left,
  (leaving the radsuit, doing the FJS jump) so under 2:00 is possible.
  Now only one map left to be done under half par... Anders, wanna go for it?
