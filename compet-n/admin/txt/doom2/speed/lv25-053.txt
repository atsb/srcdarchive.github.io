Description: Yeah, just cleared out another of DL's entries. This one was a lot
             easier than Map 20 or 21. I tried a different route (taking plasma
             but leaving the mega sphere) but it didn't work. So I took Demi's
             route again (-:. 30 mins later...hehe... my third
             entry. This time I copied my Doom into the Ramdrive, so it took
             only 1-2 secs to start again after pressing Q. 
             Improvement: only 1s. I just run a bit faster. 
             Hey Demonlord...how about strafing while running ? (<(-:
