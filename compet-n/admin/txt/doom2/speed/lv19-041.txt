Well, I've quit playing already, but because Anders asked for it, and
because nobody has uploaded a speed entry for lv19 using this jump
(discovered by Ilya Britvich), I decided to upload this lmp I did
weeks ago.

Panter, can you beat this? The exact time is 41.02 I think, so it
certainly is possible. Prepare yourself for a long session though -
making the jump with monsters around is the hardest thing for sure
I've ever done in this game...
