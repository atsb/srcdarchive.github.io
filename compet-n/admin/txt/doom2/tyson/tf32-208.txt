  Description :)

  Demonlord's tgm is pretty cool because he is able to take
  on the cyberdemon one-on-one, whereas in this demo I use
  Monster infighting and the invulnerability.  I got the idea
  of standing behind the cyberdemon from Cameron's tyson -fast
  TAS demo for e4m6.  If you haven't seen it, WATCH IT NOW.
  I did manage to get a few punches on the cyberdemon after the
  invulnerability wore off so it shows that I do have the
  skills to do it.  Maybe I could to e2m8 tyson grandmaster
  style and it would shut you up about not beating Demonlord's
  demo properly, but for now it's hard enough to get ~37
  punches without getting hit.  I think that it would be a
  good idea to make Tyson GM a regular cat for compet-n.
  Most of doom2 has been done and it's not trivial.
