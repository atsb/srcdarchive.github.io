Well as I said years ago, around 6min isn't hard even for a none tysoner like myself. 
I kept dying in the ssg secret, so maybe it's a better idea to clear that shithole
earlier on. Also by using the chaingunners more efficently in the end espessialy, 
should be more like it. 

So let's see how good we can make this one look adam ? ;)
