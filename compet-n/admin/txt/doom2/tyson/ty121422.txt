  Description :)

  Well I gotta say this is a pretty cool level, one of the
  few that I like from doom2.  I remember ranexeron saying
  something about Esko doing some 20 minute run, so it's
  nice to have a clear record.  Things went pretty well here,
  as you can see by the time.  I had an attempt ending at
  around 15:30 because I forgot to use -maxdemo.  There were
  only 3 cacos left anyways, but I don't think maxdemo was
  needed for this one.

  PS:  Sedlo, I'd love to see a speedrun on this map.
