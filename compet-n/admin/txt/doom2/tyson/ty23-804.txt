Description: This is my first COMPET-N demo. I watched the COMPT-N demo
             then thought, "I can beat that." So I did. So here you are.

             I take a slightly different route from Henning Skogsto's demo.
             The Arch-Viles are killed eariler. (Damn anoying things.) And
             the Revenants are used to help destory the Arachnotrons. (Ahh
             family feuds.)

             Well, enjoy the demo. If you don't may Tyson himself come and
             bite your ear off.
