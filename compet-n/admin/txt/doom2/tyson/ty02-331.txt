               Hmm...dunno about that...this took four tries :) Three of them
               ended right after redkey. I don't think it 
               should be described as a hard tyson map...leave that for map29
               and such :)

	       Hmm...this should be about a minute faster the old record :)

	       Sure. I agree...The bullets arn't that important though IMO.
               You can always try to knock a few guys if you are empty.

      	       Ehem....4:00 optimal? :) Wanna guess again :)?
