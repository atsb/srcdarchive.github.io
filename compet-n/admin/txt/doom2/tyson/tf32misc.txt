  Description :-)

  "I told you, I'll improve it. It didn't take too long huh? :)
  There's still that horrible finish though :/"

  That was my original description of the 1:21 demo
  on the 29th of January 2001.
  Now that more than a year has passed I think it's time to
  upload these demos. The one without the invul is exactly one
  year old today.
  Enjoy.
