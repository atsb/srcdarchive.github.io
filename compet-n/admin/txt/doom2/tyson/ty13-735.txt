Description :)

Guess you didn't expect this. This is my first demo since I recorded 30nm3413 so I thought I'd stop by and say hello :)
The demo itself shows that I'm slightly off my best I think, but it was fun to get back into it nevertheless. 

I hope this can motivate other seemingly retierd players to stop by once in a while and say hello, you all know who you are.
