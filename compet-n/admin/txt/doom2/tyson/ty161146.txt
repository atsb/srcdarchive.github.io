  Description :

  Fun tyson map. The first 2 tries I made it I got about 14 minutes. This is
  the third. The ending is kinda screwy, I should have kept those revenants
  alive. They're much easier to punch out than mancubi. It's hard to get
  close enough to the fat guys to hit them. Perhaps that's why George
  Foreman endured so long.
