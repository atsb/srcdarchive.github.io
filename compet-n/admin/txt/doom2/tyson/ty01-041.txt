  Description:

  After getting the max record I decided to give
  this a try.  Radek was right that 41 is possible
  here, but I'm sure 40 is possible too.  If anyone
  can get that it would be an awesome demo.  This
  demo is not perfect.  The beginning is ok, but
  near the end I get stuck going outside. Without
  that small mistake I don't think I could have
  gotten 40 anyways.
