Description: Hey my first Tyson entry (:

             I think I'll upload it although nobody seems to be interested in
             Tyson.lmps...
             How about adding this and some other categories to Compet-N ?¨?

             uhhh....btw...Adam ?...don't you want to get this map in Tyson
             too ? (-;

             It was fun...I even had a 3:08 but with 87% secrets only...hehe
