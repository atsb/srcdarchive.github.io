  Description :)

  Well, I thought I'd follow Sedlo's idea of improving a level
  until I get a time that I can be really proud of, so I tried
  this again.  I'm sure this will not be the last ty07 you will
  see from me, cause I got a bit freaked out at the end with 26%
  health left and no bullets, which resulted in the arachnotron
  part being barely faster than it was in ty071046.  The good
  part is my mancubus split time which is 2:12 in here, compared
  to 3:27 in ty071046.  Previous split times were 2:22 and 2:15.
