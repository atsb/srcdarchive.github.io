Hell, this is a hard level. Twelve seconds faster than the old record. The
speed for this depends on a few factors. How quick you are punching the imps
that come out of the traps in the red key area is the most important. The
other big factor is how many bullets you manage to save for the end - I had
14 going into the exit room, which is very unusual for my route, it's more
often 2 or 3. This is mainly affected by how many sergeants you have to
shoot...you should punch all the troopers you can, and all the imps you can
too. This could obviously go a lot faster, maybe 4:00 would be optimal, but
it's such a hard level you have to be careful. I've had two other runs where
I died punching the very last sergeant...one a 4:43, one a 4:50...that kinda
pissed me off :). I don't know how close this route is to the one Demonlord
used, I made it up myself without seeing his demo. This seems to be the safest
way of doing things quickly to me.
