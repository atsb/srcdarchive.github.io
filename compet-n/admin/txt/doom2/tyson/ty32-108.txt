Description :-)

  I really don't like Cyberdemons, huh?
  Another "it just happened" demo from me. Last night I was making a demo for
  Public DANG (again), and made 1:57.

  <Waldon> I'm gonna improve it I think.
  [15:16] <iamatslag> hmmz
  [15:16] <iamatslag> if u can
  [15:16] <iamatslag> do it
  [15:16] <iamatslag> :)
  <Waldon> It's not a problem.

  Well...I did it Marko. :)
