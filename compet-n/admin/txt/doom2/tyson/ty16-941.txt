Description: Back in 1999 Marijo Sedlic said under 10 minutes was possible,
             well it's finally here.

             The Imps at the exit are killed at the start with a bit of help
             from the Reveants. Same with that Mancubus in the backyard.

             This was the second time I managed to finish the level, the
             first had 99% kills and was 12:21. Enjoy!
