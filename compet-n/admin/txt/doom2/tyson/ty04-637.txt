Well, i'd say around 6 mins is pretty hard :). Once you try and punch the
imps quickly, you start dying a lot. 57 seconds faster than Henning's demo.
Credit to Henning for the route, I used all his tactics :). Just less
tentative all the way through. Would have been faster if the last spectre
had behaved itself.
