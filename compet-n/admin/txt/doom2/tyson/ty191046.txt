Description:  It's a very good map for Tyson, i think, only at the end is 
              it a bit boring (at least for me). Killing 30-40 Imps only
              by pistol isn't my favourite activity. Last record was over
              3 years old, so it needed improvement. A pity Cacos didn't
              kill Spider, i lost a few seconds there. Maybe i'll play more
              these long Tyson runs. 
              The route credits to Demonlord.
