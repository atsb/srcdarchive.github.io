  Description :)

  This level isn't terribly difficult.  After some time playing
  I got a 23:xx and a 21:xx, and the record was 19:xx.  This time
  I speed things up and use some better tactics, like getting lots
  of the slime pigs up on the rising lift so you can punch them out
  You can also punch them out on the stairs, but that's slower.
  As you can see this is far from optimal, for one thing I had
  bullets leftover, which could have been used on the hell knight.
