  Description :)

  Well I was fooling around on map07 and I noticed that I seemed
  to be having pretty good success on the arachs so I gave this
  a go.  The mancubus part this time was slightly slower this time,
  clocking at 2:15 instead of 2:12 in ty07-910, but I was able to
  do a bit of multiple punching on the arachs, and this time I
  didn't have any health and ammo problems at the end.  Again I
  don't expect this to be my last ty07 but hopefully you'll enjoy
  this one.
