  Description :)

  This was actually quite hard for me to do.  Keene's demo
  was pretty good quality, and he had good luck with the
  infights too.  Also it's easy to die on this level,
  especially on the way to the first megasphere.  Thanks
  to Adam Hegyi for checking that I killed all the monsters.
