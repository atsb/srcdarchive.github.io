  Description :)

  This demo is ok.  I didn't make too much of an effort,
  but I did get lucky that the pe's at the end didn't
  leave too many souls around so I could punch them out
  quickly.  I somehow managed to save way more bullets than
  I needed.  If you want to do this level I suggest you use
  more bullets because it's not a problem if you run out at
  the end.  All you need to do is punch the arch-vile a bit.
