Description:  Damn, what a nice map for Tyson! Don't you think ? Maybe some
              parts are a bit harder, but i like it anyway. Daniel's record
              was nearly 4 years old, and i improved it only by 10 secs.
              I wasn't as lucky as Daniel with monster fights. I had to
              kill the second Mancubus by pistol and it took me some seconds.
              I also lost a lot of seconds waiting for two Cacos. They were
              just flying above the acid and didn't want to kiss my Berserk. :)
              The route credits to Daniel "Demonlord" Lindgren. For more fun,
              go and watch his ty29 again!
