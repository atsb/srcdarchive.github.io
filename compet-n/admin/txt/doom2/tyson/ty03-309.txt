After beating Demonlord's old 3:16 with a 3:12, I decided to try and optimise
this map as far as possible, hopefully to under 3 mins. I think this route is
more or less the best possible, but there's still lots of stuff that can go
right or wrong in this run. I judge demos on this level on, mainly, how many
bullets I have at certain points: on the lift to the big area, just before
teleporting, and going up the last lift for the last time. On this run, I had
54 at the first "checkpoint" (best is 66), 145 at the second (my best by a
long way) and 60 at the third (my best by two or three). The most important
things are the amount of monster infighting you get in the big area and also
between the imps and demons/spectres at the end. There's still room for
improvement here, especially at the start. Note that I pick up a chaingun
without realising it as i'm running for the box of bullets and 25 health pack
in the right-hand pit...i've watched the demo four or five times though, and
i'm pretty sure I didn't fire anything with it.
