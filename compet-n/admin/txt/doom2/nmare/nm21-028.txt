  Description ;-)

  There is a way for getting the invul and not lose time at all.
  Just go for the imps' elevator first, then go for the invul
  and run back, catching the elevator just as it rises.
  It's terribly hard though, especially with the hell knights
  around... I could only do it with -nomonsters.
