              "You really need armor/supercharge when you jump down. I tried
              without them, it's not possible. You can proove me wrong."
              
              You are right...seems impossible w/o...should be very difficult
              with built!....but you lost 6sec on your way, and I couldn't
              resist to own this map in nm!, too. (:

              Had a lot of luck at the first elevator...7% and the Imp would
              have killed me one gametick after my shot...

              Took me about half an hour....
