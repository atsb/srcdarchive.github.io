Description:  Well, after I did it in UV speed wanted to do this in NM too.
              Needed 20 min. to beat your time Henning. I mean for 1.01 not
              for this one. I did it just few minutes before Zvonimir came
              to my place. Then I show him my latest recordings and after
              that I started to play this again. I don't know what was wrong,
              either that I didn't sleep at all last night or I just
              didn't have luck but for two hours I couldn't beat that 1.01.
              But when Zvonko sed that he must leave home and that I have
              only two more tryes it all started to improve. In that first try
              I fall of the ledges just before end, and this was my last try.
              Again like in ns05 I made it and again I had
              opurtunity to watch Zvonko's funny face when I did it ;))).
