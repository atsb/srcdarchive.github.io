Description: 
   Peo made me some pain with telling that he tried to do it without 
 the invulnerablity... hey that was hard, everyone tried to shot me down
 different easy places become damn hard... somebody always standed in my
 front... I think I had LOT of misluck too, it can't be that hard.
 huh... and only 2 seconds improvement (sigh)
