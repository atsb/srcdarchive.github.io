Description: I wanted to relax a bit (: 
             
             This is one of my favourite maps, you know...I couldn't resist
             to do this BEFORE someone gets an *easy* point by doing this.
             
             I took this shortcut for 3 reasons..
             1. I wanted 100% secrets
             2. IMO it's a bit easier....
             3. and it's faster of course (:

             30s improvement...hmmm just 1sec away from 1/2 Par time..

             Btw: this was my 6th attempt....
