Description:

	It´s funny, when you replay this nm-lmp, you think:

		"Hey, it´s so easy." 
	

	When you try to record the lmp, you think:

		"surf-waves of mancubus-shots and lots of respawned
		 spiders". 


	I like this level, simple and good.

	And now i have the record: 65sec. It´s surely possible to
	beat this time, but you should have patience. You need
	luck, so that the spiders don´t respawn. And spiders love
	it to respawn (tssssssshhhhh).
