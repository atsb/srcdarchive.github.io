Description: This .lmp had several reasons...(no...I don't want to talk about
             them NOW :)
             But at least I showed that I can do that jump (:

             Btw: I haven't figured that out....but maybe it's possible to
             do one of my trick.lmps w/o turbo...
             Maybe some expert Builders or Strafe50er's can show this to me in
             a non Compet-N .lmp....I'd really like to see if it's possible..
