Description: 

  I actually did this a few months ago but wanted to improve the time
  before sending it in.  But I wound up getting distracted by other
  things, so........

  Main difference from my previous record is that I bypassed the blue
  armor and took the green armor instead.  I think 3:10 is possible with
  this route...how else to improve it?  Maybe I'll skip the invulnerability
  next time. :-)))
