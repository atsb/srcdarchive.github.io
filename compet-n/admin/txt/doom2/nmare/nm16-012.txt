  Description : Like I sed in one of mine txt's, Nightmare is just like
                ultraviolence only you need more luck. This time I didn't 
                need 5 hours to make this. Just 1.5 hour. And that glide isn't
                the bigest problem. Problem is how to survive to make it.
                Then I found the way, after that it wasn't hard to do it.
                I really couldn't let this one in other hands.
                Sorry guy's but this map is my favourite ;))).
                Enybody want to beat my ns on this one???
                Go for it ;))).
