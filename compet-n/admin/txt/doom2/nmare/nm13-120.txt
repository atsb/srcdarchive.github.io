  Description :-)

  Oh yes, how sweet is to beat Demonlord!
  And cutting off eleven whole seconds off his record... Well, IMHO he didn't
  optimize that time very much...
  IMHO with this route (and with luck) 1:16 is optimal. If you can somehow
  skip the first invul (Ilya?), then 1:13.
  This is one of my few records when I had fun trying it ;)))))))
