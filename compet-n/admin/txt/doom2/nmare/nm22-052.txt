Description: And again I wanted to relax a bit (:

             Wow....I beat my own UV-record, but IMO it's easier to get a good
             time on NM here rather than on UV...(because of the 140 cells
             difference). And take a look on the health !

             How about 48 as a perfect time here ?...someone wants to prove me
             wrong (: ?

             Although I really like this "second most difficult NM-map", I'll
             stop this here...Gimme a mail if you disagree.
