  Description :-)

  Yeah, this is my first COMPET-N entry!
  This is the same route as Demonlord did, just a bit faster. It took 30 min
  to record. I think 0:15 is possible (probably with strafe50) or if you can
  run past beside Him, the time can be further improved to 0:13. But I agree
  with Demonlord: that seems quite impossible.
  Hey Demonlord, why do you need 14 rockets to kill 4 Keens?
