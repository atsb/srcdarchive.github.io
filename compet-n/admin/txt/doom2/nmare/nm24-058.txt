Description: Well this was much harder than I expected Sedlo. No wonder you 
             had to sit houers to beat your 1:01. It's a pitty you had to 
             leave compet-n. We could have had some interesting figths in
             the future. Cause now I gotta eat all your points.....and you 
             can't do anything about it :))
