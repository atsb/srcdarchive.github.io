 Description: 
   It's the result of our home competition between Laci and me, I was done it
 weeks ago, but waiting for Laci's turn. Yesterday he sad, 42 sec is good
 enough for him, so I thought I should upload it.
   I doesn't think that this will be the best time ... but it's a nice try. :)
   When Laci reached 52 I thought it's impossible under half par, but 
 Demonlord showed that I was wrong again.
   So watch it,and do it without the megaarmor, I'm sure you will be under 40, 
 but good luck for you!
