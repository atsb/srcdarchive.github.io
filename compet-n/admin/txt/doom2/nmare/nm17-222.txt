And I'm writing once again :) Hey Vincent, nice run you had. You really have
become a great all around player these days. Hmmmm think I'm the one who 
should say " Plz Vince stop beating me here :) " 
Anyway...we're getting closer to breaking the 02:20 barrier. I think when you
said that 02:15 should be close to flawless, you were right :) 
Oh well, I hope I don't get beaten by another 3/4 seconds :-)

btw, Whatch the strange.lmp too....for no reason that archie suddenltly 
     decided not to kill that chaingunner. I can't come up with an explanation
     why he didn't finish him off eigther.
