  Description : beats the record by 20 seconds... thanks
		entirely to Rimmer's bar_slide.
		I want to see a real player take this run.
		I think Sedlo could drop it to :25 or so.
		I think nm is impossible without the 666.

		I have stayed 'up' after the slide, but
		just once.  I think that would drive the uv
		speed down to :20.

		First Doom2 COMPET-N demo of the new Millenium!
