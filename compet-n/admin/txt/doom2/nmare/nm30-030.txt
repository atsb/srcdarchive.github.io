  Description :-)

  Hehe... if you know me enough you'll understand why I *had* to do
  this one too...

  Sorry again Demonlord... but this level isn't yours "now and forever" :)
  You shouldn't have left any gaps...

  I'll leave re30-030 and fa30-030 to anyone who wants to try this.
  As you see they aren't any different from this particular run but
  I don't have the patience to do this again. My aim was to get the
  UV and NM records and those are now mine.
