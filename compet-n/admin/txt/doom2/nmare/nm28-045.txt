Description: Finaly got this run, must have been recording for 3 houers now. 
             I'm very happy to get a 0:45 run here becorse I had some nearly
             perfect runs ending at 0:47 and 0:48. You will see lot's of slow
             spots here and Adam's uv record should IMO be reachable even in 
             NM mode. Maybe the archie's will help you save even more time :)
