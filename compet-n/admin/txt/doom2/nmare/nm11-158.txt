  Description:

  Another Out-Of-Base for all the hungry D2I-Guys. This map is
  probably harder than map 04. The start is a bitch but if you
  get to the plasma gun everything is OKay. Only Mr. Archville
  meant to say something, when he hit me without seeing me for
  a rather long time - Wonder how the engine copes with this ?

[ This recording was also thought for as a "D2S-Free" so there
  is also a D2S-AAK dance near the end... Sorry Mr. Admin. :-) ]
