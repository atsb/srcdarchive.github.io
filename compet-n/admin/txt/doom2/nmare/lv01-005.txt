  LV01-005.LMP - NightMare!  ( Why Not ;-)

  Recorded using Doom2 Version 1.666
  Plus a Level1 (Doom2 Ver.1.9) .WAD
  And Converted to Doom2 Version 1.9
  Thus:
  Doom2 -PlayDemo with Version 1.9 - Only

  DooM II - Level 01 - "EntryWay"

  Kills      7%
  (Items     0)
  Secrets    0%  and Time  00:05  (exact time - 05:97)
                           -----

  What's special:

         For all these guys, who like running to the exit.
         This is the ultimate challenge for them.
         Almost all the time at strafe left/right 50,
         except for the turns, and then only 40 ;-).
         And the first tics are free, because every .LMP
         starts a little bit later.

  See (better with -TimeDemo) how I ran.
