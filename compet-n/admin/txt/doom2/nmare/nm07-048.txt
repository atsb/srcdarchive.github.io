  Description :-)
  
  This is the strangest record I ever got.

  I was chatting with ocelot about this level on IRC,
  and I thought, why not give it a few tries, just for fun.
  
  I got a 56 in a few tries while we were talking, then
  I played on and got this. 22nd try... I guess luck
  was on my side.
  
  You'll notice how bad this run is, I wasn't even half
  warmed up: the mancubi, I fire a rocket in the air for
  no reason, two of them didn't die as planned, the spiders,
  another rocket wasted, and the exit already up at least
  1 second before I get there.
  
  I killed 9 spiders while 2 mancubi fought the other 3,
  they did a pretty good job (better than me, at least).
  
  This could go much better than this, ultimately, the bigger
  supply of rockets should push this under the UV time.
