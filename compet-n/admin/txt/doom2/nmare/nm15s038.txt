  Description :-)


        Sorry Adam ... I was trying this one for about 15 min and got this lucky run. :)
        I took the BFG w/o opening the baron's room. Maybe it's a loss of time... but
        i didn't want to waste this precious run :) with getting stuck by the PEs.

	ahem...i recorded this one under Winblows 98.... the mouse config was really bad, 
        with vertical sens. and very low overall sens.
