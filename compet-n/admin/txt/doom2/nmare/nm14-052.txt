             Okay, I tried what Adam H suggested and didn't have much luck. 
             I only tried the arhie jump invented by Anders once...it is 
             very easy. But every time I had decent health I skipped the 
             invisibility. But I think if the archie trick actually
             works you will have quit good chances of survival towards the end, assuming you
             got the invisibility ofcourse. 

             So the next challanger should do something like that
             I think.
