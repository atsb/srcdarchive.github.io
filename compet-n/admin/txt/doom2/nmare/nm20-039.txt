Description: Last summer I discovered some ideas to do this, but
forgot them. Now lately starting to do speedrunning in doomworld
I remembered those ideas and started to practise a little bit. 
Actually this is my first and only exit :), though I had a one,
would be 40 run, but died just a few milliseconds away of exit.
Trick is done by just moving forward a little bit, turning left, 
smashing srafe50 keys down and hoping it works... Exciting, eh?
