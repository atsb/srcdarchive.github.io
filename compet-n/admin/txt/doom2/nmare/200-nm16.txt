  Description :-)

  "MAP16-NM untouched" is not too hard as soon as the right
  strategy is developed. But pure luck is required to cross
  the green slime (before getting the blue key) without any
  damage.

  I claim 200% because S.;-) has authorized that the
  minimum health counts not from the beginning but
  *from the moment you first get hurt*.

[  Admin. Note :-)  Yep, " Maximum Minimum Health =  200 % "

   Although the methods of "scoring" M.M.H may well change
   from level to level ( depending on each of the maps ;-)

   200% & NO Damage is a WIN - on any method - Well Done !
