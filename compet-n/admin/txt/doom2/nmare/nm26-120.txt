Description: Well, Adam said he found a nm26-120 from me at FJS's page.
             So I tried to find it in of my many Doom-Dirs (I never delete any
             .lmps)
             Finally I got it...I also got a nm26-119.lmp (Don't even knew
             that I can do this map in NM)...but in this .lmp I die one time..
             I upload it anyway, because it's interesting to see how easy it
             is to die in this map...

             If you want to beat my time...PLZ..don't do it in 1:19 (:


             97'or 98'...can't remember
