  Description:

  This is just an answer to Kai Uwe who thought that I can't do
  this. Well I recorded it one day after he sent me his version
  and I was very pleased with mine, since the beginning is very
  easy and always the same, which makes recording a lot easier.
  In the end maybe I tried a bit to much with playing it safety
  (kill everyone that crosses my path). Of course, 100% secrets
  could be done here also.
