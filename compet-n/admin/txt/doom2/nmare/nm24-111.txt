Description: Another 20min. work (ok I was VERY lucky in the end :)
             I wasted one BFG-shot in the Demonroom...consequently it should be
             possible to skip that (about) 7sec.-sequence in front of the
             soulsroom (you know...the one where I took that backpack to get
             one more BFG-shot)
