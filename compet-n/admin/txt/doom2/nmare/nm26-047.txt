Oh my god....this was H-A-R-D. I didn't use any strafe50 at all. And I think
it's kinda wierd that some players do use it to beat records that were set with
regular strafe40 (hint hint). If you try to do that yellowkey strafe without
strafe50 on nmomonsters you will succssed 1/10 if you are lucky. That was the
case for me at least. The reason why I didn't implent it last time was because
there are a (nm)fast mancubie guarding the key + you got a million skulls/cacos
etc fireing from behind. In addiction to all this you will also have to
concentrate a 100% to get in the right position to perform that strafe which is 
almost impossible. In most cases you will also get stuck and killed on 
your way back from yellowkey, cause there will be several (nm) fast cacos 
shotting and blocking your way.  

This is without any deubt the hardest nm recording that I have ever done. 
Only 30nm was harder.

PS, If you will try to beat this Vincent I hope you will do it my way. Cause I
    put alot of time and effort in doing it this way. I would have needed 
    only an houer or so if I used strafe50 to perform it with.
