  Description:

   This was quite a hard one. I felt a little step forward after
 every  try, so I kept on trying. Peo said that I should conserve 
 some rocket  launcher ammo for the returning, I didn't knew how 
 many I'll need, maybe I conserved too many of them... I had a 
 surprise after I opened the door (in returning phase) my right 
 button stucked.... I almost fired a rocket in the wall... 
 huh that was so close... my heart almost stopped.
