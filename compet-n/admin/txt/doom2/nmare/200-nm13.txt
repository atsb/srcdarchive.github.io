  Doom2 - Level 13 - "Downtown"

  Maximum Minimum Health =  200 %

  Description:

  A "real life" level - not as trivial as, like, MAP08, yet
  completed with 200% health and untouched. Fine timed
  usage of I.V. spheres makes it possible. Still you never
  know how the things will go in the yellow key room.

  I claim 200% because S.;-) has authorized that the
  minimum health counts not from the beginning but
  *from the moment you first get hurt*.

[  Admin. Note :-)  Yep, " Maximum Minimum Health =  200 % "

   Although the methods of "scoring" M.M.H may well change
   from level to level ( depending on each of the maps ;-)

   200% & NO Damage is a WIN - on any method - Well Done !
