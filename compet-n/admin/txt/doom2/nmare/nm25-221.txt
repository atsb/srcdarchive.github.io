Description: Simon refused this level for his D2I challenge, ...
                   ^^^^^^^
[ Hold on right there ! I already explained in my D2I-SYW.TXT that I had
  to make it QUICK (rather than GREAT ;-) because I knew I had to get it
  uploaded FAST - before all SIX (!) (of my) possible Out-of-Base levels
  would be gone, forever... That's why I "refused" it. I might have made
  another for this Compet-N, but there's not much point if you are going
  to make my efforts look pathetic even before I try - You may continue: ]

             ... but it is not that hard. The tricks:
             1) The first shot to wake up the sergeants.
             2) The barrel
             3) Take the left side when you run through the room.
                Pass the revenant close.
             4) Do what you want in the dark, I hate the candle-things and
                wanna finish it fast there. But you can also take out the
                monsters one by one.
             5) Take a breather after teleporting.
                Clean the sweat from your mouse.
             6) Hurry so as not to be blocked. Take care of the barrel.
             7) If you wanna have a title, do your dance at the cells.
             8) Run straight after teleporting, or kill them. Depends on
                how much %%% kills you wanna have.
             9) You have enough health -> don't panic.
            10) Behind the blue doors NO mancubus, they're only in netganes
                Disadvantage: No BFG/Cells, but who needs them.
            11) Take the left Pain Elemental.
            12) Press the button and Exit.

            With these hints you should be able to complete this level in
            less than 10 tries. I had 15, but I had to find the way. It's
            like climbing in the mountains. The first one is without that
            much safety, the others have got a rope. As you can see, less
            than PAR is possible. Besides: Which level is not ? NM04 ?

[  Admin. Note ;-)  See above !!!

   D1I-GIB.TXT backs up my own views on DHT "race conditions" to get our
   advanced titles completed and uploaded as soon as we possibly could -
   before our chosen Out-of-Base levels are gone. While it's true that I
   can be proud to get the title, I am *not* particularly proud of those
   .LMP's because I could do a *lot* better - given the time to do so...

   S.;-)  D1I and D2I  no more, no less.
