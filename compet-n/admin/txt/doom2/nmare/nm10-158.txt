Description: I recorded this remarkable .LMP while "training" for D2I.

             The remarkable part is that I take no damage at all for
             the entire first half, all the way to the sergeant's room.
             Then I get hammered, but with more care and extreme luck
             it is probably possible to do this whole level untouched.
