Description: I thought about what to do in this map in a nmrun when I enter
             with <30% health...it's impossible to survive the chaingunners
             then and I wanted to know if I can get that beserk first...
             While trying I got some nice ideas how to improve my last nm23...

             First improvement is to leave that left demon-wall open and to
             use this way...If you aren't too fast here there are no demons
             you have to shot.
             Then I got the yellow key through the spiders (w/o walking around
             them)
             Finally I tried to get past the last demons w/o killing them...
             Well..it didn't work (:

             Anyway...0:55 should be possible using this route.

             btw: what happened at the 2nd teleporter ?...normally you've to
             wait some time after teleporting...hehe...not .me (:
