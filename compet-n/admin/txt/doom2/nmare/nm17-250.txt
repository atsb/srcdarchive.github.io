and again...it's me (:

Anthe did a 3:12 but didn't upload it...and Istvan "ordered" a better one..
here it is...

I changed the route and didn't take the invisibility...Well, the main problem
was to survive that Revenant behind the yellow bars...w/o that sphere EVERY
imp hit its target.
I was right....below 3:00 is possible (:
This .lmp looks very close to perfect now...ok...that misguided rocket and the
fast respawning spider doesn't make this very convincing. But health is suberp
throughout the whole .lmp (until the end :)
IMO 2:40 is the maximum.

...last orders plz (:
