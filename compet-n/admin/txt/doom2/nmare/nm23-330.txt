  Description:

  This is a *very* hard level and I needed rather long to
  make it. The hardest part is of course the one with the
  pinkies (biting bitches). With only a chaingun you must
  have a bit of luck to get through and sometimes when I
  got through something else happened later. That's why I
  played the rest very carefully, even Mr. Archville had a
  short respawning time. This is also an Out-of-Base for
  the coming D2I, and it's a real challenge for everyone
  (except some Germans, I guess).
