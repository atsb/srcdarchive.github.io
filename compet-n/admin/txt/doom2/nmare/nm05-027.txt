	Sorry Henning, i was desperating to beat you nm17-222... so i retried this
        map... 
        After 15 min. i got this lump ... incredibly lucky with the lift and the imps.
        An imp got a bullet from one of the gunners of the start... he was a very usefull
        shield against the shots of the other imp :=)) that's the first i see this.
        So i had a lot of health after the lost souls (122%).

        I guess 0:25 is possible...
