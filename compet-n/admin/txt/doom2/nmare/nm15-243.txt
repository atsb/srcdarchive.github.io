Description: Basically Jason's route. I think by skiping the green armor you 
             can save quit some time maybe 15 or 20 sec and time could 
             get interesting. And maybe someone wanna improve this one becorse
             this demo is just crap. I hope the next challanger skip the armor
             and run more forward. I havn't tried the last room without the 
             invul, maybe taking the invul at first is better. But I suppose 
	     the RL will come in handy when doing so.
