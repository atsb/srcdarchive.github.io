Description: (-:
             I knew I can make it...and it is not as difficult as I thought.
             There is a 30% chance (for me) to do it to the red key...
             But the hardest part is after the elevator...I had a savegame
             with 100% health just before this...and I did it every 20th
             attempt..
             And finally...Dadaaaa!...the 2nd map22nm .recording. (exactly 40s
             faster than Anthe)
