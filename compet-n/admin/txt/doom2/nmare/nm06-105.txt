  Description :-)

  I thought of doing this map some time ago, but I never tried if because
  I thought Ilya's 1:15 was already improved by Panter. Well I was quite
  surprised that the 1:15 was still the best, so I decided to give it a go.
  I got 1:12 with Ilya's route fairly easy. Then I tried doing the UV route,
  taking the 1st mega on my way back, not taking plasma and the 2nd mega.
  This proved out to be too hard, the imps on your way back from the red key
  room are too tough on NM with SG. (Prove me wrong, anyone...)
  Then I tried this plasma version and taking the 1st mega right at the start,
  and leaving the 2nd mega. I got 1:07 with this. Then I realized that I don't
  have to kill the sargeant at the elevator... another 2 secs seemed possible.
  Here it is... after 220 tries. (Half of those missing the 1st jump, heh)
  I'm fairly satisfied but of course this still can be improved furthermore...
  I'd say one could end up with 1:01-1:02 on Nightmare...
