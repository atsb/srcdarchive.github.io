Description: Wow...Istvan's 1:01 is REALLY good....ok, I was a bit slow at the
             mancubus but I hardly did it that far...(and Istvan had A LOT of
             luck there :)

             Once I had a recording in which I reached the RL-Room with 97%,
             but even this doesn't help at the imps...
             Anyone wants to beat this ? So...just try it for 300 times and
             you'll make it...(it's a 1:00,1 btw :-)
