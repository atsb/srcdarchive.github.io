   ...and Time    01:14
                 -------


Description: Hmmm this was strange, I had times ranging 01:17 to 1:20 all the
             time and thought 01:16 was just about reachable. I did try Adam's 
	     skiping the 1st invul solution for a while but it was to hard. 
             I think 01:13 would be very hard to reach using this route.
	     If someone will beat this one I suggest they try to stay alive 
             until they get the second invul. I was very lucky in this one when
             grabbing the red-key. I got this lift off u know :)
             By skiping the first invul you can save aprox 3-4 sec and if 
             you're lucky enough you might get near Daniel's uv-speed record 
             here. Since it's recorded with starfe 50, this would be a big 
             challange. It may be possible to beat him since 01:13 is 
             rechable using my route.
