Forgive me folks, I am quite happy after all this stress over the last
months...

yipi i yeeeee yipi i yooooo ....

seriously: still I see some seconds (yes we're right there where we ended 
up with the uv skill ...), I also tried to play it like I do on uv w/o any
preparation before the spectres (hell knight) and the imps, but you survive
only 1/10 the spectres scene and I would say 1/100 the imp scene above. In
the number of tries (appr. 250) with this tactic I survived only once but
was then killed by a waiting sergeant since I only had health <10%.
