Description: Well this wasn't easy. This map is Hell on Nightmare, espesially
             when useing the ssg only. I got 01:05 sevral times but I missed
             that last jump :((. I played this map a while useing the plasma 
             version and that makes things a lot easier, then I thought of 
             doing it without the plasma gun becorse I wanted to prove Adam 
             wrong, and to see how this would effect the time. This was the
             closest I got to 1 min, below 1 min is to hard I guess (prove me
             wrong, Adam). I only reached the last room 1 out of 20 times when  
             I got past those Imps on my way back from red-key.
