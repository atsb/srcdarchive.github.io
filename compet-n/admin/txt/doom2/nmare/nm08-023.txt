Description: After producing a 23sec map08 .lmp for FJS's -fast Collection
             I thought it should be possible to have the same time on NM.
             Took me about three hours (w/o Sound) and I had a lot of 25's and
             24's.
             It is much more difficult to do this for normal uv-speed records,
             because the Barons walk around instead of shooting at you.

             Hey, DL...try to beat *THIS*. (-;
