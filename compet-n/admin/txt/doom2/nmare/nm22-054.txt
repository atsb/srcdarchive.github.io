Description: Hmmmm...another 8sec. ripped off...(but it's getting harder now,
             because this one took 45min. (and I died about 3 times in the last
             room (that never happened before :)))

             So....that last part took only 28% !! health (not counting the two
             medi packs, which you take anyway)...luck ? ok, a bit...only one
             Chaingunner in my back, but I saved a lot of plasma at "our friend
             the Baron"
             Btw: It's a 54:00 (quick note for all this sadistic players out
             there :)

             IMO 50sec. would be perfect here...do you want to see more
             nm22-action ? Gimme a mail (:
