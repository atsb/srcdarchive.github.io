	     I saw the speed and pacifist demo and tried it myself and I did get 0:19.
	     Then I thought about Nm and tried that also.
             It is gettin' better every time. :)))
	     I guess someone will improve this soon.....You Sedlo or does Panter want his
             record back????   :))

	     I thank Jonathan Rimmer for the trick!!!!!
