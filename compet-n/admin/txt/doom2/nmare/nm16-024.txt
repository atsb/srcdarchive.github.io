Wrong both times! :). Trick isn't done quite as quick, but the rest of the
demo is perfect...got the invuln perfectly and did the quick jump at the
end (invented by Marijo I believe). It probably is possible to do this with
SSG and megasphere, but rather harder...of course, the trick in this demo is,
once again, invented by John Rimmer, thanks.
