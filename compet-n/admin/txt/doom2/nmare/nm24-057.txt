  Description :)

  Well, it may seem a little lame for me to be uploading this
  one second improvement, but I consider 57 a nice time for me.
  I use a new route which skips one cell, but that means only
  2 bfg shots in the pig room.  Sorry I got nervous, so maybe
  it could have been 56 without the ending screwup.
