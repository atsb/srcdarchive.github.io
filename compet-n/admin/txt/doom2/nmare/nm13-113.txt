  Description :-)

  I just can't describe the adrenaline rush as I saw there are no
  monsters in my way after I exited the yellow key room...
  I had to catch my breath for a minute after I saw the intermission.

  So, only 1 second improvement but hey it is F-A-S-T-E-R! :)
  This map gets harder and harder as the record gets better...
