Yeah, just crazy, I got some low 34 so I believe that even 32 is
possible, you just dont have to get the keygrab the way I did :(
Then you will need a little bit more luck to get fast thru the
yellowkey area. btw. the zombie keepin here a yellowkey did a very
nice job for me there, also the pig in the exitroom did. Enjoy !
I will try few more maps too ! :)).
