Description:	Nmare the fast way. You really need armor/supercharge when you
		jump down. I tried without them, it's not possible. You can
		proove me wrong. I haven't taken the bullet boxes here. They
		might be useful :) The Spiderwas not perfectly placed, but
		I pushed her away with the last 30 bullets.
