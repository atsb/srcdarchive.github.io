Description: Noticed I had done 26 like half a year ago, but since it wasn't doom2.exe 
I gave it a try. I have never investigated faster way to do that glide (Rimmer style? Is
this Catalaà style? hmm...) so that imp were quite a pain in the ass. It probably has to 
be quite perfect run to get 24 since I got only 24.97 nomo with this route, but anyway, 
I'm happy with 25 since I almost uploaded 26 before coming to my senses. Actually 
I just noticed Hegyi mentioned this maneuvre (nm21-028.zip), but I didn't find that too 
hard considering that glide and possible screw ups in red key area and the final bars.
