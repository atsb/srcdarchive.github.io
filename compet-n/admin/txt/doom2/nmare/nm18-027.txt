  Description:

  After trying routes with invulnerability and also one with a blue sphere
  and only getting 33 seconds I wondered if there was any difference between
  UV and NightMare... not much... stay healthy and you'll be fine :)

  The annoying bits are always the stupid Imps getting in the doorway near
  the end of the lmp.
