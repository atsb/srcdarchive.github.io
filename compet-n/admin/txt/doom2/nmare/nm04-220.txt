Description: <old description snipped>
             Just some seconds faster. Just missed the lift. Not that easy
             to stay there if the imp has seen you and change to chaingun
             meanwhile. This is surely not the safest way, and not the
             fastest either, but a good compromise.
             Level 4 is now not that hard anymore. I have reached the exit
             2 times within 20 tries.
             Dunno why there is only 0% secret.
