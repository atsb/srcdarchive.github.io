Description: Well, what can I say...maybe only: YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
I beat one minute's limit and it's greate! I don't know why I couldn't found
this trick when working with this level for the first time. Maybe since
that time green player lose so much flesh ;). And I didn't know about 
that possibility to run through the crusher without strafe50. 
Lost souls were excellent in door-keeper role ;)
