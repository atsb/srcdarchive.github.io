  Introduction...

  This is an Example for a New Category of NightMare! .LMP's...

  "Maximum Minimum Health" - Complete each DooM and/or DooM II
                             Level "safely" ie. as Far From 0%
                             Health (Death) as possible ! :-)

  Description :-)

  Now this one is much more like it - I never slip below 78% :-)

  The start was not too bad (88%) and I charge up into the first
  room and kill the chaingunner unsighted, replennish my health,
  take some armour and go on to max. out at 200-101 and keep it,
  at least for a short while ;-) I make a much better job of the
  skulls (91%) but I set off the chaingunners too soon (81%) and
  THEN a skull gets me (78%) - Megasphere Time :-) Next I take a
  real hammering on the following teleporter/elevator, though it
  hardly matters... 78% was a pretty high "low point" ( ? ;-)
