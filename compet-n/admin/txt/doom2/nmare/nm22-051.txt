Description: Did this one after 10min. (:

             Watch out for the new beginning...w/o shooting that Spectre...
             ...and look at THAT health..nobody wanted to stop me up to the
             Baron.
             This run is nearly perfect...IMO it is perfect with 2 little
             mistakes.
             1. I tried to get a MediPack with 132% health...2 seconds.
             2. I played that last part too slow...another 2 secs.

             So 47 should be optimal when using my route......BUT (: ...hehe
             IMO this won't be the final route...There's a jump which saves
             3-4 secs. (and a lot of Health) and it's possible to do some
             situations a bit faster...
             So...all in all...40s. is the ultimative goal here. (maybe I'm a
             bit exaggerating...but I'm tired of this "one more sec. is
             possible"-talking after each new .lmp)
