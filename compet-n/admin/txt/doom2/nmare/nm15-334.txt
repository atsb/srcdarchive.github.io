Description: 

  Wow, my first Compet-N entry. :-)  A while ago I recorded this map in
  6:08 but never submitted it, even though I knew of no one else who
  had completed map15 via the "regular" exit.  But then when I saw Istvan's
  4:08 lmp, I figured there was room for improvement...

  I took several clues from Istvan's recording (had no idea you could reach
  the plasmagun w/o going outside) but made a few changes; specifically,
  saving the invuln. until the end so I could make a beeline for the exit. :)

  Anyway, this is my first (and probably last) Compet-N entry, so forgive
  the length of this text since I gotta shoot all my marbles at once. :)
  At least, until Panter or somebody beats this time....
