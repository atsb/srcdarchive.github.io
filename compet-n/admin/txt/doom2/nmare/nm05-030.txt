Description: okay I'm a littel pissed of at this one...mainly because I managed 
             to overwrite a 0:30.lmp that I got 1 houer ago...:(( 
             
             Well fortantly for me I did it again within resonable time :=)
             You really can't do much more than run and hope for the best.
             But if you're having problems here in a nm movie, I can strongly 
             recommend that you do try to do it from scratch...
