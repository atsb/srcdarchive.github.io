  Description:

  Ya, and another Out-Of-Base D2I. This is the most exciting
  recording I have of this map, the end is pure luck.

  I have other (more safe) versions but this is the best for
  watching... action until the very end. A very hard map but
  surely not harder than 23. OKay again, I am very sorry for
  the dancing but it *was* ( ;-) also a candidate for a free
  for my coming D2S...
