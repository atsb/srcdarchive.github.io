Description:	Got this LMP on my attempt to improve the nm30-105 (I still
		had a nm30-046 in my Nightmare! collection, but that was not
		one with a perfect route. With one miss my best time was 0:44.
		I had another thought for an improved /built, maybe if there
		was first an Archvile to appear, you don't have to be on the
		column but can jump 3 times, and would that be faster?
