Description: I think this is one of my best lmps. Have I proved now, that
             I am a DooM-Hero ? [ Simon ? ] Or am I just the first who has
             reached the exit? I tried for 4 days to complete this level !

             I think 150 tries overall. Not bad, isn't it ? I know people,
             who have tried for a long time and still have not yet made it
             ( Anthe ? Is this a challenge ? Or do you try first to record
             all the other levels in NightMare ? Or to make your D2S. Now,
             where Steffen is out. <Sniff> )

             For the dht-exams: I rate this level Ultra. Nobody who is not
             insane should even consider to try it as an Out-of-Base level.
             I want to see if some of these "Super-Doom-Heros" with tons of
             titles (The only real ones are D?Schwarzenegger) can record a
             little .lmp like this one. So, I think the COMPET-N site has
             got the better .LMP's, even if Simon sometimes betrays it for
             some D2I. Hey, Simon, try to make a record in your site ! ;-)
             Don't know which one: Level 30 "maxkills" should be available.
             Even Level 04 should be improvable. Watch the 1:33 and you'll
             know that I lost around five seconds. And I would suggest you
             update the current.tab even if the lmps are still not on the
             site - Just to get to know the times - Or mail it personally.
             This, or you give me a NM04-??? ;-) !
