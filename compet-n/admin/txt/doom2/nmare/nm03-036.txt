Description: I played this level as a free.lmp for my Doom2 Incubus.
	I wanted to beat the 45sec of Andreas "Anthe" Kren from his
	old Doom2 Master free.lmp. (Anthe´s lmps have inspired me to
	seriously play Doom.) I made it with 40sec and I was happy.

	One day later I downloaded the record in the Compet-N from
	Yonatan "Paranoid Android" Donner with 37sec:
	    "...so here it is, 0:37, not too good but
		        	  who cares, it was very easy so..."
	Hahaha. This wasn´t very easy or my new record will be beaten
	in a few days. I will see it then.
	My record was hard and I had many tries. Almost every part of
	my lmp can be optimized, but a lmp must	be done in one piece.
	This is the hard thing.

	Hello to all Doom-players and bye bye!
