Description: While watching several .lmps I noticed a little mistake in NM15.
             In my latest download there was only Peo's nm15-046...and NO .lmp
             for the normal exit. (Although he did it too)

             So should I name this .lmp nm15-043 or nm15s043..? Admin ? (:

             Anyway...this map wasn't that hard..Took me only ten mins...
