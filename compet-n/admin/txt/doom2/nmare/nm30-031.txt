Description: Yes! I thought why the heck... This level is mine
             now and forever Kai! It wasn't that much harder
             in Nightmare, same tactics and everything, still
             it was a bit harder. Mostly because of the monsters
             shooting in your back all the time, this made it
             very hard to aim and especially the first 2 shoots
             were tough to get through..
