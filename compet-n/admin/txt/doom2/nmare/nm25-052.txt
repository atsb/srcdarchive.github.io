C-N entry #195.

More random recording, I got the
shaft trying to get out with the
blue key (forced back in by the
lower monsters) but otherwise it
went fine.

Don't expect anything special for
lmp #200 btw, I don't have any big
projects planned for now (and with
the way I've been recording a lot
lately, I wouldn't want to hold any
demos until I finished one).  Hmm,
I should be doing more stuff for the
scythe demopack though. :)
