Description: Not very nice looking style of playing, but I'll blame it on my own rustyness =)
	     It can easily go 1(2?) sec's faster with some patience and luck. Got 0:47 after 
             10min so 45sec should be a nice challange to take on, or how about it 
             Drew?, btw nice going with that nm02-048, great to see how other 
             fps players discover the art of doom =)
