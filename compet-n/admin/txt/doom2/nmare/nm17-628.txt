  Description:

  This is really a *very* nice map for NN-play - I love it.
  It's long, you've got no heavy weapons, and a lot of fun
  around. Actually it isn't as hard as it might first look.
  The latest "jump-version" is from the master himself...

[ Ah yes... I recorded this as a candidate for a "D2S-Free"
  and so there is this silly DHT D2S-AAK dancing in it...
  Oops Mr. Admin, I hope you don't mind this too much. :-) ]
