  Description :-)

  Oh yeah.... I never thought one day I'll have the record of this
  map.... and I'm now proud that I have it; even if just for some days.
  Even though the times are hilariously fast compared to what was
  thought to be possible 3-2-1 years ago, this map is still something
  special in NightMare. So it makes me feel special to have the record,
  after the likes of Kai, DL, Peo, Istvan or Panter.

  I have to say thanks to Panter for his excellent end room route 
  in his Pacifist demo. On the other hand, I introduced a new trick
  (blue key pickup) so I think it's fair that I "stole" his route.

  I'm satisfied with my demo; but it's clear what time should be
  the real thing. I leave the optimizing to you guys.
