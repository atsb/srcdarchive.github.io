Yeah you are right Panter... 23 is impossible without Strafe50.
So I did like adam for lv30-030... i used Strafe50 for the long straight lines.
There are only 2 lines : - to grab the yellow key
                         - coming back to the blue door
Consequently each line saves 0.5 sec. => 0:22 might be possible on UV.
