  Description : Yes!!!! 
                Thanx for this one goes to Chris, his route is 
                great. Luck is only thing you need and
                I must admit that in this demo I had too much luck ;))).
                I did 3.08 after 5 or 6 tryes but under 3.00 was my wish 
                so I continue to play. For this one I needed 1 hour.
                It's hard to tell what would be the best time here because
                all depends on luck but I'm sure that around 2.30 would
                be insane.
                Enyone?
