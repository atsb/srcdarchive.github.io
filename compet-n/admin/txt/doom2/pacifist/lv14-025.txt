  Description :-)

  This trick is not new, it's a Jonathan Rimmer
  rocketjump of course and has been around in
  /misc and also in the Nostalgic tricks section.
  
  However this is the first speedrun of it,
  mainly coming from the idea that you can substitute
  the soulsphere for a megaarmor (duh) and still pull
  off the jump.
  
  Oh yeah, and this one is Pacifist too :-)
