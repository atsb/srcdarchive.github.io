Description:

When I once recorded this map (right after ending the D2S) I was very
proud to beat Kai's older time which was about 1:10 I guess with a
typical never-ending Kai-txt ;-). But as usual Daniel made the same
route in 2 (or even 1 =8-O) secs faster. When I uploaded the 0:58
Uwe's 3rd episode run was well known, so everybody knew that Uwe's
route is the faster one, however I thought :1st record this and safe
the other route if someone might beat this (what happened as mentioned).
So finally, will Daniel be able to beat this again ?! I am not sure about
1 or 2 secs are possible I think, the last part I ran with some wet feet...
(I can do it faster ... )

However the first passages are well done I think, but watch for yourself ...
