Comments: I made a PA03-043 some days ago, after some trying, but I never
          sent this to Rini. I looked at this recording tonight and saw
          a lot of things wrong with it. I was sure I could beat it by two
          or even three seconds, but it turned out I beat it by four. I am
          much happier with this recording.

          To make a good time on this level you need a lot of luck with the
          monster movement. You must be quick in the goodie cache, then
          charge through to the first blue door without blockage (making
          sure you grab the blue key). Then rely on luck in the corridor
          behind the blue door and in the outside area just after that.
          The worst thing is if the demons block your way to the red door
          at the end.
