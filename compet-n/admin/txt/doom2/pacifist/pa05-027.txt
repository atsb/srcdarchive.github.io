Description: YEAH.....!!!!!!!!!!
             
             After 2 hours of playing I did it. Mostly luck but hell 
             this wasn't easy.I never got the Sedloïs "small trick"  
             with imps at the end. I must speculate and use my 
             own "small trick". :)) Is fast and easy. Sedlo was slow 
             when he go through the troopers.More times I got 29 , 
             never 28 and now ...                        
             OK guys, I know 26 is possible.  
             Sedloïs time beaten by 2 sec.s :))
             Anyway , only one sec away from d2dq , but in Pasifist. :))
