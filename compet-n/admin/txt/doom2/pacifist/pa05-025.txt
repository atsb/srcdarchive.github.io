  Description :)

  Today, I played a map01 pwad in prboom+ -complevel 2, after
  finishing it and starting on map02 I said I'll speedrun the
  next few maps especially since I'm training on and off for
  a 30uv run which I might never finish :|

  When I reached map05, I wanted to try Sedlo's tirck to get
  past the 2 imps without killing them, I didn't find it too 
  hard as I thought, I continued speedrunning that map with
  iddqd just for fun without recording :)

  Within ten minutes I did awesome running and very good trick,
  when I was on the rising platform near yellow key, I said this
  one is 25 for sure, I opened door, activated switch and I was
  SHOCKED, I got 24 !!! That's the previous record by Sedlo
  without Vile's monster glide trick ;)
  Maybe if it was a real run I wouldn't survive the run cause
  I had iddqd but who knows ;)

  I wanted to try speedrunning that map pacifist style in
  doom2.exe cause the previous record 0:27 by Bolton was bad imo

  This time I wasn't so lucky it took me 4 hours for this, I had
  many better running before, some were perfect, but I didn't have
  enough health to survive after getting yellow key, these zombies
  usually deal a lot of damage when you don't kill them in pacifist.

  Anyone wanna do Vile's monster glide and get past the 2 imps
  at the end pacifist style ? That should be very hard :)
