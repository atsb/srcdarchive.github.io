Well, a new compet-n guy...and czech, another new nationality? Not sure :).
I saw this demo in incoming, thought i'd beat it...first I used Jaromir's
route and got 0:56, then I wondered if i could use the speedrun route...
got a 0:52 with a few problems, then decided to go for under 0:50...after
a LOT of bad luck (twice reached the last lift and got killed by the pain
elemental, once survived all the way to the blue door without being hit and
died 1 sec after opening it, once turned the corner to the room with the
pointless secret with 35% health and died...) I got this run. 3 secs slower
than the speedrun record, not bad eh? :)
