  Description: Hehe, this is what I call real run. ((;
               I beat Panter's time after few tries and got 1.02 and
               then I thought that the best time should be 1.00.
               Soon I did 1.01 but that wasn't good for me ( I wanted 
               1.00), but few atempts latter I did this run. :)))
               I think that this time is unbeatable but try it if you
               don't belive me. ;))))
