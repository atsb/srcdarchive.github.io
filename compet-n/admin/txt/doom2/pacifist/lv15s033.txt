                           --------


Description: I got a 34 (which beats Kai's 35) fairly easy...but I thought a 33
             is also possible. So I tried to push it a bit more...

             Uhh I realized that it isn't necessary to kill a single monster,
             and so I didn't (do you read me Rini ?).
             I begin to like speedrunnning in this map...NMSpeed, CoopSpeed,
             NormalExitSpeed...and now with Secret Exit. (:
