    Description: :-)

		 Finally it's done...

		 I first wanted to do this demo after reading Rini's p1m7 
		 .txt :) This was about three months ago - so I'm not fast!

		 About this demo: I only arrived at this route a few days 
		 ago. What really helps is getting the supercharge. It's 
		 possible to do the level without it - I had several tries
                 getting right to the final room - but you're making things 
		 harder for yourself. It's NOT possible to leave the blue
		 armor - too much of your time is spent under fire from 
                 troopers and shotgunners and chainers. I came up with this 
		 route after MUCH trial and error, and substantial 
	         improvements will need a lot of luck.

		 The final demo doesn't look too hard - but I had luck at a 
		 number of key points, such as running past the chaingunners 
		 on the ramparts. Once you get the invuln, however, if your 
		 route is right you're home free...

		 This is probably my last COMPET-N recording... it just takes 
		 up too much time. Plus, the current crop of players have 
		 almost supernatural ability. I only stuck to undone tasks 
		 because they didn't have times to beat :) Thx to everybody 
		 who's recorded great demos for DooM, without them I would 
		 never have pushed myself so far.
