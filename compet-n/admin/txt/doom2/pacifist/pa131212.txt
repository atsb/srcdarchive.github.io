  Description:  
 This is very long (12mins) and boring, lot of corner inspecting, but I
 had to do it... ;-)
 This collection is just to show that a map is possible or not, so it is!
 I hate those spiders, they always killed my favorite cacco before he
 entered the yellow key room. And I hate those blocking imps at the yellow
 yellow key platform too!
