  Doom2 - Level 03

                     Time   00:28.40

Description: Yeah, it really IS the end of the world...I recorded a new LMP!
             Someone in #nightmare was trying pa03, so I thought I'd have
             a quick look at it...made 0:34 in prboom in Linux, so I thought
             what the hell and rebooted to Windows to have a proper go at it.
             So, down goes the second-oldest pacifist Doom2 record! (Oldest
             is MAP01 of course :>). The big pick-up over Panter's demo isn't
             actually the different route at the blue key area, but the route
             change at the start - this saves a second or so. I had a 29.00
             using Panter's start route, so 27 is certainly possible. It's an
             annoying run, though.
