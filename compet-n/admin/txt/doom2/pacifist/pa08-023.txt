Description:
  A very tricky map, there's no reliable way to get
  past the imps, you just have to go for it and hope
  you get lucky.  This equals the speed record, which
  is hardly surprising as there is no real need to
  shoot monsters if everything goes well.  0:22 is
  certainly possible, since the Cyb/Baron and exit
  rooms did not go as well as they could have.
