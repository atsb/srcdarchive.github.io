 Description: 

  Ha, well, I was only kidding with all that chaingunner malarkey. Who needs
  'em? :). As I mentioned to Vince, a run on this route using the speedrun
  ending (and coming back from blue key a little quicker than I do here)
  could break the speedrun record...anyone want to try? Sorry for the slow
  ending, but I messed it up 3 times before this and wanted to get it this
  time. Nice 1% health finish :)
