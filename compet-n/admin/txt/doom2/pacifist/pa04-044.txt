  Time:    0:44

Description:

Thought i'd improve my time here before anyone else did. Only major
difference between this run and 0:50 was something someone (forgotten who,
sorry) pointed out to me - if you raise the yellow key bridge before making
the final jump and opening the exit door, the pinkie will run straight out
along it, making things just a bit easier in the exit room. Again did the
jumps very slowly, cos I missed them four times tonight...used strafe50 for
the second one (across the yellow key itself) this time, just to be sure.
