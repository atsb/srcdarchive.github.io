Description:

Yes Radek, this one is really more interesting to play than cl27, especially
while "I should" defend my 1,16 run. I knew there are some mistakes in my 
pa09-116, but in fact I didn't think that someday will come someone crazy 
enough to play and beat it. Donno why but I did this one really quickly, 
I just have to say "Thank you for giving a notice about it" -> SMS :p 
Don´t you think that we can do everything better as a team ? so don´t 
forget to tell next time :P
Sorry, no beer, no Jacih this time, don´t need such a corrupt elements :P

Cheers ! :P
