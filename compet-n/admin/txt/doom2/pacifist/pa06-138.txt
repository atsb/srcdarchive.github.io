  Description :-)

  Another hard run with lots of monsters blocking the way.
  I spend less time in the red key room than Jaromir, partly
  because of the technique I use to deal with the Imps in the
  corridor on the way back (just running past them instead of
  having them following me down the elevator and into the room).
