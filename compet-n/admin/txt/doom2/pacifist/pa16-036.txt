Description: I KNEW this was possible! :). After trying a lot on the normal
             route, and getting nowhere, I decided to have a go without
             the invulnerability. I got a 0:40 first try (luck :>), then a
             0:39, then about an hour and a half later, *finally* got this
             :). Four major problems in this demo: getting the blue key,
             getting into the red key room (harder without invuln, as the
             revenants are dangerous), and getting up the last lift - only
             just managed it here :). Don't know what's possible here,
             maybe 0:33?
