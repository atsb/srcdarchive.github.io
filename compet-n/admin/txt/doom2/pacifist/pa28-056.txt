Map 28 finished in 0:56 Pacifist style.

At the beginning I look like I've lost my way
but I'm just activating the pink demons so I
won't get stuck on my way to the exit.

Although requiring the detour as preparation 
this route is a little bit faster. My best time
the long way round on the traditional Pacifist
route is 1:02. In fact, when I last tried to 
beat that time I got no better than 1:05.
