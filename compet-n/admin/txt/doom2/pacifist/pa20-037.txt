  Description : 

Here is how to make this level easier.
I made it with 20%, rare for me (usually i don't make it at all), and
I didn't ever need that extra 10% (MMH 27% i think)

New techniques:

Shooting the wall past the tport while sinking to wake the
monsters earlier, so that you can hide behind the shotgunners.

Doing the megasphere detour.  Loses a very little bit of time than a jump
(but if you do the whole circuit, you don't lose ANY time) but then you
have 200/200 and it isn't difficult anymore.  You can sit in the lava and
wait for the wall to sink, or you can try to time it from the megasphere
platform.

See the attached ak20t.lmp for another trick that is unfortunately too slow
to be important, except perhaps in MAX or something.
