  Description:

  pa26: that other undone pacifist. There
  has been some mention of pa02 from time
  to time, but pa26 has often been neglected.
  I think this map is easier than pa02, but
  I haven't tried pa02 much so I don't really
  know how hard it is. With this route things
  ought to be straightforward, but sometimes
  that crap across the water won't shoot
  or a caco will try to enter the exit with
  you leaving 2 unpleasant choices: block him
  so that he can only back out and take damage
  in the process, or try to pass him and then
  you've lost a key hiding spot and are stuck
  with a useless caco. Also, sometimes you're
  left with a stray imp or skull which can
  really screw things up when there's no cacos
  to take it out. One time that happened to me
  after taking the red key. I then tried to
  take the blue key without success. This time
  I use a more reliable method of using the
  caco to distract the baron and the rest worked
  out on the first try.
