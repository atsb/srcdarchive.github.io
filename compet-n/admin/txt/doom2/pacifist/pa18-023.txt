Description: I still can't belive that I did it,
             but I knew that is possible, and I did it w/o strafe50
             driver, hehe. This map is eazy for speed run if you want 24
             but for 23 you need big luck. First I started to play with
             DL's route but after 2 hours I started to belive that 23 is
             really impossible but then I come up on a new way and it works.
             It's a small change but makes run 10 times harder.
             This is my second entry and again unbeatable :)).  
             PS. This is also a pacifist style, sorry Mummi ;))).
