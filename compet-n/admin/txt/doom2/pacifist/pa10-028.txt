Description:

Uff, needed luck, especially the exit part, installing monster
teleports with Cybie here was not good idea really.

I also included one more file into this zip, much interesting I
think, is it map10 done pacifist, just watch the health during
exiting/intermission - its RECHARGING ! :)) -> pa10cool.lmp !
