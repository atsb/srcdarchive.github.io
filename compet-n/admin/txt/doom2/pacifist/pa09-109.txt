Description: Hi again, man, I can see on my mobile phone screen "The SMS
             has just been sent to Bolton". You know what that means. :)
             I bet you didn't expect that I could strike back so soon, did
             you ? But I quite like this map, so i just gave another try
             to it and as it seems it wasn't a bad idea. I think we should
             get the time down to 1:05 or so, it's definitely possible.
             Watch my demo, I got stuck by pigs again, lost 2 sec. at least,
             also I could have been faster in the blue-key room. 
             I'm not a good speedrunner, I'm just trying to force people
             like you to improve their records and it works. Have to go
             now and look for another pacifist to beat.
