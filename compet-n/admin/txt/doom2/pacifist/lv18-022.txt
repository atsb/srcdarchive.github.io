  About fucking time those stupid cacos and/or imps let
  me by. Roughly qwazillion times they blocked my way. 
  It was frustrating the shit out of me at times. Anyway,
  with the help of strafe50 (which I did not use), 21 is 
  possible. Maybe even without, but...  Oh yeah, this is
  also a pacifist entry.
