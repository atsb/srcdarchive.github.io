Description : 

Sedlo was really happy here that he was under par, my goal was
to be under 2 minutes which I did not manage :(
Definitely is possible to get at least 1,50 this way, just watch
the mistakes I did damnit, why should I always do them ?!
Perhaps I am a lame ...
One year ago I did 2,12 and 2,10 and sometimes I just tried to improve it,
this time I lost all my nerves, something just could not work as it should,
thats what happened everytime, while is all ok and you already got the key
(yellow one) you get blocked either even in the room or outside. This pissed 
me off totally.  
I used a bit different way of getting the key than Sedlo. It needs invisiblity 
to make the caco hit that spurious imp insted of waiting for him
to hit caco. But dont think it works everytime you want, 
you still need a good luck really.
