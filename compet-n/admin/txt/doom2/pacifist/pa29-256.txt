Description :

Yes, we finally have 1st ever pacifist run of map29 !
and it was my honour to do it, now I tell you how it 
happened. I was just looking for some pacifist to play,
there are four hard maps left to do 02/17/26/29. We already
have some cheated lmps (TAS) that proves it isnt impossible
to do it without cheating, but after a while of thinking
about realizing map02 and map17 I left all the thoughts of
trying it. So maps 26/29 are those I could try, map26 hinges
at two hard points, getting thru the line of imps to the
redkey and picking up the bluekey that is guarded by baron.
Its real hell to do this map pacifist, by many other players
is it also marked as impossible. Map29 seemed less hazardous
to me so I started with trying - it was maybe one year ago !
I found out that the start of the map is pretty fortuneous,
and that is possible to reach the mancubi place with some low
health. I never got farther than here before. This time I
took it seriously and after about three hours of playing I
firstly reached Archie place :P It took another days
and another hours to get farther into "FJS room", there, I was
lucky at everything except of FJS jump. Mancubi, being busy
with shotgunners, left immediatelly the place for me, so the
baron above the lift, then windowjump came so easy.
Pity that I missed the last jump :( Ofcourse I kept on trying
till today, after some failed attempts I reached there
again. Though that the mancubi didnt leave the way and fired
me I was lucky and I managed to get out of there alive.
Then came that hard jump combination, I was nervous a bit I
remember, but at last it happened good for me :P

Here is a text by Selim "Bastard" Benabdelkhalek taken off his
cheated pa29-530, I can agree with him and I like his text very
much so I hope I could copy the text here ...
