Demo entry #13.

Description:

Not one of my better optimized demos (would aim for sub-2:00 with serious
playing), but strangely this first-exit run is a Golden Cyber award demo beater.

I didn't want to cross the place with imps and a skeleton twice, so after
pressing the switch, I jump down to the rising bridge and beat about there with
dragon heads (cacodemons) around me! This fight will be pure torture unless you
know your right trajectory on those ledges, which I have discovered after a few
hours of playing. Still not very easy, but a few times I survived it without
getting hit.

This is the second time I reached the upper area. Not that I
missed the FJS jump in the previous attempt, but I was killed by
the hellknight :(

Thanks to Selim "Bastard" Benabdelkhalek for those compliments (he said that
it's an experience for "Compet-N monsters" and requires "high monsters fighting
skills, a good slalom skill, and first of all incredible luck"). Enjoy the pain!
