Description: Amazing jump, this, invented by Ilya Britvich. Incredibly hard,
             too. Esko was really unlucky that he hit the imps in his run,
             this is basically exactly the same only I don't
             hit any imps at the rising platform. Credit to Ilya for the jump,
             and Esko for the route. AFAIK this is the third released demo
             which achieves this jump with monsters, after Esko's lv19-041 and
             and his 0:41 in D2DQ.
