Description:    Oh man, I'm really an expert now for every scene up to the
                last room, but this one is a real mess with all these Dudes.
                But finally I made it to the end. Dunno if one should rate
                this map, up to the second megasphere it's medium to hard,
                but the yellow door room is hard to survive with 200%.
                Maybe it's one of the hardest, dunno how difficult is e3m8.
                You need quite a lot of luck here.
                Just the tips to complete this map:
                Run quick past the 1st sergeant, sometimes the Revenant will
                not see you. Then (on the way down or up) stand the way one of
                the Imps next to the Supercharge can see you (not necessary,
                you can awake them later when you've taken the blue key).
                When you've jumped and pressed the button, wait a bit, because
                if the Spider starts to shot, she will only hit the Pigs.
                Most of the time you can survive with your 100% then.
                Take thew Supercharge, just easier to run back then.
                I recommend to take the Megasphere now, pass the blue door,
                and have the sergeant be hit. Stand at the right side, and run
                past the 3 sergeants to the left to the wall, wait there until
                there is a gap to the left of the Imps, and the remaining 2
                sergeants always ( :) stand in your way.
                Have all Dudes killed but one, who will be killed by sergeant
                Imp. At least that's the best way. If not, maybe the way it's
                done here. Take the 2(!) medkits, and kill the 3 Imps (I'm
                pacifist :), then take the red key or the megasphere if you
                must, and have the Lost Soul and the remaining Imps killed.
                If all 3 spectres are hit, you can simply wait in the corner
                (I tried to hit them with the Revenants and gave that up after
                the 1st hit.) Then there will be the difficult part, and I've
                got no tips, how to complete it, I leave it to those who
                will (have to) play that map.
