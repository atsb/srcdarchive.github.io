C-N entry #189.

Credit goes to Bolton for being 
the first ever to pull off this
touchy bitch of a run.  All I
really wanted was a smooth demo
without a missed FJS jump, which
I didn't think would give me so
much grief after doing it in the
nm29 and 30uv.  It's probably
because the shotgunners I got to
shoot down beforehand are ready to
return the favor with some really
mean payback.  Oh well, some cacos
were also more of a problem than
usual, but what are ya gonna do in
pacifist. :)
