Destription:

 Yesssss:)). Both Archie jumps O.K. :)). I have much 51 without the second jump,
 one in 50 and one with the jump in 49. The end is not perfect, but to do both 
 jump is hard. I think it is much harder then the archie jump in 14, because 
 this one did I in one hour in 31s. The Spirit World took three days:)
 I hope Iïm first who do this :)). Because when somebody beat this one, I will 
 be in nostalgic:)). When I saw pa28-051 by Henning, I never thought Iïm able 
 to beat it. 
 But i discover this second jump:). I think this trick could be possible in 
 category speed to, but it is work for AdamH.:))). I canït understand how he did
 his 41s.
