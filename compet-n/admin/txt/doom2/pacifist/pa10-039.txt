  Description:  Got some luck and could take the left (short) way to the
                secret passage after grabbing the yellow key. I even used
                some fast (=50) keyboard strafing, don't know if this
                really helps. Anyway, four seconds faster than my previous
                fastest, I don't believe I can do it any faster.
		
		Btw: 
		only two seconds slower than the COMPET-N speed record.
