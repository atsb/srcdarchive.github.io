Description:

Well, another tough one, I do agree Oyvind.
These facts took me away off optimal time:
-In the beginning I was seen by skeleton and stopped by him on the way back,
 where I did also a few unimaginable maneuvers.
-While coming back from megasphere there was a shotgunner in my way,
 and then I had some troubles with those brown idiots above the lift.
 The end worked OK I think.
Anyway, this point is back in Pilsen :P
