 Description: 
              
        In fact the archie jump is not so.... the only hard points
        is to have enough health... :
                  - obviously to survive the jump :)
                  - and to finish the level

        I did the jump around 20 times with only one success ! 
        Exit under fire ! (down to 1% when exiting).
        The main problem is that chaingunner on the lift... here 
        i try to make him shoot the imps... it works some time...
        but he didn't => 2-3 sec lost ??
