  Description:  
	In this lmp I used keyboard strafing for
	the long runs outside otherwise it's all mouse
	strafing.
	Next time I'll be 3 seconds faster in the exit
	room plus 1 second for keyboard strafing between
	blue and yellow keys!
	BTW: You can get the yellow key from outside the
	back wall of that small room. I never get any
	advantage out of it so I take it the traditional
	way - through the door.
