  Description: 
                          free: "Barrels of Fun"            (map23-p.lmp)
                                 Enough nightmares! After map04 I didn't like
                                 to record something too difficult. This was
                                 fun and very easy. Time is not too bad.
                              
                                 Btw: Watch how often my shots miss in map04
                                 (once it was believed that one HAS to aim
                                 well when playing nightmare - I proved that
                                 opinion wrong)
                                 so I better play pacifist, there it doesn't
                                 matter how bad my aiming is ;-)
