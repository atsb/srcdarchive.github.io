Description:  Hello Bolton, what are you doing ? Still playing Cl27 ? Man,
              I found something better to play, guess what ? I'm sorry, but
              that demo really needed improvement, especially if that demo
              was recorded on 2nd January, 2000. I bet you were drunk like 
              me, weren't you ?? Weren't you ?? And also Jacih was making
              you nervous, I can imagine that.
 
              The demo is far from perfect, I got stuck a couple of times.
              But you know, I suck in Pacifist, even if I like playing that.
              I hope you will redo it soon, else I will. :) Bye bye and
              keep on drinking man!
