Description: O.K. This "txt" will be very special:). Here is jacih:)
             I was sitting beside Bolton and I canït believe what I 
             just saw. I know how long he play it:))).But he will 
             write that he play it for two hours. But donït believe him:))
    	     So my favourite lmp in COMPET-N has born:). I saw on my own eyes
             his birth - it was very bloody:)))). I think very nice start to 
             new year.
 
  Bolton:   Sedloïs lmps seems perfect and unbeatable. But this one not:))) 
            Only 7s slower than UV-speed. Maybe next stop?? My favorite 
            level , but not in pasifist mode :)  I was so nervous 
            in the end, because all was perfect and jacih was seeing to this, 
            breathing to my ear and catching my hands and told me how he 
            welcame new year, altough I was there with him:))  hehehe
            This is that why I forgot my authenticial dance:)))
            
            Sorry for the mistake in my last "pa05-027.txt" I wrote that     
            Sedlo play this level in 29, but it was Panterïs work.
