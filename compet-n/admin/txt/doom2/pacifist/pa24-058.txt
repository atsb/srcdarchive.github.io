  Description:

  Yep. Under one minute. That's what I wanted when I started
  recording. I realized this to be possible, when I first
  played with BFG instead of rockets. Strange to me is the
  fact that from the first door to the teleporter, where I
  enter the room with the pinkies, I'm almost 3 seconds faster
  than Kai-Uwe. Well, this isn't the fastest .LMP for this
  part, so there still should be room for some seconds.
  Something for you, Kai-Uwe ??? Not for me, I really hate
  this map (it makes me pretty nervous).
