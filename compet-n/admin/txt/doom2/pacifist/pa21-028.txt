  Looks easy, huh? Believe it or not, but getting this 0:28 required
  THOUSANDS of attempts, due to the insane amount of luck involved.

  I figured this was going to be a fun project, but boy oh boy was I
  wrong. This run is one annoying bitch.

  I had practised the glide through the yellow bars quite a lot al-
  ready in December 2002, so I knew that wasn't going to be a problem.
  It soon became apparent, however, that it wasn't going to be easy
  getting those stupid imps to understand that blowing up a barrel is
  a lot more fun than just moving one around a bit. Those chaingunners
  guarding the red key also didn't seem to know that it's polite to
  step aside when someone's coming through with his ass on fire.

  After seeing mr. Razak's demo, I played pa21 for some 4-5 days back
  in June, wasting a total of maybe 12 hours on it. I did get a few
  0:29's which were slightly faster than mr. Razak's, and eventually
  also a 0:29.08. In the latter, I had more or less perfect luck with
  the imps and chaingunners, but managed to screw up in a very annoying
  manner later on in the run. Having totally messed up a potentially
  good looking 0:28, I got pissed off and abandoned the project.

  In October, I happened to notice that I wasn't quite as pissed off
  anymore, so I decided to give pa21 another shot. I played it a lot
  during one day in October and two days in November, and finally got
  this 0:28 on November the 16th, 2003.

  The glide went well, I had fantastic luck with the imp-barrel, but
  trying to break through to the red key at the most crowded spot in
  the whole map might not have been too smart. ...but whatever... I
  suppose the backup route I used might not even have been clear half
  a second earlier. I'm just not going to do another couple of thousand
  attempts, waiting for better luck.

  Oh, by the way, I suppose this is my first single player Compet-N
  contribution (not counting contest demos).
