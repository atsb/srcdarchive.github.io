  I saw this demo in incoming, thought i'd beat it...first I used Jaromir's
  route and got 0:56, then I wondered if i could use the speedrun route...
  got a 0:52 with a few problems, then decided to go for under 0:50...after
  a LOT of bad luck (twice reached the last lift and got killed by the pain
  elemental, once survived all the way to the blue door without being hit and  
  died 1 sec after opening it, once turned the corner to the room with the
  pointless secret with 35% health and died...) I got this run. 3 secs slower
  than the speedrun record, not bad eh? :)


  Yes new nationality. Czech republic !!. After a lot of bad luck and after 
  two hours of playing I did 47 twice(and one about three month old). I didnït 
  know, if I should try it again. But I was sure I can do it, cause I had 
  speed run recording by myself in 46s. So I played another half hour....
  2 secs slower than the speed run record, not bad eh?:)
  
  Second entry today. I think I will start to play DooM again:))
