  Description : Hell, whats wrong with me today. This is my fourth demo
                ( buy the way again I beat Henning's time, sorry man ! ).
                Yesterday I was trying to beat this 3 hours and only 
                did 35 and today I needed 1 hour for this, hmm strange.
                Ok, never mind that. I sed in my pa16-042.txt that when 
                somebody beat my time I will do my best and here it is.
                
                Henning wanna go for 32, belive me that will probably
                take more than 10 minutes ;))).
