Thank Dashiva for this one, since he
recently conducted a rather daunting
investigation calculating the possible
player speeds under certain conditions.
In short, he concluded that the st50
jump from the edge of the mancubus
platform to the ending ledge is indeed
possible, though it requires a bit of
divine intervention on the engine's
part (ie really good luck).  I believe
he is correct, though for the sake of
my own sanity, I also came up with my
own spin on the jump by keeping the
rocket jump, but just not using an enemy
like Sedlo does in the UV speed record.

It's definitely not easy, and as such,
this run is far from optimized.  I didn't
make the jump until the third attempt, and
my health when I hit the exit is pretty
funny, but I didn't harm a hair on those
shambling fatsos.  Hurrah! ;)

I also included the original nomonsters
demo where I made the jump, which is the
first of its kind.  That demo didn't take
very long, but this run took a few hours...
Sedlo wouldn't have taken so long, for sure.
