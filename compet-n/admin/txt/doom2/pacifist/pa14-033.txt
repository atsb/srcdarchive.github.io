Destription:
 This route is pretty though, I think:-). The jump is realy long:)). I think
 the longest jump you can do in DooMII. And I mean that this one is a little
 bit harder than speedrun-route-jump. But I am not sure. But I know,that my way 
 is about 2-3 seconds slower than classic speedrun-route.My speed record of this 
 map is 31s. 
 Running my route you have better chance to finish this map, because you can 
 pick up the supercharge.
