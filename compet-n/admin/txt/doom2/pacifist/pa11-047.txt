Description: This map is Circle of Death indeed. I died thousand times
             at least. I should be happy that I finally did it, but look at
             the time, I feel pissed off a bit. Anyway, I slightly changed the
             route, because in my opinion there was no reason for picking up
             the green armor and supercharge. You need enough health just to 
             get through the Cacos room, then you need LOT of luck. I had two 
             faster demos, but spider always killed me. (note: I didn't 
             use IDDT.)
