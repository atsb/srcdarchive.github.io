 Description:

  I saw Sedloïs 59 and I thought, that faster route is with megasphere, so I 
  try it, but a lot of runs ended by the barrel or by chaingunners. I had luck
  in this one, that the imps shoot the barrel so quickly:). I think I can beat 
  Sedlo with the same route, but i had no luck with the barrel. I lost there 
  allways 4 or 5s and I did times around 1:02 - 1:05s. 
   I try it with -nomonsters and I got with megasphere 48 and by Sedloïs route
  52. So it is both 6s difference between nomonsters and yesmonsters:))). So I 
  think the time is O.K.
