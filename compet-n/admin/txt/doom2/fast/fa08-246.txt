===================================
Description:

This run depended on infighting in the cyber's room. It would have been 
desirable to be a situation where the rest of enemies could be killed 
with one shot of BFG, but the result of the infighting in this run was 
not too bad. The monitor room had pain elementals and cacodemons was 
crazy from lost souls. I dealt with the enemies with only three shots 
of BFG. It was so smooth. I was a little upset by a lost soul before 
the exit, but I managed to survive and get this good record.
