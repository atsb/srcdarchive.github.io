[  Admin. Note :-)  Unless you have already completed this Out-of-Base
   for YOUR DHT D2GM exam or do NOT intend to do so, I don't think you
   should watch this .LMP - Alternatively, Peo deserves a BIG credit !

   Just IMHO... but I could write TONNES about DHT being unfair... ;-)

  Description :-)

  I know that "Anthe" and "Demonlord" can do this one in less than 10
  minutes, but this is the first time I beat this "mother of all levels"
  and I was scared shitless the entire level, which you can see !!!

[  Admin. Note :-)  I would have held this .LMP, of an Out-of-Base DHT
   D2GM exam, back until after Peo had the chance to complete his exam
   but it was already available from "cdrom"... So what can I do ? ;-)

   Besides, "Demonlord" HAS, also, completed this D2GM level, in 9:58,
   AND *I* am NOT going to reject his .LMP's just because I don't like
   the look of his initials...

   See LV13-TGM.TXT !!!
