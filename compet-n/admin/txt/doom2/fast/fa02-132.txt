  Description :-)

  Same route as my LV02-132  -  which most of you won't know, as it
  never made its way to ftp.cdrom.com actually ...  found out about
  Daniel's LV02-128 in the latest CURRENT.TAB (LATEST??! It's dated
  31/May, file date 13/Jun, and it was d/l-able only on 03/Jul!! Oh
  well, I guess my  "fragging moaning"  won't help much either. ;-)
  Anyway ... "Thank you, Daniel!" :-)

  So what's this LV02-!!! all about then? Well, I decided to put it
  into the .ZIP as a "bonus track"  -  it's a nice bug that occured
  during my LV02 session, and I have NO idea what happened.  All of
  a sudden, *everything*  (ie. me & the monsters) went NoClip ... I
  couldn't press switches or open doors anymore,  and the monsters'
  far attacks didn't do any damage to me  -  near attacks still did
  though. Sadly enough, none of  *my*  attacks could hurt a monster
  either :-( so I finally got ripped to shreds by an imp or two.

  [ .BAT stuff snipped for briefness - it was getting old anyway! ]
