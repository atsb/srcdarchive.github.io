Description: This took me some houers to finich, there are some tricky 
             situations, you also have to learn the monsters moves. Were they
             go when they are coming etc....The route haven't been worked out
             in details yet, I belive Peo got 06:12, haven't watched his yet 
             becorse I think it's kind of interesting comparing the LMPS 
             afterwords and see how he solves it :)

             btw, Those Lost Souls can go straight to Hell.....IMO it is the
             most annoying "ohh my ass" monster in the history of all 3d\2d
             games. 
             ................and remember while watching the demo, I just did
             this for fun so do NOT excpect what we call it "a good demo".
