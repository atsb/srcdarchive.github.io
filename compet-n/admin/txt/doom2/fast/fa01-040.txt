  Description:

  I'd say this came a bit faster than I expected.
  When I tried this at first, I got a 42, which was
  not so good, so I decided to improve it.  I decided
  that 41 would not look so good, so I went for 40.
  This run is only moderately hard to survive, but it
  is slightly slower than the UV run.  The main problem
  is that the first imp doesn't like to move so that I
  can saw him when the lift is down.  The 2 imps on the
  way to the shotgun also seem harder to saw quickly
  because they don't move.  This demo is pretty good.
  The only real problem is I needed an extra shot on 
  one of the wimps so that forced me to take a slightly
  slower way back from the armor secret.
