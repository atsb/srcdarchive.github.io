Description: This is just crap....Don't waste your time.
             I only reached the exit one time, and btw this map is very 
             boring. I had trouble with my shotgun ammo at the end so I lost 
             some time here. 
         
             Thanks Peo for the route, it's the same route as in uv mode but
             you have to pick up some more ammo there and there....
