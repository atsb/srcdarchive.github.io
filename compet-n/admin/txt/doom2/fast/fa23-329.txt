Description:  This was just the result of a Dang session, I wanted to do
              this Claudio's way (not getting the shotgun). After a short
              while I got 3:57, done very slowly and with some pretty hilarious
              errors. This is the result of trying to do it fast. It's a big
              improvement over Henning's time (/me happy) but most of that is
              just route improvement. And there's no need to worry about using
              rockets on the PEs, this almost never goes wrong (unless a demon
              shows up...)
