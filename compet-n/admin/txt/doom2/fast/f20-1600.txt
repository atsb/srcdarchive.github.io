  Description :-)  The start is excellent, with me running around Cybie's
  legs to open up the Archie and the Baron (Sounds like names from a gang
  names from a gang of English robbers, doesn't it ? ;-)  After that my
  problems begin and since it is a first time with -Fast I didn't have a
  plan. Cybie was also tougher than expected - I thought the spiderdemon
  would have softened him up more.  Anyway, the only critical point came
  when I screwed up the jump down to the second painelemental. After that
  I was "home" - You can also tell that it is a first try, since I stop
  and "think" sometimes !
