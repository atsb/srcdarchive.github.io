  Description :-)

  Basically Henning's route, some lucky BFG's on my way and a more efficient
  usage of rockets. Ilya's way could be faster, however running through
  the demons with a single chaingun needs awesome luck.
  Think this can be done faster but I'm satisfied with the time here,
  and I don't think I'll ever try this map again for -fast. Henning it's your
  turn!
