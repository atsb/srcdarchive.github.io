  Description :-)

                   This is a fun map to do, lots of action,
  benefits of doing it -Fast: quicker internal killing,
  the downside: quicker killing of the marine, whoops,
  thank god for the old viking-weapon, the Berserk. ;-)
  That saved me on this one. I'm afraid I do the old routine
  too much ie. checking for forgotten friends...
