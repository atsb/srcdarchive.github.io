Description:  I was just trying to improve my time for dang, and got
              a 6:42 on my second try - one second outside the record.
              Soon after I had a 6:06, with lots of falldowns, plus
              Archie getting me twice. Now I'm happy. I play the start
              fairly slowly - but the extra cells speed things up later
              on.
