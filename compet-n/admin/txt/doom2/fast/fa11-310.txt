Description: I like this map, and belive it or not: It's very easy when playing
             -fast monsters. I managed to beat DL's 04:26 from 96' on first 
             try, so I had a few attempts afterwords and ended up with 03:10.
             I think somewhere around 02:40 is quit possible.....
