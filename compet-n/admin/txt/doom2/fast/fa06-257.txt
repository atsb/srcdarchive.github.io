Description: Quit easy map in -fast mode...
             I think it's time to improve my uv-max entry since nobody else
             bother to do it :)

             It took me about 10 min to to this, I had trouble getting that 
             dam strafe with the lift to work, also the second megasphere
             jump can be tricky sometimes......

             Heia Norge :) I discoverd that Norway is leading compet-n now, 
             thanks to Anders and Jan Endre...:-)
