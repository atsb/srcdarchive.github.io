  Description :-)  I don't know what to say about this map, it is very
  hard with -Fast!! Although I took a risky start that worked out well
  in the end, wasted too much ammo due to my not so skilled boxing with
  demons, I had to do that in the end because I was running out of ammo.
  This is a map I will never do again, I think ;-) Anyway I dislike the
  walls on this ugly map... Therefore the chainsawing at the end which
  of course was an expression of joy as well... I would really like to
  see this done in 15 minutes! Daniel?
