  Description :-)

  Oops! It seems that my old .LMP in this level [ FA03-158.LMP ] didn't
  -PlayDemo correctly. I was upset since I already uploaded it. So I decided
  that to make it up for everyone who was also upset because it didn't
  -PlayDemo correctly, I'll make it again even faster. It wasn't difficult
  (took me about 5 tries) and this is the result. I apologize for the first
  one - this one does -PlayDemo correctly, I verified it!

  The rest of the .TXT is the same as FA03-158.TXT.

  After doing LV03-202.LMP, LV03-155.LMP, LV03-029.LMP I was tired of this
  level but Peo Sjoblom has diverted my attention to this one with -FAST. I
  personally think that -FAST and NightMare are stupid, but this was very
  easy to do and I didn't try too much.

  It's much easier with -FAST since the monsters fight each other much more
  and much quicker so a lower time is possible. I won't play any more with
  -FAST unless someone requests that. I am not used to the monster movements
  so my aiming is terrible. Sometimes they move faster (demons) and
  sometimes they hardly move because they fire all the time (all the rest)
  so I have trouble deciding whether to change my aiming direction or not.
  It doesn't really matter.

  Note: I never uploaded LV03-155.LMP because before I had the chance to do
  that, Demonlord did LV03-153.LMP ;-(

  Please mail me with feedback!

[  Admin. Note :-(  FA03-158.LMP was simply DQ'd because it didn't
   -PlayDemo correctly. Bad .LMP's using a bad .WAD or .EXE or the
   wrong version of either simply get DQ'd. Use the LATEST version
   of DooM ] II [... and an *unmodified* version (of 1.9 - only).
