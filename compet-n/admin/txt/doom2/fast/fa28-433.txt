  Description :-) One of the easiest levels of the whole d2...
  With a better strategy it can be done in about 4 minutes, I
  have not played it for 8 months and was a bit rusty, I never
  have liked it vey much so I will not try to improve this.
  I actually did one that was 2 seconds faster but with 2
  terrible mistakes which especially one prominent doomer would
  have ROTFL at, I just will mention that misguided rockest
  were involved! ;-)) The reason I do all these pretty good
  -fast times now is thanks to Daniel, Kai, Istvan and Yonatan,
  they have shown that -fast are almost as fast as regular UV..:)
