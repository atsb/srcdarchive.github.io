  Description :-)
  
  This was the weakest of my MAP07 entries, so I decided to have another go.
  Still not perfect, I screwed up the arachnotron part pretty much (the mouse
  was going off the mousepad all the time). At least the mancubi went great.
  Still 0:54 is possible, but I hope this time is enough to prevent you guys
  steal that 0.5 point from me...
  This should be my last MAP07 entry until someone manages the multiplayer
  trick in single player too...
