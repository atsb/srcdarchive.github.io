  Description :-)

  Just two hours ago I wrote a txt for LV32-038:
  
  > Only -fast to go now...
  > Then this level shall be completely mine!
  
  ...and I got it! Four secs faster than DL... First I got a 0:40, but it was
  40.08 so I tried a bit more. Then I realized how to kill cybie... so I could
  reach 0:38 with 90+ % kills... And finally I got 100% kills and 0:38!

  IMHO 0:37 is optimal time for LV32 and FA32...
  But don't think it'll be easy :)

  THE TASK IS MADE.
  THIS LEVEL IS NOW COMPLETELY MINE!
