  Description:
  
  One could think this was hard, but not. I got this time after about
  20mins of playing, but couldn't improve it since then. In my opinion
  getting 1:10 on -fast mode is easier than getting times like 1:12 on
  regular UV skill, mainly because of useful infights. 
  btw. Sslasher, where are you?
