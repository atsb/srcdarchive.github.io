  Description :

  Well you might think, 44 is easy time for UV, so all I have to do is survive, but that
  is anything but the truth.  It's very annoying to saw all that stuff in the blue room
  and tends to take a bit more time than UV, especially when dodging imp fireballs.  And
  both RL shots are more tricky when the imps don't move normally.  Well anyways it's not
  perfect, so 43 or 42 should definitely be possible in theory, but it would be extremely
  difficult.  I suppose the alternate UV route could be faster here, but I doubt you could
  survive that with fast monsters.
