Description: Quite hard level when playing it with "-fast" monsters,
	     especially the start is VERY tricky, need some luck
	     to survive it..
	     My first try was at 10.47 but I only managed to get 
             94% secrets, so I had to rerecord it.
	     Most levels are quite easy with -fast if you learn them 
	     well, however... one single mistake and you're dead..
