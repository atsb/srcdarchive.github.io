Description: A very intersting map with -fast.... I just came up with a route 
             here, I think this could be done somewhere around 03:20..:)
	    
             Very easy to forget monsters here, so this is the first time I
             exit with 100% kills..  

             Hmmmm... I think it's time to do this one in uv-max kill, I know 
             that requiers luck, so I'm not sure if I am the man to do
             that mission......
