Description: After recording the coop - uv13net2 - I thought I could
             improve my own record. Changed the start and the time I
             jump to the chaingun. In the last record(ing) I used the
             Spider at the teleporter to kill at least one Revenant.
             Now I telefrag her. Sometimes she has already teleported
             but in 9 out of 10 attempts I have to wait. The other
             problem is to have the Revenants, Spiders and Cacos fight
             each other. Sometimes there is only one Revenant and that
             helps a lot, but not that often, if you don't waste time
             guiding a homing missile from the Revenant to a Spider.
             I recorded a 6:08 rather fast, but wasn't that happy with
             the time. I hope exactly 6 minutes is OK :)
