Description:

I take a slightly different route at the start here, going straight
for the teleporter.  If you do this, make sure you get the shells by
the revenants or you'll run out!  The only annoyance here is that
baddies teleport all over the place, but I think it's faster.  Sometimes
you can get lucky and start a monster fight between a Mancubus/Revenants,
and occasionally telefrag revenants if you're fast enough.

The second difference is in the endgame.  I cross over to get the
rockets first, instead of leaving them like Daniel does.  I also
leave the blue key.
