Description: Well, the next Henning's Max record is beaten. I was playing
             it for 2 hours and then i got 3:15 with 99% kills. I couldn't
             stop playing, so i carried on until i got this one. I had the
             same problem like Henning, coz it's not easy to get 100% kills
             here. I had about 20 demos faster than Henning, but always
             only with 99% kills. This demo is not optimal, even it's 9 sec.
             faster than Henning's record. I lost a few seconds when i was
             trying to go through those stupid animals. At the end you can
             see that i saved 36 cells. What a pity, i could use them to 
             kill something. :)
