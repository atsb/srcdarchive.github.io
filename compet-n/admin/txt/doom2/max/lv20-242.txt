Description:
This is my first Compet-N entry for Doom 2. 

What was most important in this route was the result of infighting between 
the cyberdemon and the master mind. One side rarely defeated the other side  
with very low health, so I aimed to kill it with a few rockets after a good 
infight and save a shot of BFG. I thought that the process in which I pick 
up a RL with dealing with the cyber or the mind was a little long when I used 
the strategy, so I got a RL in the early stage instead. Personally, I wanted 
the cyber to lose the fight because I was sometimes not able to hit it with 
rockets. I also wanted to aim to telefrag a cacodemon, but I gave it up because 
it was a rare case as well. I cleared the last area with only 4 shots of BFG 
and it's pretty smooth.

The previous record is 3:14 by Radek, but there was unofficial record which 
was 2:58 by hokis. I requested it from vdgg and dew for checking new tactics, 
but his route was just within the assumption. For instance, he cut a green 
armor and lowered a high wall first, though he didn't pick up the green armor 
for a faster record but I didn't get it because I had already had a blue armor. 
However, it was enough just to make sure there are no unexpectedly new routes. 
Vdgg and dew, thank you! 

I also included a failed demo. In the demo, the cyberdemon and the master mind 
killed each other at the same moment and I telefraged a cacodemon, though it 
was not a cacodemon in a blue armor's room. However, I missed 100% Kills because 
a imp escaped from the exit area. I was annoyed at this situation which occasionally 
happened.
