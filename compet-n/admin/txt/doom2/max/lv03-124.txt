Description:  Hey Ole, your route is really better but now you can say
              "bye-bye" to your record, hehe..It was quite easy to beat
              your record, it took me only a few months. :)
              The most important in this level is to have good start. It 
              means shotgun guys have to help you to kill all Imps. If
              you have a good start then is the rest of this level only 
              routine. Now i can go for map10. :)
              btw. I LOVE that music what is playing when you press Exit
              button.
