               Umn....remember the Compet-N rule Ian: Nothing is unbetable :)
               Well, ok...maybe map01 005, heh. But not the max-cat, noway.
               You have done some nice .lmps recently Ian. Keep it up. This
               2:35 of mine is full of crap. Beat this and fix it :) Then
               you'll force my lazy butt to play it over again :)
