Description: So it was after all possible to beat my old 01:01 record.
             I didn't think it would be possible when I completed that
             .LMP, but Kai-Uwe showed that it could be done...

             So I had to "work" some more to beat his 01:00 entry...
             This took me some hours but I got the record.

             I think it's almost impossible to beat 00:59, I had four
             tries at 01:00.
