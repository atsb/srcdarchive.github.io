  Description:

  There's some eyesores in this demo but it
  went OK I think.  The first one is that I
  started to run to the lift instead of going
  into that room to kill some imps.  Also I
  did a stupid switch to regular shotgun, and
  I kinda got blocked by the pigs while
  invulnerable.  Fortunately I had good luck
  with the cacos and arachnotron.
