  Description: 

  I'm satisfied with the time. It took me about one hour to
  get it under 3:20. At first I didn't think I was going for
  this record, cuz my first exit was 3:55. But after a few
  tries I got 3:24, that helped me a lot and I couldn't give
  it up. The most interesting on this demo is that I was 
  going to press "Q" when teleported on the pillar and jumped
  down, I thought I was falling off to the lava, but fortunately
  it didn't happen and I could carry on.
