              Hmm...come to think of it Ole havn't been very active
              for quite some time now. Would be neat to see him back
              at CN again. Oh, about this map...its crap for maxkill,
              100% luck related. Sub 1:20 is no problem with some more
              luck, but thats imo all there is to it which makes it
              rather uninteresting.
