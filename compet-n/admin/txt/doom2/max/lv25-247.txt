 Description: Small level with lots of action. The plasma-gun becomes
 a friend for life in this level, takes out bad guys very quickly.


 PS. "Demonlord" had a very good time of 2:53, I wasn't sure if that
 could be beat. I was very glad to see 2:47 pop up at the end-screen.


 PPS. Along with myself and Blake "Killer-B" Cole, the other half of
 the "Die-namic Duo", we wish to add a few more points to America's
 scoreboard.
