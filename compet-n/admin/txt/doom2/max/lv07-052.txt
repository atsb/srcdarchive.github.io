Description: This one was the most enjoyable by far.

             Daniel isn't even on the same planet as me and a guy called
             Vincent Smith (who has a great time of 54 secs).

             By the way, an added task is to get 100% (registered) items too.
             You can blame a guy called Pigman for this...
