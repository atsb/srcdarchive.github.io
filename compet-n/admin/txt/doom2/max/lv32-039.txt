Description: Took me some hours to complete...

             And when you get the megasphere there seems
             no reason to get the invulnarability.
             Gotta have some luck with the blue guys - how
             they walk and how your rockets hit them. Must
             also have some luck with the Cyberdemon, will
             take too much time if he stands for more than
             3 hits...
