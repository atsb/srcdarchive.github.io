Description:  A great map....Annoying imps in the "archi-tower". Besides from
              some need of luck there, it can be tricky to have enough plasma 
              for the end. The revenants better be dead when you climb the   
              final hill, or else it can be hard to consentrate on the cybie.
              Thanx to whoever came up with this route (think it was DL?)        
	      04:30 would be very good here btw...
