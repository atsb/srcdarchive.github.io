Description: I know I promised to not uploade more 1 sec. improvements. But
	     then I had a little discussion with Peo, whom reminded me that
             many of the max-entries are very optimized allready...I know
             that 1:17 is possible, cause I got close to this w/o 100%
             kills (1:19 to be exactly). All in all this is a very frustrating
             map to record when playing fast, though it's still one of my 
             favourites.
