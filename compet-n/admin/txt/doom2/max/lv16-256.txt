                           -----

Description: This was....FRUSTRATING. Peo's 2:58 was very good, and there
             are lots of things which simply depends on luck if time is going 
             to be good. I had a bunch of lot better recordings, among them a 
             02:44 with 95 kills and a 02:50 with 99% kills...I lost lots of 
             time in this recording cause of a  delayed mancubus, which I 
             really should have fed with a BFG.
            
             Maby I'll do this one again some (very boring) day...
