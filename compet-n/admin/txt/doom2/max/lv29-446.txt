Description: Cyber is quite easy and hopefully the Mancubus+Revenants
             kill each other. This level is in my opinion very hard,
             when speeding 100/100 simply because there are a lot of 
             badies and slime/poison everywhere.....................
             It's hard to save the plasma for the Cyber, I decided
             to use some for killing the Mancubus by the switch, this
             was because of my health status..
