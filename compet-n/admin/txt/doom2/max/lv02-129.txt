Description: I can't believe it, I can't believe it: Level 2 UNDER PAR.
             Every .LMP at this level looks improvable, but if you try,
             you will get to know how hard it is to beat even DL's 1:36
             Made 1:34 twice, but it wasn't good enough. But this .LMP.
             It's a historical moment...

             The way DL used was probably one of the fastest. Returning
             to the red door switch without using teleporter is slower.
             See how I missed the button at the end. :-( ?. Waiting for
             someone to improve this - It requires a lot of training to
             stay under 1:40.
