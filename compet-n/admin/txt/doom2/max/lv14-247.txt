  Description :-)

  Getting close to the par time ! An optimal .LMP might be under it.

  My second try now - first one, included is 2:57,  also better than
  the previous one.

  I have no idea why the time is so good... There are no super-great
  parts here though I must admit I'm pretty happy with this which is
  a rare occasion ;-)

  I just did it for fun. I didn't think I'd improve my old lv14-258,
  but here it is... I don't think I'll try it anymore unless someone
  beats this one and I have nothing better to do...

  Don't touch this one Peo and I won't touch that ugly level 10. ;-)
  Sorry I got the beautiful one and you the ugly one. ;-)

  If you think you can help making Final DooM .LMP's, contact me.
