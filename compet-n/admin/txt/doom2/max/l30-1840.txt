Description: I have not yet seen DL's 20700%, but I think he had more work.
             You can stand as long as you want and listen to the monsters
             telefragging. But it gets harder to place your last 3 rockets,
             because you will have problems with invisible shots.
             This .LMP is completely annoying, you don't have to see it.
             I think we should stop the maxkills competition, it will lead
             to 100000% and then you have to play it in map mode [ TAB ],
             when you want to see all the shots.
             Let's calculate, what the limit will be:
             3072 KByte / 220 KByte * 25200 = 350,000%
             The other way is to get the interval time of the icon thrower.
             After the placement of the first 16 monsters every other will
             count.

[  Admin. Note ;-(  Kai-Uwe is correct that the monsters continue to tele-
   frag each other and you can simply wait around for a highest kill count
   and so this .LMP ends the maximum kills entry, WON by Kai-Uwe, period !
