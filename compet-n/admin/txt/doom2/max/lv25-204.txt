Description: First I tried to do better than DL and kill all the enemies 
             without using the Archvile trick. This 2:04 was my best time after
             about 30 attempts. I thought I had 102% but I forgot a Spectre in
             the Megasphere-room. But DL left an Imp too...
             After my Map 25 Speed only yesterday (ok 2h ago) I wanted to do
             some slower stuff. If you want to beat this (shoudn't be that
             difficult), try to save (blood) plasma. Especially the jump after
             the blue key is hard to survive.
