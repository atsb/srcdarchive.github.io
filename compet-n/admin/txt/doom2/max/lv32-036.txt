  Description :-)

  Hmmm.... well this new 3M mousepad was worth the price I paid for it :-)
  I thought this level would be a good place for testing... but when I got
  0:36 96% kills after a few tries, the paranoid part of my brain said:
  "Hey Adam, if you don't do it now, someone will do it tomorrow".
  So I did it.

  Oh well, I don't know how that Cyberdemon died there, I guess my first
  BFG shot was very good?
