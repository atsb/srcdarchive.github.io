Description: Very nice map i think, one of my favourite. After two days of
             playing isn't bad this time. But in this demo are a lot of
             stupid mistakes. The optimal time could be about 4:40, so 
             don't wait and go for it Ole! :)
             
             Ole's route....of course.
