  Description:

  As this is the first entry of it's kind for normal UV, I hope it's OKay
  that I got only 77% secrets in level 10... I'm sorry but again, it's the
  first entry so until there's a better one... Also to make up for it I did
  LV 11 also. This time is not included of course, just a bonus.

  I based this .TXT file on Daniel's 0904UV01, I hope it's OKay ! Since it
  already has the levels in it.

  No special comments about the levels, I just played, without trying to be
  incredibly fast.

  So, I urge you people to do a better, faster one!

[  Admin. Note :-)  This kind of entry is NOT the kind of thing I was
   looking for, as missing a monster or a secret would make the whole
   .LMP "invalid", but if that's what you players want to play for...

   So be it ! To beat this entry you must score more kills(!) or more
   secrets(!) (possible) and/OR go FASTER _without_missing_anything_!

   Also, since this is so long and Yonatan has supplied his own table
   of data - Thanks Yonatan - I'll just believe the overall time that
   he claims and we'll accept that he missed only the one (?) secret.

   Oh, how many points does this score --> FIVE ! [ For now ;-) ]
