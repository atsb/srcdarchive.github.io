   ...and Time       03.16 
		     ------

		
Description: I like this level a lot, lot's of cells, and most important:
	     you can easily get the BFG ;)

	     Finaly I managed to beat DL's 03.22, after recording nonstop
	     for 7 houers now, belive it or not. Some houers ago I had 03.10
	     but unfortantly an Imp survived somewhere, In total frustration
	     I destroyed parts of my desk :(
             I think I keep this one as a memory.

	     Couldn't understand the time 03.16 in this demo, I was sure
	     the time would be somewhere around 03.30, to many mistakes to be 
             a DL-beater. 

	     The only thing you have to worry about are the cells. If you
	     have less than 400 when you meet the first archi in the yellow-key
	     area, then you need more than luck if you are planning to beat 
             this one. Still I think It's possible to breake the 03.10...
