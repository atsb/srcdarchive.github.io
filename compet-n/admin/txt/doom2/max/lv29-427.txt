Description:

A bit slow on the archie bit, but I had a little luck at the end by the
cyberdemon.

Btw the best recording on this map is Demonlord's tyson recording. Recommended
viewing! The first 35 minutes of it isn't that interesting (though well
played) but the ending makes it worth sitting through.
