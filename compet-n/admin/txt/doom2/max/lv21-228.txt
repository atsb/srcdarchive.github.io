Description:

I watched the movie "Leon" on video last night.  I recommend it highly btw,
I've seen it a few times.  Look for it as "The Professional" in North America
- oh that's right, if you're reading this you're in Europe, never mind.
Anyway, right after that I was in the mood for some "cleaning".  I knew that
2:34 wasn't going to last on this level, so I made a pre-emptive strike :-)

The major difference in this one is that I don't waste rockets on the imps
by the Mankies.  Those rockets are far more useful at the end.	Unfortunately
I didn't get any telefrags but some monster fighting made up for that
somewhat.
