Description: The route here is just too good, thanks Peo for creating it :-)
	     I like this level a lot, many things can go wrong in the exit
	     buliding, It's very easy to forget an imp behind the bares...
	     or a trooper for instance...
             
	     There are still lots of slow parts in this one, Peo's 06.04 was
	     hard to beat, though I found a way to cut a few secs..
