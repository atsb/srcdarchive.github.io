Description: Getting pretty tired here of the endless tries needed 
	     to get the proper infights going. I've had lots of 
	     tries ending at 2:12 and 2:13 with 97\98% kills, so 
             getting below 2:10 should be pretty challanging I think. 	             Good luck to anyone that gives it a try. Also, thanks 
             to stx-Vile for his lv11-217 demo, there sure are easier
	     records to take on :-)
