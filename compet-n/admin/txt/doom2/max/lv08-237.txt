 Description: Meh. Crap map for maxkill. All comes down to luck in the 
	      cyber room, I more or less waste a bfg this time on a lone
              baron (think of time saved if it had been used in the imp
	      room for instance?) I did a 2:32 with one monster left 
	      prior to this, that one also looked like crap. A really
	      lucky run here could cut alot of time. But thats the thing
	      with luck based runs; luck :p Oh, and thumbs up to the last
	      baron I kill. That guy got his timings down.
