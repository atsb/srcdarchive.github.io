COMMENTS:  Special Thanks to Pigman and Danny.  Pigman for getting me
           started on this damn level 7 speed kick. Danny for the
           competition, because without it I could have never been
           able to achieve this time.  I think this is about as fast
           as it can be done....(I've said that a few hundred times)
           I hope, because I just don't want to do this anymore. 
	   The nightmares are getting pretty bad.

MACHINE: AMD DX4/120 (256k cache), 16 Meg Ram , D.Stealth 64 (2 meg DRam)
         And *most importantly* a 400dpi ALPS 500 series mouse, with NO
         acceleration, vertical sensitivity ZERO, Horizontal cranked.

MY CONFIG: LMB=Foward/RMB=Fire, A=L.Strafe, W=Backwards, E=Fire, D=Use,
           SpaceBar=R.Strafe, Speed/Run is JoyB_Speed=31 in default.cfg
           Special thanks again to Danny for the Speed trick, no more
           key to press or key to wedge down.
