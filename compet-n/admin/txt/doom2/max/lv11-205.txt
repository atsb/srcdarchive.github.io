C-N entry #178.

Hahaha, this run is just unrelenting
bullshit.  I would be very accurate
in saying that it's the luckiest max
run ever, and as strange as this map
can be, it had to happen sometime.

The infights I get in this run are
just unreal... I'm still laughing
about what happens at the blue key
area.  I left a spider and two cacos
alive and they somehow killed each
other off.  I even missed one of the
20 cell ammo things later on and still
manage to kill all the spectres.  I'm
done here, messing with a bad mistake
is one thing but this luck is too much
for me. :)
