  Description :-)

  Damn, this was very hard to beat...
  Actually this run doesn't look very well... I was surprised at the
  exit that I got it... After five 0:45's I finally managed.

  I was 1.5 sec faster than Kai-Uwe at the yellow door, managed to keep
  some 0.8 till the exit. It is possible to pass the pigs with only 1 SSG
  shot, I had that a few times, but then it'll be harder backwards...
  Kai is right, the faster you get through first, the harder it'll be
  when coming back... I managed through with a total of four SSG's, I think
  it's possible to do it in three shots (one shot on your way there, two
  shots after). So consequently a 0:43 is possible, even 0:42 if you have
  BIG luck.

  Hmmm, exact time is 44.97 :)
  
  Heh, all speedruns from MAP28 till MAP32 are now mine (except MAP31s,
  who cares).

  Who made that par time anyway? :->
