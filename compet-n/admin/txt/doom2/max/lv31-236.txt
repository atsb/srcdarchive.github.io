Description: This was supposed to be my first compet-n entry 7 months ago :)
             Well, I did 02:59 back then and was about to upload it when I
             saw a new map 31 in 02:48 by Adam.....
   
             There are still mistakes to correct here, but you need luck 
             though. Some route modifications here and there, thats all
             for now :) 

             Hmm Think you all forgot the Rocket Luncher (why??), even
             Daniel didn't use it in his 03:03 record (neither did Panter) 
             I played awhile myself without the rockets.
             IMO you can profit on the rockets by using them in the end.
             But you may get a lucky shot elsewere w/o having to 
             change to Chaingun...had many demos ranging 02:40 - 02:50. So I
             was quit amazed when I saw 02:36 even though the Demo had lots
             of mistakes. Probably 02:30 or even 02:29 is possible ???
	     Well since (Super) Girlich got 0:29 in E1m1 then there are no 
	     real limits :))

             I just got to think of the plasma-gun, maybe it can help   
             bringing this one below 02:30. haven't tried it yet....will
             do so right away :-)
 
PS!  This was my last compet-n doom2 max, I had a fun time recording them
     all. My own favourite demos are probably lv04-107, lv15-542 and lv23-248.
     All in all most of my demos can easily be beaten by all of you DOOM'ers
     who have been playing some time :-) 
     
BTW  This map31 is also highly recommended in Tyson uv-mode.. I did a demo 
     in Tyson myself in 04:50, not to boring to watch I hope :)
