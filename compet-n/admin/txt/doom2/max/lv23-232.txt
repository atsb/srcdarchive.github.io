Description: First of all...great idea by Keene to use the barrels in the 
             main room to kill the pains with. But it makes things a bit messy.
             I also decided to use a diffrent tactic at the spider scene,
             leaving him and see how many of the little ones he had killed 
             when I returned. But most of the times he get-s killed and there 
             are some 3 or 4 archons left, but I have experienced only one 
             left :) So if you-re really lucky, time can come down to 02:10-15
             that-s my guess at least. Adam W also used the "barrel jump" 
             I personaly don-t think it-s worth the trouble. 
             If you can-t keep the barrels in the main room inntakt it-s not
             much trouble restarting IMO.
