Description: I can't believe it. Found a new way for this level. The start
             is slow and I have only little health left. The hidden Imps
             take two shots instead of one and I grab the medkits there. I
             leave the light switch so turn gamma correction and brightness
             up to highest level ;-)
             I don't jump to the yellow door, instead I wait until the way
             is raisen, but still this fast a time ? What time is possible
             here ? By the way, I tried e1m4-024 yesterday, and no chance
             at all ;-) A speed record from Steffen (the one and only DooM
             Schwarzenegger) that could possibly stay forever.
