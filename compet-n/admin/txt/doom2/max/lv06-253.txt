Description: Beating DL's 03.01 wasn't that hard, still I think it's possible
	     to be more lucky (take the fist part with the lift for instance)
	     I leave this one for know but I'll do it over later on, I know It's
	     possible to do this one below 02:50, maybe somewhere around 02:40
	     should be more like it..?
