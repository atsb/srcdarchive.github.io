Description:

This lmp was a long time in coming.  I've been playing this level
for quite a while.  At one point I thought I made a new record at
1:09, but Demonlord beat me to it.  Then I recently saw Henning's
fantastic 1:07.  I looked at my 1:09, and knew that there was another
3 seconds there in a faster route.  I made 1:07 three times, but
I couldn't give up as they all looked improvable.

At the start I kill the sarge, then turn left and kill the chaingunner,
instead of going right for the switch.	This might be slower, I'm not sure.
It is certainly safer!	Another change is that I go straight for the
SSG, the theory being that I can kill the imps faster with it.	At the
end I don't jump straight to the door, I take the teleporter because
I often mess up the jump.  It's just too annoying to make a good
run and then stumble at the final hurdle.
