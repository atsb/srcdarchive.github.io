Description: Esko have already broken DL's record with a 4:31, he did this
             half a year ago and mailed it to me. My .LMP could have been
             very good time-wise if that "storage-imp" hadn't fooled me 
             before I teleported. Lost many secs there. Its also possible to
             frag one more spider with BFG. I was lucky at some stages though,
             the exit may look bad, but it went fast (compared with Demonlord). 
             Now only map09 and 10 is left to do...
