Description:  I like this map, but playing maxkill here was quite 
              a disappointment for me. It wasn't as fun as I thought. 
              The good time depends on infights very much. If you spend
              one or two rockets more in the BFG room, you will have lot of
              problems in the room with lifts. This is first demo I was 
              lucky, unfortunately the time is just 4s over 5 mins.
