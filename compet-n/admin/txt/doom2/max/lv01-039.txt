  Description:

  I have been playing this map in max
  style for a long time now, but it has
  been only about 2 weeks since I discovered
  this new route.  It's clearly faster than
  the route Adam Hegyi used and the other
  new route that I used in re01-041, but
  only by about a second or two.  The
  beginning went so-so.  I exited the blue
  room around 28 seconds.  My best there is
  around 27.3 seconds.  Also, when the imp
  got stuck in the exit room that's usually
  just a nuisance but fortunately I was able
  to shoot that imp without losing much time,
  so I saved time by only using chainsaw on 1
  imp.  I'm also including Adam Hegyi's demo.
  It's really quite an awesome demo and I
  don't want this to take anything away from it.
