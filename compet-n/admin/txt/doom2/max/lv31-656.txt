  Description :-)

  Real fun beginning. No shots fired until a pack of demons entered.
  Can you say "fire-fight?" :) Actually, its not THAT hard. Once you
  get your boom-stick, the level's over (figurativly). Low point of
  health was 19%. Ouch. :) Too conservative with my BFG. Other than
  that, this run ruled BIG! Now lets see someone beat THIS!
