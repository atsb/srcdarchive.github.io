Description:

OK, _now_ I'm never going to play this level again.  Uhm, unless of course
someone beats this.  The time should really have been better.  Some real
clumsiness and shockingly bad aim with the shotgun at the end.	It
would have been nice if that baron hadn't teleported 0.01 seconds before my
bfg hit him too.
