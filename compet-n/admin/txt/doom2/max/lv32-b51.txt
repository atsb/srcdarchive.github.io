  LV32-b51.LMP - Ultra Violence

  Recorded using Doom2 v1.666 with a lv32-v19.wad for this
  lousy (secret) difference between versions 1.666 and 1.9
  & Converted to Doom2 v1.9

  So,
  Doom2 -PlayDemo with Version 1.9

  Doom2 - Level 32 - "Grosse"

  Kills    100%
  (Items   100)
  Secrets  100%  and Time  00:51

Computer: 486DX33 ISA with standard VGA and PC-Speaker

Comments: I have a 0:44 one for v1.666, where *no* secret is
          to be watched out for. But v1.9 has 6 of them, and
