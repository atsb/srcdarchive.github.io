  Description:

  A very cool map for Uv max. Lot of action all the
  way to the exit, you have to play very agresive and
  can't afford waste one or two SSG shots more anywhere.
  I'm glad I broke Ian's record, his record was two and
  half years old and in my opinion one the most solid
  UV max records. I would never say I will beat that, 
  three months ago was my best 5:12. Today I've been kinda
  lucky. 
 
  Enjoy!
