Description: Huh.....my first try can't really understand that...
             demo sucks....looks like crap. I did play a bit sloppy, as I
             always do, espessialy in my early tries. I wasted a bfg...3 or
             4 rockets + I really don't think I was that lucky.

             heh, look out for more max versions of this one
