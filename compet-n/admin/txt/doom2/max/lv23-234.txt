Question: If a person uses the speedrun rotue at the start, how much time can
          be saved?

Answer: 1 second, according to this demo ;). Sorry to only improve by such a
        small amount, Keene, and I wouldn't have uploaded this except that the
        route is changed. On this route you get through the start quicker and
        are able to kill more pinkies early, too. This would've been 2-3 secs
        faster if i hadn't somehow managed to forget the route at the end :).
        I forgot to shoot the last set of barrels, then missed shooting the
        single barrel first time :). Optimal is tough to say, about 2:20
        maybe.
