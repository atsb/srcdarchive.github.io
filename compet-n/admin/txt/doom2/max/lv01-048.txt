Comments: This time without a single strafe 50 tic :) It doesn't look
	  that nice, but the time is fast, believe me. I played that map
	  last some years ago, ending with a 0:49 and one (second best) 0:51.
	  Yesterday, I got 0:51 and even 0:50 after only a few minutes of
	  play, all in all I've recorded not less than 7 times a 0:51 and
	  also three times a 0:50. Surprisingly no 0:49. I just wonder what
	  a time this could have been if the rocket had killed/hurt one more
	  Imp, because it's a 48,54. It's really only the SSG room where all
	  the Soldiers die incredible fast, that's why I expect that somebody
	  can still improve it.
	  Btw, this LMP differs slightly from the 0:49. That's because I
	  don't care anymore for the last Soldier when he walks to the health
	  potions but kill him on the way back. This means, that the Imps
	  outside wake up and don't catch the rocket that fine as if they
	  would have been waken up by my first rocket. But as it seems, it is
	  no big difference in time.

	  Places I dunno how to avoid to loose time:
	  1) After you've killed the Imp on the elevator, you have to wait
	    some tenth to go on.
	  2) You have to wait for the Imp's secret door.
	  3) You loose time because you'll take out Pistol before Shotgun
	  
	  I tried to avoid both 1) and 2) (but times were around 0:58) as
	  follows: kill the Imp at the elevator, open the door, sneak to
	  the secret, kill the other secret Imps (which came out), return
	  to the elevator and kill 2 Imps while it goes up.
	  I've got it once or twice that 3) didn't happen, maybe with almost
	  all health you can fire the rocket at closer range.

	  Hi Peo, this long text extra for you. Hope you've got the necessary
	  disc space to read it :)
