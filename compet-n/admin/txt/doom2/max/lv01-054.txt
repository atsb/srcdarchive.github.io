  Secrets  100%  and Time  00:54
                           -----


Computer: P/100 with Matrox Millenium and AWE32 (Dasa's one)
          - Oh I love the smooth running.


Comments: I tried hard to beat the old record - which has already been
          pushed under 1:00 - but on a P/100 it was a case of 7 tries.
          Right after a 0:55, a 0:54 (this one). From record to record
          1-2 sec less, when will this end? The Ultimate Record should
          be around 0:45. Who will get there first?
