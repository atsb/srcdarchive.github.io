  Description :-)

  "The level 14 collection"

  In this .ZIP are also my previous tries from today, they are:

  1st try - 3:08
  2nd try - 3:07
  4th try - 3:04
  5th try - 3:00
  7th try - 2:58

  Tries in the middle are either unsuccessful (I died...) or not fast enough.

  What's most annoying is that the 2:58 isn't all that good... Only 1 batch
  file inside, for the fastest (2:58), if you don't like it, just type
  manually the doom2 -playdemo lv14-???, your problem, they are here as a
  bonus, just for your fun.
