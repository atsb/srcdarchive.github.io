                           -----

Computer: 486DX33 ISA with standard VGA and PC-Speaker ;-)

Comments: Saw the 0:58. Thought I could improve it. But it's
          not so easy to get onto this platform :-(. At least
          if you have a DX33. Placed one rocket too low.
          But I show you the way to make it faster. Watch the lmp.
          Besides: Formerly I had problems simply to end the level.
