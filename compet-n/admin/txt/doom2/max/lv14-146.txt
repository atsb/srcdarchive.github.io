C-N entry #65.

When I first started running this level, I couldn't get below two minutes. :)
Eventually I got a 1:52 and just couldn't stop playing it.

I think my approach to the archvile room helps out quite a bit, as it keeps him
moving in a straight line the majority of the time.

One last note: this run is 3 seconds faster than the TAS record (by Peo) so I
guess it can't suck THAT bad. :)
