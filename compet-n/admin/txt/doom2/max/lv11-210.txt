C-N entry #176.

Thanks for the compliments Henning,
I really enjoyed your demo too. Glad
to see you back in the game. :)

I got tired of the annoying luck-
related scenarios in this map as well,
but it's still addicting, so I stuck
around for further improvements until
I felt like moving on.  There was only
one mistake in this run that I didn't
like, I saw the caco live through the
BFG shot out of the corner of my eye
and caught him before heading down...
only one second lost though, since the
final time was a high 2:10.94.
