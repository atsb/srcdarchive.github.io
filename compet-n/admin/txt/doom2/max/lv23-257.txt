Description: Nice level, cool design and very nice when speeding 
             through 100/100. It's mainly the first part until you
             reach the Megasphere that can be trublesome, the final
             part is easy. It can however sometimes be quite tricky 
             to get the spiders fight the Mastermind, that is of 
             course only if the time of the lmp is important.....
