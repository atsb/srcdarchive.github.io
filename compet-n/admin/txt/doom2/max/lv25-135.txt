  Ah...what took you so long Andy ? It's now nearly 3 years and still 
  nothing from you. This could motivate you a bit. ;)

  The demo is ok. I was lucky in the blue-key area that all pigs died
  and I even don't know how. On the other hand I made a silly mistake
  at the end, I didn't press the switch on the first hit, what a lame..
