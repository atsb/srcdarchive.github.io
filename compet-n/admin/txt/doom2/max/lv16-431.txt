  Description :-)

* The secret rate is only 75%, I know that. But watch the .LMP and
see for yourself I get all the secrets. I suspect that secret near
2 is the one to blame, you must get into the lowering of the floor
completely when you get the megasphere, I tried as good as I could,
but you never know if its gonna count or not.

  First of all, this one great .LMP !! :-) BUT - you knew that was
  coming didn't you ;-) Getting 100% secrets is not too difficult,
  as others have done so. I believe that the problem is NOT at the
  megasphere but in the method of getting the other secret in this
  same room - The DB "Shout" Gun may have a good "blast" radius...
  but using that secret step wouldn't be any slower.

  So, does this one count ? I just can not descide... You judge...

 Daniel,

 Download the other LV16-???.ZIP to see where you're going "wrong"
 and record another .LMP... That'll remove this "?" question mark.
                                                 ^
 Also, there was some "rubbish" at the very end of your .LMP - So,
 I "chopped" it out ;-)

 Thanx for the .LMP :-)

 S.;-) aka. "The Judge"
