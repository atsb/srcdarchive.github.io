Description: This level is much trickier than you would expect, especially
             when Pain Elementals who used to be "harmless" start spitting
             skulls. In nightmare mode all the pain elementels on this
             level are "harmless" and so they were in a .LMP (in UV) that
             I watched just a while ago, this is really strange because in
             my games they spit skulls all the time.
