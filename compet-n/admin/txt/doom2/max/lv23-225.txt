  Description : Well... I got this level back, at least until somebody
                decides they need the points more than me. :)
                Slightly different route, with the barrel jump and Henning's
                idea to leave the spiders and return later. I also destroy
                the barrels near the start, but not as many pain elementals
                were killed as I'd hoped leaving me with more work to do
                later.
