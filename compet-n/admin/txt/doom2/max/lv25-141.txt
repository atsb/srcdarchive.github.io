 Description: 

	Another level i can do :)
        8s faster than Anders... but i must admit than i was quite lucky 
        in many scenes :)
        The blue key may seem hard to do ... but it's easy to hit Q and restart
        when you are too slow or you hear a pig while going upstairs.

        Around 1:35 seems possible... Anders ? :)

P.S. : In fact that's the first time i'm quite proud of a demo :-)
       it's nearly flawless ! Quite rare in maxkills runs...
       everything went almost perfectly !
