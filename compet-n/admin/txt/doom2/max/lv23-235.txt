  Description : Question: If a person doesn't kill the Pain Elementals at
                the start, how much time can be saved?

                Answer: Thirteen seconds according to this demo. I think
                that the key is to keep the barrels in the main room intact,
                so that as many Pain Elementals die as possible when they
                do blow up. Doing it like this makes it difficult to ensure
                that all of them are dead though, I kept getting 98% or 99%
                kills. I had to restart quite a lot as well since the barrels
                would often explode to early, before the Pain Elementals
                wandered into them blissfully unaware of the trap that lay
                before them.

                Well, this only my second COMPET-N demo. Same map as before
                though. I got 2:43 but I decided to go for more. (Or less
                depending on how you look at it.)
