Description: Ahmn...well, for all of you who thought the norwegian invasion
	     was over, think again :-) From this point of I'll play Compet-N
             like a madman. This Plutonia collection helped a bit developing
             my playing I think. Had expected Daniel's 2:13 to be hard to beat.
             But after getting 2:12 at my third try I changed my mind. Only 
	     played until I got below 02:10, lots of crappy mistakes in this 
             one. Boy it feels good to make a demo with less than 5-10 hours
             of hard work (like with some pl-maps).

             I expect to do some new Doom1 max-entries soon, still lots of maps
             left in epis 2 & 3 ;-) Sometime I'll start on that epis4 NM-run
             too (like I promised you Panter :-) Oh well, back to Doom!
