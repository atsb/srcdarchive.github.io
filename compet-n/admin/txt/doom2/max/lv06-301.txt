Description: This level is very hard speeding through, beating
             Peo's 03.07 was VERY hard. You must have a lot of
             luck on this level for it to work, especially the
             Spider Mastermind is important, she must start 
             firing at the Imps or you just have to restart.
             The jump to the second Mega is still hard and I
             only make it about 75% of the tries.................
