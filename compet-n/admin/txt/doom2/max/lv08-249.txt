Description:

Ugly demo, especially killing that first baron, but got the job done.
This lmp _looks_ slow, no idea how I got the time.
It's weird, I played this map for about 2 hours a few days ago, but couldn't
beat Henning's time, so I left it.  Then I played again today for a bit and
made it the first time I hit the exit.
