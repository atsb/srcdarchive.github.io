  Description:

  This is one of those maps where it seems
  always something goes wrong, like I will
  fall down somewhere, hurt myself with a
  rocket or those cacos teleport and I have
  to wait a long time for them.  But this time
  things went pretty well.  I left a caco alive
  and the imps didn't come out like they are
  supposed to but in there things die pretty
  quickly.  Also I got stuck on the pigs in
  end so that cost a little too.  I think next
  time it would be a good idea to use more
  rockets.
