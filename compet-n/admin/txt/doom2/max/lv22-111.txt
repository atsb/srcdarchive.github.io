  Description: 

  It wasn't very hard to beat Henning here, altho I didn't
  feel like it at the beginning. I started off with the times
  slightly over 1:20, but my first 1:17 demo came after a hour.
  I was improving it second by second, later on I was getting
  times under 1:17 quite constantly. Of course, telefraging 
  the revenant is important to get fast time. I think this
  demo is not that bad, but still improvable.
