Description:

Oh dear, this run is a comedy of errors.  The only reason I beat
Anders' time is because the route is faster I think.  The map's quite
easy, the only problem being the invisible demon guys at the end.  I hate
them.  I need a big flashing arrow on the screen or something telling me
where they are.

There's another 5 seconds on this map at least, maybe 10 considering all
the mistakes.  I made 2:28 once but I missed one of the %^$&* demons.
