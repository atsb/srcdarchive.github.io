Description: This must have been one of DL's very old records. I'm sure he
             improves mine soon. My problem was not to get 100% kills, but
             all of the secrets. Often had 94%, but I didn't know which of
             the 19 I missed. There is much time for improvement left, eg.
             the spiders at the BFG could have one shot with it, and I run
             most of the way twice. What will be your time DL? Trying hard
             for 7:30 ?
