===================================
Description:

It was not hard to beat Radek's record, so I set my target at under 3 min. 
However, it was pretty hard. I tweaked the route many times, then I finally 
cut 4 rockets in a room and expected more effective infighting and behavior 
of BFG. Of course, it seldom happened. I was also annoyed that 100 Kills 
was not gotten easily, like Radek and Henning said. These causes increased 
the difficulty of my target.
