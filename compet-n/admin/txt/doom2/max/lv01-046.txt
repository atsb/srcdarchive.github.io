  Description :-)
  
  Finally I managed... Been trying for a week now, 2-3 hours each day...
  Got no less than 7 0:47's with 100% kills, and 13 0:46's with 96% kills.
  
  The little trick I used saves half a second... I'm curious if this REALLY
  wasn't discovered for years?

  This was the second hardest thing I've ever done behind lv07-048...
