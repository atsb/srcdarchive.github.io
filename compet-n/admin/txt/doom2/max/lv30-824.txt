Description: Even if it is annoying. (-timedemo ?)
             Evil Monsters are: Archviles
                                Pain Elementals
                                Ravenants
                                Cyberdemon
                                Spider Mastermind
                                Heavy Weapon Dude
                                The last 3 don't appear :-(
             I like:            Imps
                                Spectres
                                Pigs (What's their exact name ? Demon ?)
                                Soldiers
                                SS Soldiers
                                The last 2 don't appear :-(
             Indifferent are:   Cacodemons (they climb the levels themselves)
                                Barons & Knights
                                Mancubus'
                                Arachnotrons
                                Seargents

I had some nice scenes while recording (not that, perhaps):
                                A Mancubus fired, but nothing appeared.
                                A spider fell down one level.
