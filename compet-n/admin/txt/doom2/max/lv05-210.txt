Description:	Yawn. Got a 2:11 almost at once, but then several attempts
	        followed where those !#?!!@! spectres in the end decided
                to annoy the hell out of me. They are by far the main 
                problem. This was a very sloppy looking go (of course, those
		are always the ones that lead to the exit...), I had some
		that looked alot better but turned out slower. Also had one
		with a jelly pig left in the end at 2:06. Low 2 minute run
		shouldn't be too hard if you don't commit suicide in
		frustration over those....ehem...BASTARDS in the end scene.
		Used Peos TAS route, why didn't we do that years ago. Changed
		the rocket usage around a bit tho. I'd say that TAS time could
		be improved quite a bit too btw, have some ideas for faster
		strategies here, but I'll save them for later if needed.
