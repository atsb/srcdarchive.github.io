Description: Earlier today Anders made 0.47 in speeding, incredible, 
	     whatched it three times......so I was inspired to do this one in
	     100\100 speeding....

	     I know it dosn't look that great and all that, I didn't even 
	     telefraged the revenant with the blue key....now that requires
	     LUCK, dam that shit !!
	     There are room for big improvments in this one so I guess I have
	     to return some day..??
