	      Done with it forever? =) Nah, plenty of room for improvement 
	      here. This one won't be optimized. Its not so much luck to get
	      a time between 1:10 - 1:15 imo, just a so-so go where the	
              monsters act as they do 50% of the time and someone who know
	      how to use the ssg. A 1:05 would need luck tho, with barrels 
	      and infights. A oneshot kill in the exit room is not too
              hard to get here, and would save time. I might do another
	      one if you bother to improve this one...we'll see. Took about
	      one and a half hour to do, havn't really played doom since
              the summer lan, got a bit of a overkill after two weeks of 
              constant DM'ing and coop =) I hope to make an AV christmas 
	      releas, almost nothing left to do before its done.
	      
              oh, btw Radek, thanks for the postcard, that was a cool 
	      surprise hehe...:) Keep up that maxkilling btw, I always enjoy
	      watching your latest demos over tnt and udoom, your style 
	      is much more enjoyable to watch than mine for instance, I 
	      never seem to get any smoother :)
