Description: Incredible.....I was board and since I really don't have any
             other computer games than this, I sat down playing this one.
             So after 45 min of playing I was still in avrage 10-15 sec
             behind Ian but that didn't really matter anyway. I just played 
             for fun :)) Then this time showed up......hmm strange IMO I have
             been having better attempts than this one.....but who cares now.
             
             Yeah 02:05 would be out of this world I think but 02:15 should
             be reachable next time I suppose :-)
