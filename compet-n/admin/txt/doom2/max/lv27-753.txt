  It is POSSIBLE to trigger the secret in the teleporter in the
  pain elemental room - I've done it before.  Unfortunately, I
  have no idea how I did it other than I entered the sector and
  failed to teleport.  Duplicating it in a recording would be
  nothing short of a miracle.


 [ Way better than the previous best and "real" entry of 15:14 ]
