Description: This lmp is bad news...sorry :( Obviously not a map which suits
             my playing. I did a lousy job most of the time. So why not do
             it over again? Cause I really don't feel like playing this map
             anymore...dunno why; its not a bad level. 

             Anyway; I wanna thank Peo. He gave me some tips on how to 
             improv his old record.
