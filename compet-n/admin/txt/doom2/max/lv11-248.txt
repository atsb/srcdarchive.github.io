Description: When I first started at this lev11 recording I had several routes 
	     in mind, but they all turned down to be 10-20 sec slower.....So I 
	     guess I have to thank DL for the route again, but I had to make 
             changes, and since he exit with so many rockets I thought that I 
             might could use them on the cacos in the blue key area (hate 
             slow fights with the ssg and chaingun)
             
             This is one of my favorit doom2 maps, played it for many hours
	     and days, not all the time of course. DL's 02.51 was extremely 
	     hard to beat.
