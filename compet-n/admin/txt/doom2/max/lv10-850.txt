Description: If someone would have told me 5 months ago that I would
             beat Demonlord's best entry on level 10, I would have
             asked that someone to check into a psychiatric clinic!
             The first time I beat this map was in February, and the
             time was 48:25 !!!!!
             Did an earlier try at 8:09 with 94% secrets;-( So there
             is still room for improvements !
