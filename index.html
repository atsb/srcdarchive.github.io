<h2>What is SRCD</h2>
<p>SRCD is the continuation of Compet-N and Competition Doom since the current maintainer of the website for these has stated that by July 2022, the website will be removed.  This ensures the years of demos and the legacy these have with the Doom Community will continue to be available</p>
<h2>Contributions</h2>
<h3>Compet-N</h3>
<p>Same rules apply still.  See below</p>
<a href="https://github.com/atsb/srcdarchive.github.io/blob/main/compet-n/admin/naming_2013.txt" class="square_btn">Naming Conventions</a><br/><br/>

<h2>How to contribute new Compet-N demos</h2>
<ol>
    <li>DOOM.EXE/DOOM2.EXE can only be used (via DOSBox)</li>
    <li>Create an issue, with the Naming Conventions and Naming Examples forms filled out and with an issue title of "NEW ENTRY - <entry description>"</li>
    <li>Include the forms, the demo LMP file and any other information as an attachment to the issue (player info etc..) inside a zip file.  Please see 'compet-n/admin/examples'</li>
</ol>
<p>Verification will then be performed and once verified, will be added to the archive.</p>
<h2>What source port can we use for Competition Doom (CNDoom)?</h2>
<p>The only source port that can be used is SRCD-Doom, which is 'the' source port for strict vanilla competition demos (for Windows and macOS)</p>
<a href="https://github.com/atsb/SRCD-Doom/releases" class="square_btn">SRCD-Doom</a><br/>
<p>Users on Windows can also use the launcher for SRCD</p>

<h2>How to contribute new SRCD Demos</h2>
<p>This is largely the same as for Compet-N however the rules are much more relaxed.  Please see any existing srcd demo zip file for the content that you are expected to provide.</p>
<ol>
	<li>SRCD-Doom (windows or mac) must be used</li>
	<li>Create an issue with the title "NEW SRCD ENTRY - <entry description>"</li>
	<li>Place a zip file with your demo and any text information you would like to add as an attachment to the issue (see the above links for Compet-N) for examples</li>
	<li>zip file and demo name should be (example): doom1-speed-e3m7-0005289.zip</li>
	<li>See: https://github.com/atsb/srcdarchive.github.io/issues/1 as an example for submissions on SRCD</li>
</ol>
<h2>Are Tyson runs allowed in SRCD</h2>
<p>Yes, any run that is allowed in Compet-N is allowed in SRCD</p>
<h2>COMPET-N Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.)</h2>

<h3>Q: What is COMPET-N / SRCD?</h3>
<p>A: COMPET-N and SRCD is aimed to collect the fastest single-player and co-operative demos of each level of DOOM/DOOM2.
We also collect demos for DOOM or DOOM2 episodes and DOOM2 full game runs (these are collectively called "movies").
We have eight basic categories: UV Speed, UV Max, NM Speed, NM 100% secrets, UV -respawn, UV -fast, UV Pacifist, UV Tyson.
Anyone can send a demo if they manage to beat the existing record for a map.</p>

<h3>Q: How do I join COMPET-N / SRCD?</h3>
<p>A: Anyone can join who beats an existing record. There is no "membership" or "application" of any kind.  Please provide these details too if possible:
full name, nickname, country, webpage</p>

<h3>Q: OK, but where are the demos?</h3>
<p>A: COMPET-N's demo site is <b>https://github.com/atsb/srcdarchive.github.io</b>. The directory structure is pretty much self-explanatory, I don't think you'll have trouble finding any LMP.</p>

<h3>Q: How do I find out what is the current record in a category/map?</h3>
<p>A: Easy, you just go to the Database.</p>

<h3>Q: How do I send my demos?</h3>
<p>A: See the 'How to Contribute' section for both COMPET-N and SRCD</p>

<h3>Q: What are the requirements in the categories?</h3>
<p>A: I'm trying to describe each category the simplest way, and give a detailed explanation with exceptions on the top of this page:</p>

<p>The above rules apply to all wads, not only Doom/Doom2 and also applies to SRCD.</p>

<p>Note that other LMPs are also accepted (as nomonsters, coop, net-x or misc entries).</p>

<h3>Q: Hey, my awesome record is both speed and pacifist (or nightmare and nightmare 100% or something else)?</h3>
<p>A: If your record belongs to two different categories then you have to upload it twice or more, depending for how many categories demo is.</p>

<h3>Q: How do I know how to name my demos?</h3>
<p>A: See the 'How to Contribute' section.</p>

<h3>Q: Do you accept millisecond improvements? (e.g. 26.84 down to 26.23)</h3>
<p>A: Yes, but only for SRCD Doom. To beat an existing COMPET-N record, you'll have to do at least one second better (taken by the intermission screen).</p>

<h3>Q: What happened to Steffen Winterfeldt's and Uwe Girlich's demos?</h3>
<p>A: Steffen Winterfeldt's DOOM2 NightMare! Run is the most debated demo ever created. In late 1996, 
discussions started whether Steffen's and Uwe's demos are cheated or not. Most of the players had the opinion 
that both players cheat with slowmotion. They asked Simon to disqualify them, but actually Simon never did it. 
(I wasn't there, Istvan tells Simon accepted Uwe's cheating, but not Steffen's.) When Istvan took over, both players 
have been disqualified, even though their demos are still available over COMPET-N. I know that many people still don't 
believe these players cheated, all I can say, that a decision had to be made. Even though no one can be 100% sure, the 
opinion of the COMPET-N veterans is what counts most. The admin is just there to make the decision. Despite the incident, 
the players aren't angry at Steffen and Uwe now, because they had a large role creating new routes and tactics.</p>

<h3>Q: What about DOOM Done Quick? Isn't that COMPET-N / SRCD?</h3>
<p>A: No.</p>

<h3>Q: I saw this/that demo and I saw a trick which I couldn't do. Did the guy cheat?</h3>
<p>A: No. I recommend watching the trick again and again, paying attention to the details. Then practice and practice until you can do it. The key word for the success of most COMPET-N "gods" is practice.</p>

<h3>Q: What is strafe50? What is a strafe50 mousedriver? Are these allowed?</h3>
<p>A: As you probably know, there are two ways of strafing. Strafing with separate keys, or with a single key (strafe-on button). If you strafe with separate keys, your relative strafing speed will be 40, while strafing with a strafe-on button, it will be 50 (hence the name: strafe50). This is an advantage when straferunning, as your speed is about 10% higher. However, you also have a disadvantage: you cannot turn while pressing the strafe-on button.
On to the 2nd question: a strafe50 mousedriver is a special utility which makes strafe50 running "automatic". When you're straferunning but not turning, you'll strafe with 50 speed, but when you turn, the driver automatically switches back to 40. The advantage is that you can still use your separate strafing keys (basically it allows strafe50 with separate keys, not just strafe-on). Because of the automated working, it's much more effective than doing it "by hand". But because this gives an unfair advantage, such mousedrivers are not allowed. On the other hand, strafe50 itself (without the driver) is allowed. Some players don't use it at all, some players use it just for jumps and tricks, and some players use it regularly.
Cheating with strafe50 mousedrivers can be detected. So please do not use them and play fair!</p>

<h3>Q: Does COMPET-N / SRCD accept tool-assisted demos?</h3>
<p>A: No, there is a page dedicated to those, the Tool-Assisted Speedruns website. COMPET-N accepts built demos though (outside competition).</p>

<h3>Q: Will COMPET-N / SRCD expand to more PWADs?</h3>
<p>A: Possibly yes. When the need arises, it will.</p>

<h3>Q: Why doesn't COMPET-N cover Heretic 1-2/Hexen 1-2/Quake 1-2/anything else?</h3>
<p>A: COMPET-N was always meant for DOOM/DOOM2 only. Note that there is a similar site for Quake 1-2, it is the Speed Demos Archive. 
If you want to try Heretic speedrunning, try Heretic-N or the Public Demo Archive of the Non Gods.  SRCD however fully supports Heretic and Hexen.
