<h1>SRCD Demo Archive</h1>
<h2>What is SRCD</h2>
<p>SRCD is the continuation of Compet-N and Competition Doom since the current maintainer of the website for these has stated that by July 2022, the website will be removed.  This ensures the years of demos and the legacy these have with the Doom Community will continue to be available</p>
<h2>Contributions</h2>
<h3>Compet-N</h3>
<p>Same rules apply still.  See below</p>

<h2>How to contribute new Compet-N demos</h2>
<ol>
    <li>DOOM.EXE/DOOM2.EXE can only be used (via DOSBox)</li>
    <li>Create an issue, with the Naming Conventions and Naming Examples forms filled out and with an issue title of "NEW ENTRY -"</li>
    <li>Include the forms, the demo LMP file and any other information (player info etc..) inside a zip file.  Please see 'compet-n/admin/examples'</li>
</ol>
<p>Verification will then be performed and once verified, will be added to the archive.</p>
<h2>What source port can we use for Competition Doom (CNDoom)?</h2>
<p>The only source port that can be used is SRCD-Doom, which is 'the' source port for strict vanilla competition demos.</p>
